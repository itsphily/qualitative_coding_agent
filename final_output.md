- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.
  
  Status: Project complete and report published

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly assesses and adjusts its operational processes by addressing the unique logistical challenges of delivering cash transfers in remote areas. By using mobile money as a tailored solution, the charity is calibrating its intervention to local geographic needs to achieve greater cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Benchmarking a traditional nutrition and WASH program to cash
  
  Researchers: Craig McIntosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action
  
  Location: Kayonza and Nyabihu districts, Rwanda
  
  Overview: The study explored the cost-effectiveness (impact per dollar) of unconditional cash transfers and of Gikuriro, an integrated nutrition program. It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study's primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey. For secondary outcomes studied, the smaller cash transfer program decreased debt and increased assets, while the nutrition program increased savings.
  
  Registration: AEA registry entry.
  
  Status: Working paper and IPA policy brief published in 2018

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly experiments with different cash transfer sizes in a specific location (Rwanda) to benchmark cost-effectiveness. Calibrating the intervention amount based on observed outcomes reflects an operational adjustment tailored to local needs.

- **Quote:** Benchmarking the impact of cash transfers in Malawi
  
  **Location:**: Machinga and Chiradzulu districts, Malawi
  **Overview:**: This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes ($250 to $750) on a broad range of outcome measures, for a broad range of recipients. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions in Malawi can be assessed. It will also test whether improving access to agricultural input markets increases the impact of cash transfers.
  **Study registration:**: Registration pending
  **Status:**: Baseline surveying and cash payments launched in 2019

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is piloting varied cash transfer amounts and considering local economic factors like agricultural input market access in Malawi. Such calibration of intervention parameters to local contexts is integral to adjusting operational processes for improved cost-effectiveness.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusted its operational processes in Uganda by reorganizing roles—a change informed by the more robust structure already in place in Kenya. Although not explicitly mentioning cost effectiveness, this separation is an example of calibrating interventions to the local operational challenges, potentially reducing risks (such as fraud) and thereby improving overall efficiency and cost outcomes.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly's shift in financial transfer methods to better match local conditions. By opting for MTN Mobile Money, which offers a broader network of agents, the charity adapts its process to address the constraints of the local context. This calibration of operational intervention is intended to improve service delivery, which can contribute to greater cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
  
  In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes by calibrating the cash transfer amounts based on local economic conditions such as inflation. In Kenya, rising inflation necessitated a 30% increase in transfer amounts, while the situation in Uganda required a different calibration. This direct adjustment ensures that the interventions remain effective and cost-efficient across diverse locations.

- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
  
  The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its targeting mechanism to the specific characteristics of a location. Recognizing that thatch is uncommon in Homa Bay County, the organization is exploring alternative proxy tests to better identify extreme poverty, thereby calibrating its intervention criteria to local conditions in pursuit of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner.
  Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly is experimenting with alternative distribution models in Uganda to better suit local infrastructure and recipient needs. By piloting a distributed cashout model, the charity is adapting its operational process to overcome local challenges (such as limited cell phone penetration and travel distances), which supports its broader goal of achieving cost effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows a deliberate geographic adjustment in operational processes. By relocating the call center to Kampala while field staff remain in Mbale, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention logistics to local structural needs, which can contribute to reducing risks (such as fraud) and enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.

  **Reasoning:** This operational change reflects an effort to consolidate oversight in response to local challenges in Uganda. By centralizing management of cash out days, the charity adapts its processes to local conditions, aiming to mitigate losses and improve efficiency, which are key to cost effective interventions.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is actively revising its intervention methods—both in how funds are disbursed and in whom they target. Such modifications suggest an attempt to calibrate interventions to local demographic or contextual needs, thereby potentially optimizing resource allocation and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.

  **Reasoning:** By involving local community members as monitors during cash out days, GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to leverage local knowledge and address context-specific challenges. This calibration to local conditions helps to detect issues early, indirectly supporting cost effective management of interventions.

- **Quote:** Targeting in Homa Bay
  All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes based on local feedback and context by adopting new targeting criteria in Homa Bay, while using different criteria in Uganda. This calibration to local needs is directly related to the research question regarding how charities tailor interventions to achieve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:
  * Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: 
    * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. 
    * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the organization’s intent to modify its distribution methods based on the infrastructural realities of different locations. By proposing tailored approaches for areas without sufficient mobile-payment infrastructure, GiveDirectly is adjusting its operational processes to ensure interventions are both feasible and cost-effective.

- **Quote:** While a full universal basic income would not be feasible at the present time in some of the least developed countries because of budget constraints, there are other countries where it would be feasible. GiveDirectly also believes that the experiment will still be policy relevant even to budget-constrained country governments, as there are many potential variations that would be feasible (e.g., versions targeted to particular regions).

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is considering variations of its intervention tailored to the fiscal and contextual realities of different regions. By acknowledging that different versions might be implemented based on regional capacities, it speaks to the process of calibrating interventions to meet specific location needs and achieve cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes by focusing on areas where they already operate, calibrating their intervention strategy based on the cost efficiency of serving a large population of the extreme poor without the overhead of new operations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates that the organization adapts its operational processes to meet location-specific challenges, such as strict local regulations in Rwanda, thereby calibrating their approach to maintain efficiency and effectiveness in that setting.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is actively experimenting with different intervention models in Rwanda, which is an example of calibrating interventions to local needs in order to determine the most cost-effective approach.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that DSW customizes its intervention by selecting target areas based on local health data and water infrastructure characteristics, thereby ensuring that the intervention is tailored to the specific needs of different locations in a manner that promotes cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote details the specific local criteria used to determine where to install dispensers, illustrating how the charity calibrates its operational process according to local environmental conditions and user density to optimize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** we asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of how the charity adjusts its operational processes based on pilot feedback by modifying installation guidelines to better suit local accessibility needs, thereby improving the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that DSW is actively experimenting with and calibrating its incentive structures to better incentivize local champions, an approach that aligns operational processes with the specific behavioral and contextual characteristics of different communities to enhance cost effectiveness.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows how GiveDirectly adapts its operational process by implementing cash out days—an intervention calibrated to local conditions (inadequate mobile money agent networks) in order to lower recipients’ transportation costs and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence of advance planning and coordination tailored to local logistics. The charity customizes its process by clearly communicating withdrawal details and coordinating with local mobile money agents, indicating an operational adjustment aimed at efficiency and cost reduction.

- **Quote:** After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once.

  **Reasoning:** This detailed description illustrates an adaptive operational response during a cash out day. By shifting from individual follow-ups to grouping recipients by issue, GiveDirectly efficiently addresses localized challenges, a clear example of calibrating intervention processes to the specific operational context for improved cost effectiveness.



# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity’s intervention.

### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly deliberately adjusted its operational process (by slowing enrollment) to accommodate the collection of baseline data before the intervention. Although it does not explicitly spell out how the pre-intervention data further informs cost‐effective operations, it does indicate that integrating data collection into operational planning is an aspect of their approach.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.

  **Reasoning:** This quote details a pre-intervention data collection process—the baseline survey—that was essential for maintaining the integrity of the study. The operational decision to delay token transfers, informed by the need for complete baseline data, demonstrates how pre-intervention data collection shapes operational processes that ultimately support cost-effectiveness by ensuring valid and efficient program implementation.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly conducted pre-intervention data collection (focus groups) to gather feedback on potential beneficiary targeting. This early data was used to shape the operational targeting criteria, which is a key process that can contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed appropriately. Although it doesn't directly mention cost effectiveness, improving targeting is a crucial operational process that underpins efficient and cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a key pre-intervention data collection process: by using an observable and verifiable criterion (thatched roofs) to identify economically disadvantaged households, the organization streamlines its targeting process. This targeted, data-driven identification is a fundamental operational procedure that can enhance cost-effectiveness by ensuring that resources are allocated to those most in need.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that DSW uses pre-intervention data (such as diarrhea rates, waterborne disease prevalence, and water source characteristics) to select operational areas. This data-driven approach informs the operational process by ensuring that resources are targeted to areas of highest need, which is critical for cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a specific pre-intervention activity where data is collected during a village meeting prior to installation. By assessing community response (i.e., the percentage of attendees that choose to chlorinate their water), DSW is able to adjust its operational processes and deployment strategy to enhance cost effectiveness.
