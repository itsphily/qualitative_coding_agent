**Quote:** "Earnings that I started streaming in is the biggest difference in my daily life that was brought about by the transfers. I am operating a taxi business that brings in money. I have been saving ever since it kicked off. I also improved my home by building a house and bought a solar lighting system. Recharging the solar is absolutely free and this saves money that would have gone to waste buying batteries for touches to light the houses."

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly's cash transfers have enabled recipients to start businesses and make cost-effective improvements to their homes, such as installing solar lighting systems that save money on energy costs. This supports the research question by showing how charities adjust interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** "My life is different now because of the house I was able to construct for my family. I wanted to do this for a long time to get a room for my children who are growing into their teenage. Due to a lack of money and poor income, I couldn't manage it. I can now afford to give them some privacy. I also own livestock that is high yielding when it comes to milk production."

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly's cash transfers have allowed recipients to make significant, cost-effective improvements to their living conditions and livelihoods, such as building homes and investing in high-yield livestock. This supports the research question by highlighting how charities tailor interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different contexts.


**Quote:** "My life is better in many ways since I started a taxi business. I receive a payment of my earnings every weekend and this being a regular income, is the best thing that has ever happened. I also can start a poultry keeping initiative because of the availability of money go buy the chicken needed and to feed them. I will use the savings from my taxi business to live a better life."

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly's cash transfers have enabled recipients to start businesses that provide regular income and savings, which can be reinvested into other cost-effective initiatives like poultry farming. This supports the research question by demonstrating how charities adjust interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** "Yes, because I can now afford for my family and I started my new business."

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly's cash transfers have enabled recipients to afford basic needs and start new businesses, which supports the research question by showing how charities adjust interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different contexts.


**Quote:** "Yes, because I am building my small place to live."

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly's cash transfers have allowed recipients to make cost-effective improvements to their living conditions, such as building homes.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly's cash transfers have enabled recipients to afford essential needs like food and medication, which supports the research question by demonstrating how charities adjust interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different contexts.


### Financials _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** We define efficiency as the total cash transfers committed to recipients divided by all of the funding we spend on cash transfers and the costs of delivering those cash transfers. Efficiency is the proportion of each donated dollar that ends up in the hands of recipients.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by explaining how GiveDirectly measures efficiency, which is a key aspect of cost effectiveness. It shows that the organization calibrates its operational approach by ensuring that the majority of funds reach the recipients, thus achieving cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** Assuming an average transfer size of about $1,000 per recipient, it cost about $113 to serve a recipient in our rolling one-time grant program and $128 to serve a recipient in one of our special projects.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides specific data on the cost of serving recipients in different programs, which is directly relevant to the research question. It demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness by comparing the costs of different types of interventions.


**Quote:** Over time, our organization-wide efficiency has declined modestly, but continues to be quite high. We've made two long-term decisions that have driven the decline: 1. Investing in increasing GiveDirectly's capacity to deliver more cash. 2. Implementing 'special projects' that are less efficient but are more likely to change how the aid sector operates as a whole.

**Reasoning:** This quote explains how GiveDirectly has made strategic decisions to invest in capacity and special projects, which may initially reduce efficiency but aim to achieve broader sector-wide changes. This shows how the organization calibrates its operational approaches to balance immediate cost effectiveness with long-term impact.


### Research at GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** The study explored the cost-effectiveness (impact per dollar) of unconditional cash transfers and of Gikuriro, an integrated nutrition program. It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study's primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting the size of cash transfers based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost-effectiveness. The study found that larger cash transfers were more effective in improving outcomes, indicating a tailored approach to intervention based on location-specific needs.


**Quote:** This study benchmarked the impact of a youth employment education intervention to cash transfers in the Rwandan context. It found that both programs increased productive hours, assets, savings, and subjective well-being. Only youth training improved business knowledge, and only cash transfers improved consumption, income, and wealth. When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), 'cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge'.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its interventions based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost-effectiveness. The study compared the impact of cash transfers to a youth employment education intervention, finding that cash transfers were more effective for economic outcomes, while training was better for business knowledge. This indicates a calibrated approach to intervention based on the specific needs and outcomes desired in different locations.


**Quote:** This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes ($250 to $750) on a broad range of outcome measures, for a broad range of recipients. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions in Liberia can be assessed. It will also test whether improving access to agricultural input markets increases the impact of cash transfers.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by testing different cash transfer sizes and their impact on various outcomes in Liberia. The study aims to provide a benchmark for assessing the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, indicating a tailored approach based on location-specific needs and conditions.


**Quote:** This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes to young people living in an urban environment on a broad range of outcome measures. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions targeting young people in DRC can be assessed. It will also explore the impact of varying transfer timing to inform future cash transfer program design.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its interventions based on the specifics of different locations, such as urban environments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The study evaluates the impact of different cash transfer sizes and timing, aiming to inform future program design and achieve cost-effectiveness based on location-specific needs.


### Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md

**Quote:** The transfers differ from other programs in that they are explicitly unconditional, large, and concentrated in time. We randomized at both the village and household levels; furthermore, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife versus husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer versus monthly installments), and transfer magnitude (US$404 PPP versus US$1,525 PPP).

**Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting interventions based on the specifics of different locations. The randomization of recipient gender, transfer timing, and transfer magnitude allows the charity to test and determine the most cost-effective methods for delivering unconditional cash transfers in rural Kenya.


**Quote:** We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in household monthly consumption from $158 PPP to $193 PPP nine months after the transfer began. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being. We find no overall effect on levels of the stress hormone cortisol, although there are differences across some subgroups. Monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, whereas lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables, suggesting that households face savings and credit constraints.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence on how GiveDirectly's operational adjustments (monthly vs. lump-sum transfers) lead to different outcomes, such as improved food security or increased spending on durables. These findings help the charity calibrate its interventions to achieve cost-effectiveness by understanding the trade-offs between different transfer methods.


**Quote:** The costs of the GD program at the time of the study amounted to $81 (nominal) per household. Given the proportions of large and small transfers sent at the time, this figure translates to a cost of $113 (nominal) per household for a large transfer ($1,000 nominal), that is, 11%, and $69 (nominal) for a small transfer ($300 nominal), that is, 23%. Of these costs, $50 (nominal) were fixed costs for identification and enrollment of households. Variable costs for foreign exchange and other fees were 6.3% of the transfer amount.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides explicit information on the cost structure of GiveDirectly's program, including fixed and variable costs. It highlights how the charity adjusts its operational approaches by considering the cost implications of different transfer sizes, which is crucial for achieving cost-effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** We find that indeed this is the case. Finally, we find that the treatment effects for large versus small transfers are somewhat less than proportional in most categories, suggesting decreasing returns to large transfers overall.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly evaluates the cost-effectiveness of different transfer magnitudes. The finding of decreasing returns to large transfers informs the charity's decision-making process, helping it calibrate interventions to maximize impact while minimizing costs.


**Quote:** The fact that program participation required signing up for mobile money accounts, which are a low-cost savings technology (people could have chosen to accumulate their transfer in their M-Pesa account and even add additional funds), suggests that the savings constraint at work is more social or behavioral than due purely to the lack of access to a savings technology.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly leverages low-cost technologies like mobile money accounts to enhance the cost-effectiveness of its interventions. By understanding the behavioral and social constraints on savings, the charity can better calibrate its approaches to different contexts.


**Quote:** The treatment effects on cortisol levels (Table IV) provide a tantalizing complement to this interpretation. We find that cortisol levels are significantly higher for households who receive monthly transfers than for those who receive lump-sum transfers—and in fact, significantly elevated even relative to cortisol levels for the control group.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence on the psychological impacts of different transfer methods, which is an important consideration for cost-effectiveness. By understanding how transfer timing affects stress levels, GiveDirectly can better calibrate its interventions to improve overall well-being while maintaining cost efficiency.


**Quote:** The present findings raise a number of questions for future research. First, as mentioned, the long-term effects of UCTs are topic of crucial importance for both economists and policy makers and are still incompletely understood, especially in developing countries.

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the absence of evidence regarding the long-term effects of unconditional cash transfers. This gap in knowledge is critical for understanding how charities like GiveDirectly can further calibrate their interventions to achieve sustained cost-effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** We do not study how transfers affect labor supply by children (Edmonds 2006; Edmonds and Schady 2012).

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the absence of evidence on how cash transfers affect child labor supply. This missing information is important for understanding the broader cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly's interventions, particularly in contexts where child labor is prevalent.


**Quote:** We do not address their effects on calorie consumption; this also remains a topic for future work (Deaton and Subramanian 1996).

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the absence of evidence on how cash transfers affect calorie consumption. This missing information is crucial for understanding the nutritional impact and cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly's interventions, particularly in food-insecure regions.


**Quote:** We do not study heterogeneous treatment effects of UCTs in detail; future work might investigate if they work differentially well for different target groups.

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the absence of evidence on heterogeneous treatment effects of unconditional cash transfers. Understanding how different target groups respond to interventions is essential for calibrating operational approaches to achieve cost-effectiveness in diverse contexts.


**Quote:** We do not study the equilibrium effects of cash transfers at the level of the local economy: whether UCTs lead to changes in prices, wages, and crime at the local level remains an important topic for future investigation.

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the absence of evidence on the equilibrium effects of cash transfers at the local economy level. This missing information is critical for understanding the broader economic impact and cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly's interventions in different locations.

### FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** We aim to find the poorest possible recipients while using criteria that are simple, fair, cost-effective, and difficult to game. Currently, our default is to locate extremely poor villages using poverty data from national surveys, and then enroll all households in the village. In the past we have also selected the poorer households within villages using simple criteria, e.g. enrolling families living in homes with matched roofs and not those with metal roofs, and also experimented with a wide range of other targeting approaches including community-based methods, points-based systems such as the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI) and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI); subjective assessments; and various blends of these approaches.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting interventions based on the specifics of different locations. They use poverty data from national surveys to locate extremely poor villages and enroll all households. They also experiment with various targeting approaches to ensure cost-effectiveness and fairness, adapting their methods to different contexts and criteria.


**Quote:** We consider working in additional countries only when there is a strong argument that we can increase our impact by enough to justify the fixed setup costs.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly carefully considers the cost-effectiveness of expanding to new locations. They only work in additional countries if the potential impact justifies the setup costs, indicating a calibrated approach to operational expansion based on specific location needs and cost considerations.


**Quote:** We take our relationships with local government seriously, obtaining the necessary approvals at each level from national governments down to village leaders. We also find that GiveDirectly tends to make voters happy.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by engaging with local governments and obtaining necessary approvals at various levels. This ensures that their interventions are well-received and supported by local authorities, which is crucial for achieving cost-effectiveness and successful implementation in different locations.

**Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track costs with greater granularity

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is making efforts to track costs more precisely, which is essential for calibrating operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness. By understanding costs in greater detail, the charity can adjust interventions based on the specifics of different locations to ensure resources are used efficiently.


**Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting system to track our costs with more granularity

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is enhancing its financial reporting to better understand and manage costs. This granular tracking is crucial for adjusting interventions based on location-specific factors to ensure cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** Nearly all expenses were 1:1 with a specific campaign (i.e., few fixed or shared costs)

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly's expenses are closely tied to specific campaigns, allowing for precise cost tracking. This specificity helps in calibrating operational approaches to different locations, ensuring cost effectiveness by minimizing shared or fixed costs.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** We want to better understand how you are thinking about cost-effectiveness, and how we can help

**Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by indicating a focus on understanding cost-effectiveness, which is central to how charities calibrate their operational approaches.


**Quote:** Results from ongoing studies will become available over the next 2 years, with smaller studies concluding sooner

**Reasoning:** This quote suggests that ongoing studies are being conducted to gather data on cost-effectiveness, which will inform future operational adjustments.


### Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly may eventually conduct transfers in urban areas, where targeting criteria would have to change because common housing materials differ. It may also work in northern regions of Kenya in the future, where there is no mobile money provider, so GiveDirectly staff would have to either work with branch banks to distribute cash or take armored vehicles with cash on designated distribution dates. These processes would be more expensive and higher risk, but it is something that GiveDirectly would like to build its capacity for.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly considers adjusting its operational approaches based on the specifics of different locations. In urban areas, they would need to change targeting criteria due to differing housing materials. In northern Kenya, where mobile money providers are absent, they would need to use branch banks or armored vehicles, which are more expensive and higher risk. This shows their calibration of interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different contexts.


**Quote:** Geographic diversification is one way of preparing for potential issues, because it gives GiveDirectly the flexibility to shift spending out of an area if problems arise. This is one benefit of GiveDirectly expanding to Uganda.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights GiveDirectly's strategy of geographic diversification to mitigate potential issues. By expanding to different locations like Uganda, they can shift spending if problems arise, demonstrating their approach to adjusting interventions based on location-specific challenges to maintain cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is working to grow its network in East Africa. Having allies in the countries in which it works is helpful because they can alert GiveDirectly to potential issues and help diffuse issues that arise.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly's efforts to calibrate their operational approaches by building a network of allies in East Africa. These allies can provide insights into local issues and help mitigate them, which is crucial for adjusting interventions based on location-specific factors to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** Make sure that recipients have as much privacy as possible. Currently, 70-80% of recipients answer in follow-up surveys that others in their community know when they receive payments. It may be good to bring that number down. GiveDirectly is considering giving people more control over the timing of their payments, which could help address the issue of privacy.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates GiveDirectly's consideration of adjusting their payment processes to enhance recipient privacy. By giving recipients more control over payment timing, they aim to reduce community awareness of payments, which is a location-specific adjustment to improve the effectiveness and security of their interventions.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md

**Quote:** Implemented standardized operational reporting on a weekly and monthly basis (which we will walk through together now)

Wrote automation scripts to streamline enrollment data management and generate uniform output

Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda

Transitioned previous Ug staff members into first SFO and OM role

Selected MTN as preferred provider in Uganda after assessing performance of Ezee/MTN (building relationship with Airtel so as to have an additional hedge)

**Smarter audits:** qualitative and quantitative analysis of our audit data will identify 'high-risk' recipient profiles and enable us to use a more probabilistic approach of generating audit flags (completed by end of July)

**Cost-benefit analysis:** systematic analysis of our end-to-end field model will identify ways to increase efficiency without compromising integrity/user experience (completed by end of august)

**Reasoning:** The quote provides direct evidence of how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting interventions based on the specifics of different locations. The charity has implemented standardized operational reporting, streamlined data management, procured granular census data for targeting, transitioned staff roles, selected preferred providers, and conducted smarter audits and cost-benefit analyses. These actions demonstrate a methodical approach to achieving cost-effectiveness by tailoring operations to local contexts and continuously improving processes.


**Quote:** Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria.

Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests.

Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)

Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list

Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction

All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions

In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations

Majority of households are widows, almost half have one family member that is disabled or very sick.

Households seem to be as or more needy than typical GD recipients

Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations).

May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs.

Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict.

Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.

**Reasoning:** The quote provides direct evidence of how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting interventions based on the specifics of different locations. The charity has conducted community-based targeting pilots to identify needy households that do not meet current selection criteria. The process involves individual secret ballot voting and community rankings, which are staff-intensive but necessary for clear instruction. The charity is considering additional questions to the census and supplemental community targeting, which would add costs but improve accuracy. This demonstrates a methodical approach to achieving cost-effectiveness by tailoring operations to local contexts and continuously refining processes based on pilot results.


### Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has done some non-experimental operational research in remote parts of Uganda to examine the feasibility of implementing its program in places where, e.g., there is no cell coverage, there are no local mobile money agents, villages are several hours on foot from the nearest road, etc. GiveDirectly hopes to gather information about these recipients' experiences of receiving cash transfers, withdrawing transfers, and generally test the limits of who it can get transfers to effectively.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by conducting non-experimental research in remote areas of Uganda. The research aims to understand the feasibility of implementing their program in challenging environments, such as areas without cell coverage or local mobile money agents. This information helps GiveDirectly adjust its interventions based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly expects the coffee study to help it better understand a) the overall impact of GiveDirectly's work in a Ugandan, rather than Kenyan, context, and b) whether coffee farmers make different investment choices and get different returns than people who are not coffee farmers.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by conducting a coffee study in Uganda. The study aims to understand the impact of their work in a different context (Uganda vs. Kenya) and whether coffee farmers make different investment choices compared to non-coffee farmers. This information helps GiveDirectly adjust its interventions based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly expects this study to provide new and helpful information about both a) whether supplementing cash transfers with the aspirational intervention affects recipients' spending, and b) general information on cash transfers in these Kenyan communities, which are in new areas and for which GiveDirectly will be using new, poverty-based eligibility criteria (as opposed to the specific criteria used previously in Rarieda that targeted people with grass roofs).

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by conducting an aspirations study in new Kenyan communities. The study aims to understand the impact of supplementing cash transfers with an aspirational intervention and to gather general information on cash transfers in these new areas. This helps GiveDirectly adjust its interventions based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost-effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to use campaigns in Uganda to try out new approaches to operational challenges. This is intended to allow GiveDirectly to learn more about activities it could undertake in the future. The board asked Piali Mukhopadhyay and the Uganda team to propose appropriate experimental activities, e.g. work in areas where payment infrastructure is less developed or work in humanitarian settings where the speed of payments supersedes other goals.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is experimenting with new operational approaches in Uganda to address specific challenges, such as underdeveloped payment infrastructure and the need for rapid payments in humanitarian settings. This experimentation helps them calibrate their interventions based on location-specific needs, contributing to cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** Uganda naturally presents more operational challenges than Kenya, so it makes sense to experiment with new operational approaches there. In addition, the GE study is the focus in Kenya, so GiveDirectly thinks it is better to locate its operational experimentation elsewhere.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly chooses Uganda for operational experimentation due to its inherent challenges, allowing them to test and refine approaches that can be adapted to different contexts. This location-specific experimentation helps in achieving cost-effectiveness by tailoring interventions to the unique needs of each area.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has begun discussing a pilot project in Bukedea District as part of this focus on new operational challenges. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.

**Reasoning:** The pilot project in Bukedea District involves managing cash withdrawals directly, which is a new operational approach aimed at addressing specific challenges in the area. This adjustment based on local conditions demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its interventions to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is considering expanding its eligibility criteria to include: * Vidows living in iron-roofed houses * Houses with iron roofs that are severely corroded * Households with partially cemented floors

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is adjusting its eligibility criteria based on specific housing conditions, which reflects a calibration of their operational approach to better target the most vulnerable populations in different locations. This adjustment helps in achieving cost-effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda: * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way. * Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month). * Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts. * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer. * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost effectiveness. The changes include separating roles to reduce fraud risk, increasing audits, conducting real-time checks, switching to a more reliable mobile money provider, and building a local informant network. These adjustments are tailored to the operational challenges and fraud risks identified in Uganda, showing a calibrated approach to improve cost effectiveness and program integrity.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly currently has five Senior Field Officers (SFOs) in Kenya and one in Uganda. A Field Officer in Uganda was promoted to SFO to replace the SFO involved in the fraud, and an interim SFO was brought in from Kenya to work in Uganda for one month to help the Ugandan team recover. SFOs report directly to the Field Director. There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly's process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks).

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its staffing and operational structure based on the specific needs and challenges in different locations. By promoting a local Field Officer to SFO and bringing in an interim SFO from Kenya, GiveDirectly ensures continuity and effectiveness in its operations in Uganda. This tailored approach helps maintain cost effectiveness and program integrity by addressing specific operational challenges in Uganda.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to meet with the governor of Kakamega, who is preparing to implement a $2 million Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program. There has recently been significant devolution in Kenya, and money previously controlled by the federal government has been given to county governors to allocate. This potentially creates opportunities for GiveDirectly to work with the government and offer advice on how to use these funds effectively.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by engaging with local government officials to offer advice on effective fund allocation. By collaborating with the governor of Kakamega, GiveDirectly leverages local knowledge and government structures to enhance the cost effectiveness of its interventions. This approach demonstrates a calibrated strategy to align with local governance and maximize impact.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has allocated most of its current funds towards enrolling recipients in Kenya, in order to continue implementing the rolling model for field operations and to build the sample for the general equilibrium effects study. These goals will take precedence over GiveDirectly's work in Uganda, where it expects to stop committing to new recipients in August 2014, until funds allow for additional recipients (see page 12 of GiveDirectly's written update).

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by prioritizing certain locations (Kenya over Uganda) based on the specifics of the location and the goals of the intervention (building a sample for a study). This adjustment is made to achieve cost effectiveness by focusing resources where they are most needed and can have the greatest impact.


**Quote:** Relative to Kenya, core operations make up a higher proportion of costs in Uganda because more management time has been invested in setting up GiveDirectly's operations and building the organization in Uganda.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches based on the specifics of different locations. In Uganda, more resources are allocated to setting up operations and building the organization, which increases costs. This adjustment is made to ensure that the intervention is effective and sustainable in the long term, even if it means higher initial costs.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has allocated an additional $1 million of its budget for field expenses, including transfers. This money was made available because GiveDirectly is no longer looking to hire technology staff to build field technology products, since Segovia launched. GiveDirectly may still hire technology staff to work on its website.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by reallocating funds based on changes in operational needs. The decision to allocate additional funds to field expenses instead of hiring technology staff reflects a strategic adjustment to achieve cost effectiveness by focusing on areas that directly impact the intervention's success.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has increased its detection mechanisms for adverse events in follow up surveys administered after each transfer. GiveDirectly has added a question to ask explicitly about 'domestic violence,' rather than 'violence' in general, because people may not consider the former to qualify as part of the latter.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by improving data collection methods to better understand and address adverse events. By adjusting the survey questions to explicitly ask about domestic violence, GiveDirectly ensures that it captures more accurate data, which is crucial for making informed decisions and improving the effectiveness of its interventions.

**Quote:** Verifying community's recommendations - especially in cases of disagreement between groups - is essential

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights the importance of verifying community recommendations, indicating a tailored approach to ensure accuracy and fairness in the intervention.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is considering shifting Uganda onto more of a rolling model so that both Kenya and Uganda may operate at capacity, given enough funding. However, this approach has not yet been finalized or approved by the board.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly's consideration of adjusting its operational approach in Uganda to match the rolling model used in Kenya, aiming to optimize capacity and cost-effectiveness. This directly relates to how charities calibrate their operational approaches based on location specifics.


**Quote:** Field Directors' monthly capacity for cash transfers has generally remained the same and is not expected to change in the next one to two years. GiveDirectly's current team of field officers can move about $10 million per year in cash transfers; if the number of field officers were doubled, they could handle double the amount.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational capacity based on the number of field officers, which is a key aspect of achieving cost-effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has found work like this valuable and has begun to consider having a 'floating' field director who is not assigned to any particular country, but carries out more special or conceptual work.

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates GiveDirectly's exploration of flexible operational roles to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, which is part of calibrating operational approaches to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is tracking costs related to the study and trying to determine whether the effort to change its transfer schedule based on recipient preferences would be worth the benefit to recipients.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly's methodical approach to evaluating the cost-effectiveness of adjusting transfer schedules based on recipient preferences, which is a key aspect of calibrating operational approaches.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by calibrating transfer amounts based on inflation rates in Kenya. This adjustment ensures cost-effectiveness by maintaining the real value of the transfers despite economic changes.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly's operational adjustment by testing new distribution methods and partnerships in Uganda. This approach aims to improve cost-effectiveness and efficiency in delivering cash transfers.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates GiveDirectly's methodical approach to calibrating its operational strategies by testing and comparing different eligibility metrics. This ensures that the most effective and cost-efficient methods are used to target households for cash transfers.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights GiveDirectly's operational adjustment by enhancing the distributed cashout model through better communication with recipients. This adjustment aims to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the cash transfer process.


### Carolina Toth, GiveDirectly, October 1, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** To estimate the ROI of GiveDirectly cash transfers, it is best to use a holistic approach that includes the returns from purchasing iron roofs as well as making other investments (e. g. in livestock and businesses).

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly considers multiple factors, including the purchase of iron roofs and other investments, to estimate the ROI of their cash transfers. This holistic approach helps in calibrating their operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** The benefits of iron roofs include: * Cost savings on repair and replacement of grass roofs. * Increased longevity of mud walls and floors * Cost savings on walls, as the mud used to construct walls needs to be refreshed ('smeared') less often. * Reduced travel to collect rainwater for drinking, cooking, cleaning, etc. * Possessions and food are less exposed to the elements, less likely to be spoiled by a weather event. * Mental health impacts: decreased stress about whether one's house is still standing, possessions are still intact; improved ability to sleep (especially during weather events).

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of how GiveDirectly considers the cost savings and other benefits of iron roofs, which are part of their operational approach to achieve cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** The survey data show that the costs of grass roof replacement and repair are roughly the same. This is due to the relatively uniform rate of decay for grass roofing. People with grass roofs replace them between 2 and 3 times per year.

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by providing data on the costs associated with grass roof replacement and repair, which helps in understanding the cost effectiveness of different roofing materials and interventions.


**Quote:** Based on the anonymized individual-level survey data, an iron roof costs $418 USD PPP on average, thatch roof replacement (including the cost of grass for making the roof and the labor) costs $95 USD PPP on average, and thatch roof repair (including the cost of grass for making the roof and the labor) costs $107 USD PPP on average.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of the costs associated with different types of roofs, which is crucial for understanding how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** The cost of grass roofing varies widely depending on the proximity of villages to sources of suitable grass. Costs are much higher in villages far from grass sources.

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by highlighting how the cost of grass roofing varies based on location, which is important for understanding how GiveDirectly adjusts its interventions to achieve cost effectiveness in different areas.


**Quote:** The data on the cost of iron roofs collected in the survey is reliable because the survey was conducted shortly after respondents had purchased roofing materials. The range of costs reported for iron roofs are concentrated within a narrower range than the costs for grass roofing.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of the reliability of the cost data for iron roofs, which is important for understanding how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** It would be easy to conduct a follow up survey with a much larger sample size. Such a survey may be worthwhile because questions about smearing and other costs were not included in the original survey.

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates an absence of evidence regarding certain costs (e.g., smearing) in the original survey, which is important for understanding the full scope of cost effectiveness in different locations.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly's program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly supports the research question by showing that GiveDirectly is actively working on understanding cost-effectiveness through a cost-benefit analysis. This indicates a deliberate effort to calibrate operational approaches to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a 'Thatch Plus' model that includes some additional types of households.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by changing protocols and targeting criteria. These adjustments are likely aimed at improving cost-effectiveness by optimizing the distribution process and ensuring that resources are allocated to the most appropriate households.


**Quote:** In 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusts the size of its transfers based on economic conditions like inflation. This adjustment is a strategic move to maintain the cost-effectiveness of their interventions by ensuring that the value of the transfers remains consistent over time.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on the specifics of different locations. By allocating funds to Rwanda as a contingency plan due to potential unfavorable regulations in Uganda, GiveDirectly ensures cost-effectiveness and operational flexibility.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program's purpose. In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its interventions based on local conditions. By engaging with local leaders and using accelerated schedules in high-refusal areas, GiveDirectly tailors its approach to improve acceptance and effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has found a poverty rate in Homa Bay similar to that of Siaya and Rarieda. However, more people in Homa Bay have metal roofs than in Siaya. This is likely because the grass for thatched roofs does not grow in Homa Bay, so the price of thatch is less competitive. This may mean that Homa Bay residents spend a higher percentage of their income on housing.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly considers local economic conditions and spending patterns to understand the impact of its interventions. By recognizing differences in housing expenditures, GiveDirectly can better calibrate its programs to achieve cost-effectiveness in different locations.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput
Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process

**Reasoning:** The quote demonstrates how the charity adjusts its operational approaches based on the specifics of different locations. In Kenya, the focus is on testing maximum throughput, while in Uganda, the focus is on more secure and efficient payments processes. This shows a calibration of interventions to achieve cost effectiveness based on location-specific needs.


**Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored

Modification | Potential benefit | Potential cost | Sizing implications
Eliminate 'paydays' | 1.0% efficiency gain | Higher travel costs | Minimum scale of one village (200 recipients)
Use bank (vs telco) as payments vendor | 1.3% efficiency gain | FD time required to build/manage | Likely need 1K+ recipients to make partnership
Use biometric authentication | Lower risks of certain frauds | 1.1% efficiency loss for 1.5M campaign 1 | Need 0.5K recipients for 99% chance of

**Reasoning:** This quote shows the charity's exploration of different payment protocols in Uganda to improve efficiency and security. The modifications are tailored to the specific context of Uganda, indicating a calibration of operational approaches based on location-specific challenges and opportunities.


**Quote:** Expansion outside of East Africa - overseeing >3 countries will overstretch current mgmt structure
Urban pilot -limited interest expressed by inst. donors, govt, private donors in urban
Challenging geography pilot - planning requirements and logistical challenges will overstretch current mgmt capacity
Office in non-Luo land - seeking advice from new board members on where to initiate conversations, but not actively pursuing until 2016 due to mgmt time required
Information-based pilots (health, education etc.) - Ideas42 info pilot already underway; limited evidence of bottom- up (i.e. recipients) or top-down (goverments, donors) interest in health/education-focused nudges
Non-HH (i.e. individual) transfers - will not deliver an obvious improvement in UX; field team focusing on generating non-housing based targeting criteria

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights the charity's consideration of various location-specific factors when planning interventions. It shows that the charity is aware of the limitations and challenges in different contexts and adjusts its operational approaches accordingly to ensure cost effectiveness and feasibility.


### GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly plans to use further donations to expand the reach of its current cash transfer program (which involves giving $1,000 over 2 years.) However, GiveDirectly may be open to other models, such as spreading the transfers out over a longer period of time, giving smaller amounts, or giving cash transfers to all members of a village rather than to only selected households of a larger community.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is considering adjusting its intervention models based on different scenarios and locations. They are open to spreading transfers over a longer period, giving smaller amounts, or targeting entire villages, which indicates a calibration of operational approaches to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently giving different amounts to different groups of people (ie some people receive $1,000 and others receive $300); with further funds, it would raise the level of giving to those currently receiving less.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adjusts the amount of cash transfers based on the recipients' circumstances, showing a calibration of their operational approach to ensure cost-effectiveness and impact.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly anticipates that each full-time supervisor-level staff member could process $5 million in cash transfers per year. It currently has one full-time staff member and is interviewing candidates for another full-time hire. Two full-time employees is GiveDirectly's preferred staff size at present.

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is calibrating its operational approach by adjusting staff levels to manage cash transfers efficiently, ensuring cost-effectiveness in their operations.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly gave cash transfer recipients the option of spending some of the money that they receive to buy a phone provided by GiveDirectly. Having a SIM card is needed for receiving the cash transfers. About 70% of people from the last enrollment round accepted this option.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adjusting its operational approach by offering recipients the option to buy a phone, which is necessary for receiving cash transfers. This adjustment helps ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the cash transfer process.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly mentioned that it may be possible to test peoples' preferences for cash versus goods by offering the option to receive either cash or goods in lieu of cash. GiveDirectly is interested in this possibility (but doesn't have plans in the near future to implement it.)

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is considering calibrating its operational approach by testing recipients' preferences for cash versus goods, which could lead to more cost-effective and impactful interventions.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has some interest in eventually running a randomized controlled trial of this concept at the village level. It would only use money from donors for this if the potential donors knew about GiveDirectly's plans to use their donations for the project and were more interested in funding the project than in funding GiveDirectly's other activities.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is considering calibrating its operational approach by potentially running a randomized controlled trial at the village level, which would help them understand the impact of whole-village cash transfers and adjust their interventions accordingly.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** In the Uganda scale-up, GiveDirectly selected villages based on census data at the parish level (a parish has a few villages). The data allowed GiveDirectly to identify very poor districts in Eastern Uganda, its target region. This data is not easily publicly available; GiveDirectly gained access to it with the help of a group of data scientists at Stanford who are providing pro bono support to GiveDirectly to improve its targeting methodologies.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by using location-specific data to identify very poor districts in Eastern Uganda. This demonstrates how the charity calibrates its interventions based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly would like to offer flexible timing of transfer payments as an option for recipients, and plans to evaluate the impacts of this as part of the behavioral economics study. GiveDirectly is working on its transfer automation technology to make sure it can accommodate flexible timing, and has also written a script for field staff to reduce the inevitable confusion when people are receiving transfers at different times, and when some people have a choice about timing while others do not.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is adjusting its operational approach in Kenya by offering flexible timing of transfer payments and evaluating its impact. This shows how the charity tailors its interventions based on the specifics of the location to enhance cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** In Uganda, transfers are sent in ten equal installments, and GiveDirectly works with the mobile money providers to coordinate pay out days, as their agent networks are less robust than those in Kenya. GiveDirectly expects to continue to have to coordinate pay out days, but hopes that it can move towards sending larger payments less frequently, like the Kenya model of a token transfer then two lump sums.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly adjusts its payment model in Uganda to accommodate the less robust mobile money provider networks by sending transfers in ten equal installments. This illustrates how the charity calibrates its operational approaches based on the specifics of different locations to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** The government of Uganda started a large cash transfer program called Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE), which provides $20 monthly transfers to eligible people in Uganda. The program currently serves 100,000 households in 17 districts and has plans to scale up; it is not currently active in Bukudea, where GiveDirectly operates. The government of Uganda is working with the mobile money provider MTN to build the capability to use biometric authentication (fingerprinting) for transactions and account access. GiveDirectly is interested in running a pilot of biometric authentication with its own cash transfer recipients who are serviced by MTN.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is considering a pilot of biometric authentication in Uganda, leveraging the government's efforts with MTN. This shows how the charity adjusts its operational approaches based on the specifics of the location to enhance cost effectiveness.


### Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** In the villages in GiveDirectly's two Uganda campaigns to date, about 80% of the households are eligible based on its standard criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor). In Kenya, about 35-45% of the households meet these criteria.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting targeting criteria based on the specifics of different locations. The charity uses different eligibility criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor) in Uganda and Kenya to ensure cost-effectiveness and reach the poorest households.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly said that it analyzed data on building materials and consumption in Uganda and found a similar correlation to that in Kenya, so it believes that using building materials is still an effective targeting method for reaching the poorest of the poor in Uganda.

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly uses data analysis to validate its targeting criteria across different locations. The charity ensures that its methods are effective and cost-efficient by analyzing local data and adjusting its criteria accordingly.


**Quote:** When it experimented with making transfers to all households in a village ('saturation model'), GiveDirectly did not see a major change in its costs or in the number of people 'gaming' the system by pretending to be eligible.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by testing different models (saturation model) to achieve cost-effectiveness. The charity evaluates the impact of its interventions and adjusts its strategies based on the results to ensure efficiency.


**Quote:** Forming partnerships with government officials has the benefit of expediting the government approvals process and possibly leveraging public funds. However, working with government could also politicize GiveDirectly's program. Before agreeing to a partnership, GiveDirectly would discuss elements of the program such as targeting and branding.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by forming strategic partnerships with government officials. The charity considers the benefits and risks of such partnerships to ensure cost-effectiveness and alignment with its mission.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is not interested in fully funding programs for government officials, but it is considering arrangements whereby public money would be matched by philanthropic capital.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by exploring funding arrangements that leverage public funds. The charity aims to achieve cost-effectiveness by matching philanthropic capital with public money, ensuring sustainable and impactful interventions.


### Matt_Johnson_Paul_Niehaus_06-28-17_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly's cost per dollar raised has held steady at approximately five cents, even as its revenues have grown significantly. This indicates to GiveDirectly that it is investing in the right things.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly maintains cost effectiveness even as its revenues grow. It demonstrates that the charity is able to calibrate its operational approaches to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly expects fixed cost investments to decrease its efficiency from 90% last year to between 80% and 90% this year.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches based on funding fluctuations. It shows that the charity is aware of the impact of fixed costs on efficiency and is calibrating its operations to maintain cost effectiveness.


### Matt_Johnson_02-27-17_(public).md

**Quote:** Matt Johnson (Chief Marketing Officer) leads the fundraising team and manages partnership work (i.e. relationships with large donors)

**Reasoning:** This quote directly supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by adjusting its fundraising team to build relationships with large donors, which is crucial for achieving cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has two main fundraising goals: 1. Maximizing the revenue that it can distribute to the poor in the short term. The most efficient way to do this is by building relationships with foundations, institutions, and high-net-worth individual donors. GiveDirectly's current priority is to hire more staff who can focus on building partnerships with large donors to achieve this goal. 2. Building a base of small donors so that in the long term, revenue is more predictable and less reliant on a small number of large donations.

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by illustrating how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach to achieve cost effectiveness through specific fundraising goals, including building relationships with large donors and creating a base of small donors.


**Quote:** Mr. Johnson is working on building a strong marketing team to build digital tools, refresh its website, and do digital marketing to achieve this goal. This work includes two main priorities: 1. Creating more and better digital tools to enable GiveDirectly's small donors to influence their networks to critically evaluate how GiveDirectly's work compares to other poverty interventions. 2. Creating more and better content (such as op eds, videos, and infographics) on topics such as cash transfers, basic income, the charity ecosystem, and GiveDirectly's new refugee work.

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by developing digital tools and content to engage small donors, which is part of their strategy to achieve cost effectiveness.


### Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly did not used to do a census of the whole village before registering eligible households. The census was added so that GiveDirectly could have a full picture of the village, not miss any households, and would be better able to track households that were shifting around. Also, without a census documenting information about each household, it is more likely that word would spread about households being registered and other households would try to pose as eligible when they were first visited.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusted its operational approach by adding a census stage to better understand the village demographics and ensure accurate targeting of eligible households. This adjustment helps in achieving cost effectiveness by reducing errors and ensuring that resources are allocated to the intended recipients.


**Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly experimented with a community-based targeting process, whereby residents gave input on households that they felt were deserving of transfers but had been excluded by GiveDirectly's criteria. GiveDirectly felt that to do this process well required significant resources (staff time) and that the benefits were not worth the costs. In addition, some of the villages involved in this experiment gave feedback that they would prefer for GiveDirectly to make the decisions about targeting.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly experimented with a community-based targeting process but decided against it due to the high resource requirements and feedback from villages. This decision reflects a calibration of their operational approach to balance cost effectiveness with community input.


**Quote:** The logistics are significantly harder in Uganda than in Kenya. For example, when GiveDirectly enters a new village in Uganda, over 90% of recipients need SIM cards because they did not previously have cell phones, and about 70-80% of recipients need national IDs. GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach in Uganda by coordinating registration drives for national IDs and SIM cards, which are necessary for the mobile money transfers. This adjustment ensures that the intervention is feasible and cost-effective in the Ugandan context.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md

**Quote:** We are considering experimenting with a few aspects of our transfer model: * _Frequency of payments._ The preliminary results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a GiveDirectly campaign have suggested very slight differences between lump-sum and stream payments. Some recipients of GiveDirectly cash transfers report that they would prefer lump sum payments, while others report that they'd prefer stream payments. There may be a benefit in giving recipients the ability to choose the frequency of their payments. * _Messaging to recipients._ One of the difficulties of running a cash transfer program is ensuring that all recipients are given a consistent and accurate message about the program. Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached. Once GiveDirectly is confident that its field staff are delivering a consistent message, it may be interested in varying that message to emphasize different elements, such as encouraging long-term investments versus not giving any advice on how funds should be spent. * _Providing information on how other people have used funds._ The most popular use of funds in past transfers has been purchasing metal roofs. It's possible this is because it is the most beneficial use of funds, but its also possible that recipients purchase roofs because that is the social norm. It would be interesting to see if providing information about how other people have used funds creatively (e.g., to purchase a motorcycle) influences the way recipients spend funds.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is experimenting with different operational approaches to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their cash transfer programs. They are considering varying the frequency of payments, improving messaging to recipients, and providing information on how others have used funds. These adjustments are aimed at enhancing recipient experience and ensuring the program's integrity and efficiency.


**Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation. GiveDirectly is pursuing both structural and operational questions for future research. While we want to maximize our experimentation and testing, any additional steps we add increase the complexity of the operations that our staff have to manage, so that is a consideration.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly acknowledges the importance of experimenting with operational procedures to improve efficiency, integrity, and recipient experience. They are considering new systems like field staff compensation to enhance these aspects. However, they also note that increasing experimentation adds complexity to operations, which is a key consideration in their approach.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** We have made several changes to our field process under current $2M campaign in Kenya

* **Village saturation:** Randomized selection of 18 villages to apply saturation approach (with same size group for thatch and control)
* **Staff incentives:** Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * **Census:** Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * **Enrollment:** Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * **Back check:** Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered

**Reasoning:** The quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting interventions based on the specifics of different locations. The charity uses a randomized selection of villages for saturation and implements staff incentives based on performance metrics, which are tailored to the local context to achieve cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has implemented a 'rolling model' in Kenya that enables all three steps of enrollment to occur simultaneously in different villages. Field staff now work continuously, year-round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before.

**Reasoning:** The rolling model allows GiveDirectly to adjust its operational approach by enabling continuous, year-round enrollment in different villages, which increases efficiency and cost-effectiveness by maintaining a steady workflow and reducing downtime between campaigns.


**Quote:** Segovia is developing an end-to-end digital data management system for GiveDirectly's operations. Currently, field data is collected digitally using smartphones and payments are sent digitally using mobile money systems, but the steps in between require manual exporting and processing of data. GiveDirectly said that the Segovia product will fully automate the data management from enrollment to payment.

**Reasoning:** The development of the Segovia product represents a significant technological improvement that will automate data management processes, leading to increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness by reducing manual labor and potential errors in data handling.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly told us that it is not aware of any such issues so far, and it feels confident in its field staff managers, who have shown a high degree of commitment and have been working with GiveDirectly for a long time, and in its methods of process and data control.

**Reasoning:** Effective staff management ensures that field staff are committed and experienced, which contributes to the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the charity's operations by maintaining high standards of data control and process integrity.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly expects to complete enrollment for the second campaign in August, after which point it will pause its enrollment of new recipients in Uganda. GiveDirectly told us that this has been its plan since before starting to make the second round of transfers.

**Reasoning:** Pausing enrollment in Uganda allows GiveDirectly to focus resources on completing follow-up activities and building organizational structure, which enhances the cost-effectiveness of future campaigns by ensuring a solid operational foundation.


### GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly selected a region of the country to set up initial operations in based on poverty data. GiveDirectly has sent us the data that it relied on to target this region, which we plan to review and incorporate into a future update.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by selecting regions for operations based on poverty data, ensuring that interventions are targeted effectively to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to work with two different mobile money services in the second country. Initially, it was only planning to work with one mobile money service, but decided to run a dual-provider pilot after identifying a promising new company providing electronic transfers linked to, but not dependent on, mobile phones. It determined this could be valuable given concerns about poor cell phone network coverage in the targeted geography and limitations with the other mobile money service's customer service.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by choosing to work with two different mobile money services to address specific challenges in the targeted geography, such as poor cell phone network coverage and customer service limitations, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** In response, GiveDirectly has been more proactive in coordinating with the mobile money service for the transfers that have begun, for example, by giving the mobile money service advanced notice before sending the funds so that agents could be prepared. In some cases, agents traveled to the villages in which recipients live to reduce recipient travel time.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by proactively coordinating with mobile money services to ensure smooth transfers, including giving advanced notice and arranging for agents to travel to villages, which reduces recipient travel time and enhances cost effectiveness.


### Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has often found the 'payday' payment model too restrictive. In its Uganda program, it has successfully tested a 'cash-out' model. Recipients and agents were able to overcome liquidity constraints, and in Uganda, GiveDirectly distributes $700,000 to $1 million per month without any increases in fraud.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on the specifics of different locations. In Uganda, they tested and implemented a 'cash-out' model to overcome liquidity constraints, which shows their ability to calibrate interventions for cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.


**Quote:** In early 2016, GiveDirectly allocated a fairly large sum of money to test a new implementation model in Kenya. A separate field director and team were hired approximately six months ago, and the experiment is taking place in an area close to GiveDirectly's other field operations. The primary aim is to double the program's size in 2017 without significantly increasing the management structure. The new model seeks to increase throughput per manager by eliminating the token payment and back check steps.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates GiveDirectly's approach to operational calibration by testing a new implementation model in Kenya. The aim is to increase program size and efficiency without significantly increasing management costs, showing their focus on cost-effectiveness and adaptability to different operational contexts.


**Quote:** In two of its experimental campaigns (the experiment to increase throughput in Kenya and its work in a coffee farming community), GiveDirectly is experimenting with a 'wave' approach. In this scenario, the same officers perform multiple steps; however, for steps intended to provide a check on previous steps, officers do not perform multiple steps in the same village. This ensures that the same field officer does not visit a household twice during the enrollment process.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly's operational calibration by experimenting with a 'wave' approach in Kenya and a coffee farming community. This approach aims to increase efficiency and reduce costs by having the same officers perform multiple steps, while maintaining checks to ensure quality and prevent fraud.


### Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md

**Quote:** Collaborating with governments on cash transfers can be challenging because governments often give preference to organizations that have been operating in the area for a long time. Offering matching funds can make it more appealing for governments to collaborate with new partners. GiveDirectly's operational expertise is particularly valuable in its work with governments.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by offering matching funds to make collaborations with governments more appealing. This strategy helps in achieving cost-effectiveness by leveraging operational expertise and making partnerships more feasible.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly could use more funds to start cash transfer programs that it would intend to pass to governments once the value of the programs had been demonstrated. For example, GiveDirectly could offer several million dollars and early management assistance to encourage a government to try cash transfers. Such a program would be donor-funded while new systems were being put in place and while operational problems were being solved; then, if the program were successful, GiveDirectly could pass it to the government.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by starting aid programs with the intention of passing them to governments once proven successful. This method ensures cost-effectiveness by initially funding and managing the programs, then transitioning them to government control after demonstrating their value.


**Quote:** With more funding, GiveDirectly could conduct additional experiments aimed at influencing policy and building relationships with governments and aid organizations. Attendees at a recent social protection conference in Kenya were interested in the link between variation in transfer size and the effectiveness of cash transfers. GiveDirectly could use additional funding to study this issue.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by conducting experiments to influence policy and build relationships. By studying the link between transfer size and effectiveness, GiveDirectly can achieve cost-effectiveness by optimizing its cash transfer programs based on empirical evidence.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly plans to spend $12.6 million in Kenya this year. The target number of enrollments varies by month: enrollments will speed up significantly at the beginning of the year, then be cut back after June.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on the specifics of the location (Kenya) by varying the number of enrollments throughout the year to achieve cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** A single campaign (not a rolling campaign) is planned in Uganda, as a 'payments pilot'. This will be designed to learn about the different payment systems that could be used for transfers; the focus on learning about payments will slow the program down.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach in Uganda by conducting a payments pilot to learn about different payment systems, which is a specific adjustment based on the location's needs and context.


**Quote:** If GiveDirectly were to receive additional retail donations on the order of $1-3 million from retail donors, the board would likely allocate the donations to transfers in Kenya. GiveDirectly still plans to scale up in Kenya and wants to retain its staff there.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its funding allocation based on the specifics of the location (Kenya) to ensure cost effectiveness and retain staff, which is crucial for operational success.


**Quote:** The easiest way for GiveDirectly to increase its capacity to carry out transfers would be to hire more Field Officers (FOs). This could be done first in Kenya, then in Uganda after the program to test different payment methods has been completed.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational capacity by hiring more Field Officers in specific locations (Kenya and Uganda) based on the needs and progress of their programs, ensuring cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** Deployment of the Segovia system in Kenya is ongoing in parallel with development; new features are incorporated and bugs are worked out in the field, in real time. GiveDirectly plans to begin using Segovia in Uganda at some point in 2015, although an exact date has not been chosen.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by deploying the Segovia system in different locations (Kenya and Uganda) and incorporating real-time feedback to improve the system, ensuring cost effectiveness.


**Quote:** Several metrics are being tracked to determine what difference Segovia has made to GiveDirectly's operations. One important metric is the time saved by FDs; FDs are informally keeping track of these timesavings and how they are using their increased capacity.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by tracking metrics related to the Segovia system to assess its impact on efficiency and cost effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** The ongoing study on the general equilibrium effects of direct cash transfers is expected to finish collecting baseline data around the middle of 2015. Endline data will be gathered approximately one year after baseline. A long-term follow-up is also planned, but when exactly this will take place has not been finalized.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by conducting studies to understand the broader impacts of cash transfers, which helps in calibrating interventions for cost effectiveness in different locations.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by focusing on existing locations rather than expanding to new countries. The charity believes it is more cost-effective to serve more of the extreme poor in the countries where it already operates, rather than incurring the additional costs of setting up operations in new countries. This decision is based on the specifics of the locations and the cost-effectiveness of their interventions.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on the specifics of the location. In Rwanda, the charity has increased its capacity and coordinated closely with the president's office due to the tight regulation of NGOs. This demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its interventions to the local context to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint. Starting and scaling up projects in 4 new countries at once would be a significant challenge.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by balancing the speed of new project implementation with the ease of management. The charity recognizes that starting and scaling up projects in multiple new countries simultaneously would be challenging, so it opts for a sequential rollout. This approach is tailored to the specifics of the locations and the charity's capacity, ensuring cost-effectiveness.


### Summary_2018.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly selects beneficiaries using one of two methods. In some locations, it selects villages with high poverty levels and distributes cash transfers to all households in those villages (the 'village saturation' model). In other locations, it selects villages with high poverty levels and distributes cash transfers to the households in those villages that it identifies as meeting a threshold for being among the poorest (the 'household targeting' model).

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach based on the specifics of different locations. The charity uses two distinct models—village saturation and household targeting—to ensure cost-effectiveness and appropriate targeting of resources. This adjustment based on local conditions directly supports the research question about how charities adjust interventions to achieve cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly's typical process is as follows: 1. Local area selection: Select local region and then villages based largely on poverty rates. 2. Census: Conduct a census of all households in each village. 3. Registration: Send a separate team to register eligible households. This includes a) helping recipients set up a payment system to receive transfers (if they don't already have such a system in place), and b) collecting an additional round of data from the household that can be checked against the initial data from the census. 4. Audit: Some households are flagged for audit based on discrepancies collected in the previous steps and are revisited to collect additional data. 5. Transfers sent: GiveDirectly sends transfers to recipients via mobile money providers. 6. Follow-up calls: GiveDirectly field staff make multiple phone calls to all recipients as transfers are being sent to ask various questions about recipients' experiences.

**Reasoning:** This quote outlines the detailed operational process GiveDirectly follows to ensure cost-effectiveness and proper targeting of resources. The process includes local area selection, census, registration, audit, transfers, and follow-up calls, all of which are adjusted based on the specifics of different locations. This demonstrates how the charity calibrates its approach to achieve cost-effectiveness, directly addressing the research question.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has told us that policymakers, academics, and others have shown an increased interest in universal basic income experiments and GiveDirectly believes the project could have significant policy impact. We and GiveDirectly believe that the direct impact of the program (excluding any potential policy impact) is likely to be less cost-effective than GiveDirectly's standard campaign.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly considers the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, such as universal basic income experiments, compared to its standard cash transfer campaigns. The charity evaluates the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of various approaches, demonstrating how it calibrates its operational strategies based on the specifics of different interventions and locations.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has partnered with a number of institutional partners and foundations to implement cash transfers to populations of specific interest to those funders. GiveDirectly is matching funding with USAID to deliver cash transfers and run studies on its impact in Rwanda, Liberia, Malawi, and DRC.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by partnering with institutional funders like USAID to deliver cash transfers and conduct impact studies in specific countries. These partnerships allow the charity to tailor its interventions to the needs and priorities of different locations, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness and addressing the research question.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly's goals for experimentation include increasing the evidence base for cash transfers, improving recipient returns and welfare (both in GiveDirectly's program and others), and developing capabilities necessary to implement larger-scale programs or programs in new contexts.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach by conducting experiments to improve the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of its programs. The charity aims to build evidence, enhance recipient welfare, and develop capabilities for scaling up or adapting to new contexts, which directly supports the research question about adjusting interventions for cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has told us that most potential recipients in Homa Bay County already have iron roofs. Additionally, Rwanda recently banned thatched roofs, so recipients are more likely to already have iron roofs there. To date, our estimate of investment returns from GiveDirectly's cash transfers has been based on the return to buying an iron roof (due to this being a particularly common purchase). The fact that iron roofs are already common in Homa Bay and Rwanda raises questions about how recipients will spend transfers and what returns on their investments they will get.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly considers local conditions, such as the prevalence of iron roofs in Homa Bay and Rwanda, to calibrate its operational approach. The charity evaluates how these local specifics might affect the cost-effectiveness of its interventions, directly addressing the research question about adjusting approaches based on location-specific factors.

### Supplementary Information_2018.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly told us that it adjusts its transfer sizes for purchasing power; as of 2018, in Kenya, GiveDirectly transferred approximately $1,085 to each enrolled household, while in Uganda, it transferred approximately $963 and in Rwanda $970.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by adjusting the size of cash transfers based on the purchasing power in different locations. This adjustment is a direct response to the economic conditions of each country, ensuring cost-effectiveness and appropriateness of the intervention.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly considers poverty data, population density, logistical and security factors, and the presence of other poverty-focused NGOs when it selects a district or county to work in.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by considering various local factors such as poverty data, population density, and logistical challenges when selecting regions for intervention. This ensures that the interventions are tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each location, enhancing cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** In early 2015, when selecting sub-counties and sub-locations in Kenya, GiveDirectly considered poverty data, the number of potentially eligible households, how easily it could transfer staff capacity to the new locations, and how rural each area was.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approaches by considering specific local factors such as poverty data, the number of eligible households, and the rural nature of areas when selecting sub-counties and sub-locations in Kenya. This ensures that the interventions are well-suited to the local context, thereby improving cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** GiveDirectly has told us that if it is benchmarking cash against a program that distributes food stamps, GiveDirectly might disburse smaller and more frequent payments (which recipients are more likely to spend on food) to make the programs more comparable.

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approaches by modifying the size and frequency of payments based on the type of program it is benchmarking against. This calibration ensures that the cash transfer program is comparable and effective in achieving its goals, thus enhancing cost-effectiveness.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md

**Quote:** Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, and cash transfers are in the same range of cost-effectiveness of other priority programs we have considered.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the cost-effectiveness of cash transfer programs, which is a key aspect of how charities calibrate their operational approaches to achieve cost-effectiveness. It highlights the sensitivity of cost-effectiveness calculations to various assumptions, indicating that charities must carefully consider these factors when adjusting interventions based on location specifics.


**Quote:** We estimate that cash transfer programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that cash transfer programs, such as those run by GiveDirectly, are considered to be cost-effective compared to other priority programs. This supports the idea that charities can achieve cost-effectiveness by carefully calibrating their interventions based on the specifics of different locations.


**Quote:** In practice, these calculations are sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding: the investment returns to cash transfers; the subjective assessment of the relative value of averting child mortality and improving incomes for adults.

**Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes the importance of assumptions in cost-effectiveness calculations, particularly regarding investment returns and the value of different outcomes. This indicates that charities must carefully consider these factors when adjusting their interventions to achieve cost-effectiveness in different locations.


### Site visit_2012.md

**Quote:** DSW breaks down the direct implementation costs into 2 buckets: 1. Initial implementation (from the decision to install dispensers through the installation, including materials, community education, transportation, staff time, etc.) costs $200/chlorine dispenser; this will go down over time. 2. Ongoing operations (ensuring that the dispensers continue to function and increasing the rate at which they are used) are projected to cost $65/dispenser/year at scale. This includes chlorine supply, maintenance, hardware replacement after its projected lifespan, M&E, management costs and all overheads.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how DSW calibrates its operational approaches by breaking down costs into initial implementation and ongoing operations. This cost structure allows DSW to adjust its interventions based on the specifics of different locations, ensuring cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%, and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that DSW adjusts its interventions based on the outcomes of different pilots and studies. By scaling up the most promising approaches and continuing to test new ones, DSW ensures that its operational approaches are calibrated for cost-effectiveness in different locations.


**Quote:** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how DSW calibrates its operational approaches by setting specific criteria for placing chlorine dispensers. These criteria ensure that the dispensers are installed in locations where they will be most effective, contributing to cost-effectiveness.


**Quote:** DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that DSW is continuously experimenting with different incentive models for promoters to increase the uptake of chlorine dispensers. By adjusting these incentives based on the specifics of different locations, DSW ensures that its operational approaches are cost-effective.

**Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on the specifics of the location (Uganda) to achieve cost-effectiveness. By organizing cash out days near the villages, they address the lack of robust agent networks and liquidity, thereby reducing transportation costs for recipients and ensuring efficient fund distribution.


**Quote:** Mr. Skeates noted that far fewer people were withdrawing cash at this cash out day than he had expected. In total, we estimated that about 40 people withdrew cash at the event, while 380 people across two villages had received transfers. Mr. Skeates asked an English-speaking village member about this, who said that many people traveled to an adjacent district to withdraw cash from an MTN agent there, because the big market day in their area is on Monday, and the cash out day was happening on a Tuesday.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach based on local market days and recipient behavior. By understanding that many recipients preferred to withdraw cash on market days, GiveDirectly can better plan future cash out days to align with local schedules, thereby improving cost-effectiveness and recipient convenience.
