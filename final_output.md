# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.

## GiveDirectly

### Research at GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its delivery approach—an operational process—by using mobile money to address the specific challenges of reaching very remote communities. By adapting the intervention to the local characteristic (remoteness), the process is able to deliver cash transfers efficiently, which is a critical factor in achieving cost effectiveness. This directly supports the research question on how location-specific operational adjustments contribute to cost effectiveness.


### Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md

**Quote:** “At the time of the study, eligibility was determined by living in a house with a thatched (rather than metal) roof. Such households were identified through a census conducted with the help of the village elder.”

“The costs of the GD program at the time of the study amounted to $81 (nominal) per household.”

**Reasoning:** The first quote directly illustrates an operational process that tailors the intervention to local characteristics – in this case, using a locally relevant proxy (thatched versus metal roofs) and leveraging the local village elder to identify eligible households. This process uses an easily observable, context‐specific indicator of poverty, thereby reducing complexity and administrative expenses. The second quote provides evidence of the low per‐household cost, implying that such location‐sensitive procedures help achieve cost effectiveness. Together, these quotes show that by adjusting processes according to local attributes, the intervention keeps targeting precise and operational costs low.


### FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** No. In order to be as fair to all as possible, we select recipients using a systematic and proactive set of criteria that vary from country to country, and do not accept inbound applications. We aim to find the poorest possible recipients while using criteria that are simple, fair, cost-effective, and difficult to game. We consider working in additional countries only when there is a strong argument that we can increase our impact by enough to justify the fixed setup costs.

**Reasoning:** The first quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusts its selection criteria based on country-specific conditions, demonstrating that their operational process is tailored to local characteristics. The second quote reinforces this by explicitly requiring that the criteria be 'cost-effective', directly linking tailored processes to achieving cost effectiveness. The third quote illustrates that the decision to operate in a new location considers fixed setup costs relative to potential impact, which is a key component of cost-effective intervention design.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Kenya rolling campaign increased speed, with smaller campaigns driving learning in both Kenya and Uganda. Smaller 'design lab' projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow.

**Reasoning:** The first sentence indicates that the charity deploys a different operational style in Kenya and Uganda, using both a larger rolling campaign and smaller, localized campaigns that foster ongoing learning. The second sentence shows that these 'design lab' projects are integrated into the operational flow, suggesting that the intervention is adapted according to the specific characteristics of each location. Together, they imply that such tailored and flexible operational processes are used to optimize resource use and intervention strategies, which is likely intended to enhance cost effectiveness.


### Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly may eventually conduct transfers in urban areas, where targeting criteria would have to change because common housing materials differ. It may also work in northern regions of Kenya in the future, where there is no mobile money provider, so GiveDirectly staff would have to either work with branch banks to distribute cash or take armored vehicles with cash on designated distribution dates. These processes would be more expensive and higher risk, but it is something that GiveDirectly would like to build its capacity for.

**Reasoning:** These quotes provide direct evidence that GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes to the unique characteristics of each location. In urban areas, the intervention is adapted by revising targeting criteria based on local housing materials, and in regions without a mobile money provider, alternative methods (using branch banks or armored vehicles) are considered. Adjusting the intervention in this way is intended to match local conditions and challenges, thereby optimizing resource use and enhancing potential cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md

**Quote:** Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda

**Reasoning:** This quote supports the research question by showing that the organization tailors its operational process to the specific administrative and demographic characteristics of each location. By using sublocation-level data in Kenya and parish-level data in Uganda, the charity adjusts its targeting methods to the local context, which is likely to contribute to cost effectiveness by enabling more precise and efficient allocation of resources.


### Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has done some non-experimental operational research in remote parts of Uganda to examine the feasibility of implementing its program in places where, e.g., there is no cell coverage, there are no local mobile money agents, villages are several hours on foot from the nearest road, etc. GiveDirectly hopes to gather information about these recipients' experiences of receiving cash transfers, withdrawing transfers, and generally test the limits of who it can get transfers to effectively.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is adapting its operational processes based on unique local characteristics—in this case, remote Ugandan villages with challenges such as lack of cell coverage or local mobile money agents. By tailoring processes to these conditions, the charity can better ensure that its interventions are delivered effectively, which in turn contributes to overall cost effectiveness by testing and refining delivery methods in challenging contexts.


### GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to use campaigns in Uganda to try out new approaches to operational challenges. Uganda naturally presents more operational challenges than Kenya, so it makes sense to experiment with new operational approaches there. In addition, the GE study is the focus in Kenya, so GiveDirectly thinks it is better to locate its operational experimentation elsewhere. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.

**Reasoning:** These quotes demonstrate that GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes to the specific challenges posed by different locations. In Uganda, where operational challenges are greater, the organization experiments with new approaches—including rethinking the cash withdrawal process—to better address local realities. This localized adjustment of processes is intended to optimize efficiency and could contribute to achieving cost effectiveness by reducing unnecessary expenditures and streamlining operations according to each context's needs.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.

**Reasoning:** The first quote shows an operational adjustment where GiveDirectly selects a mobile money provider (MTN) based on the local network characteristics, ensuring that recipients have more withdrawal options. This decision likely contributes to cost effectiveness by reducing logistical constraints and inefficiencies. The second quote compares the efficiency of programs in different countries, implying that tailoring operational processes to the specific conditions of each location (e.g., streamlined procedures in Kenya) leads to better overall efficiency and cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md

**Quote:** Relative to Kenya, core operations make up a higher proportion of costs in Uganda because more management time has been invested in setting up GiveDirectly's operations and building the organization in Uganda.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes based on local characteristics—in this case, the difference between Kenya and Uganda. The fact that more management time (and thus higher operational costs) is required in Uganda suggests that tailoring operations to account for local conditions is a key factor, impacting the cost structure of the intervention. This supports the research question by highlighting how location-specific adjustments can drive differences in cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md

**Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly's team is working at a rate of about $10 million per year. In Uganda, GiveDirectly's current campaign is disbursing $2 million; the model of rolling enrollment, which GiveDirectly uses in Kenya, has not been adopted in Uganda yet.

GiveDirectly is considering shifting Uganda onto more of a rolling model so that both Kenya and Uganda may operate at capacity, given enough funding. However, this approach has not yet been finalized or approved by the board.

Under GiveDirectly's rolling model (as in Kenya), a field director may update the database daily, as each team needs data from it and may be carrying out activities in quick succession. In Uganda, the database requires updates only about twice a week.

Version 2.0 of Segovia, which has fewer bugs, saves an estimated 30 minutes of Field Directors' work on each update in Uganda, for a weekly time savings of about one hour. In Kenya, where GiveDirectly is still operating on the original version but will be switching to 2.0 soon, the weekly time savings will be greater because the database is updated daily.

**Reasoning:** These quotes demonstrate that GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes based on the specific characteristics of each location. The first set of quotes highlights that Kenya’s use of a rolling enrollment model allows its team to work at a higher capacity compared to Uganda, where this model is not yet in use. The consideration of shifting Uganda to a rolling model underscores an effort to align interventions with local operational demands, which can promote efficiency and cost effectiveness. Additionally, the discussion about the frequency of database updates and the time savings from Segovia Version 2.0 shows that operational adjustments—such as updating data daily in fast-paced environments versus less frequently in slower ones—can reduce manual workload and lead to cost savings. Together, these operational adjustments tailored to local conditions contribute to achieving greater cost effectiveness by optimizing resource use and efficiency in each context.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Quote:** “The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.”

“The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.”

**Reasoning:** The first quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its eligibility criteria based on local characteristics—in this case, substituting the thatch proxy in areas like Homa Bay County where it isn’t a suitable indicator—to ensure that resources are accurately targeted. This tailored approach supports cost effectiveness by reducing misallocation of funds. The second quote illustrates an operational process that incorporates local cost considerations through budgeting and efficiency target setting. By calibrating efficiency metrics based on individual country conditions, GiveDirectly aligns its interventions with local economic realities, thereby maintaining high cost-effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a 'Thatch Plus' model that includes some additional types of households.

One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.

**Reasoning:** The first quote demonstrates an operational adjustment in the intervention—by changing protocols (such as adopting a cash out day led by GiveDirectly and switching to a 'Thatch Plus' targeting model) the organization tailors its criteria, likely reflecting local housing or community characteristics. Such tailoring can improve the efficiency of targeting, hence contributing to cost effectiveness. The second quote shows a location-specific operational response when faced with unusually high levels of gaming in one Kenyan village. By pausing transfers and engaging the community to gather more information, GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention to local conditions in order to prevent misallocation of funds, which is a process likely to enhance overall cost effectiveness.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput. Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that the charity is deliberately modifying its operational processes based on the specific characteristics of each location. In Kenya, the focus is on maximizing throughput, while in Uganda the focus shifts to securing and streamlining payments. The efficiency percentages provided (91% in Kenya and 86% in Uganda) indicate that these tailored approaches are designed to improve cost effectiveness by addressing local operational challenges.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** In the Kenya 1.2M campaign, villages were selected based on the proportion of match to iron roofs, which was manually estimated using satellite imagery. In the Kenya scale-up, GiveDirectly used a machine learning algorithm that estimates the proportion of match to iron roofs in a village using satellite imagery.

In the Uganda scale-up, GiveDirectly selected villages based on census data at the parish level (a parish has a few villages). The data allowed GiveDirectly to identify very poor districts in Eastern Uganda, its target region.

GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty.

**Reasoning:** Each of these quotes demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes to the specific characteristics of each location. The first quote shows that in Kenya, the organization uses local data—via satellite imagery and machine learning—to select villages based on roof materials, a proxy for wealth. The second quote illustrates that in Uganda, census data is used to identify very poor districts, ensuring that the intervention reaches the most needy regions. The third quote highlights the incorporation of community input into targeting methods. These tailored approaches can contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed where they have the greatest impact, minimizing unnecessary expenditures and improving overall efficiency.


### Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** “In the villages in GiveDirectly's two Uganda campaigns to date, about 80% of the households are eligible based on its standard criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor). In Kenya, about 35-45% of the households meet these criteria.”

“GiveDirectly said that it analyzed data on building materials and consumption in Uganda and found a similar correlation to that in Kenya, so it believes that using building materials is still an effective targeting method for reaching the poorest of the poor in Uganda.”

“GiveDirectly said that in Kenya it is important to maintain relationships with government officials at the county and district levels; district commissioners introduce GiveDirectly to chiefs, and chiefs introduce GiveDirectly to village elders. In Uganda, there are no counties, so GiveDirectly coordinates with a few people at the district level to acquire approvals, and from there connect with officials at the local level.”

**Reasoning:** The first two quotes show that GiveDirectly adjusts its targeting process to account for local characteristics. By analyzing local building material data, they tailor their eligibility criteria to each country’s context, which implies an operational method designed to allocate resources efficiently—thereby contributing to cost effectiveness. The third quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly customizes its approval and networking processes based on the administrative structures of each location (Kenya’s counties versus Uganda’s district system). This tailored approach likely minimizes delays and reduces resource expenditure, further enhancing cost effectiveness. Together, these quotes provide direct evidence that adapting operational processes to local conditions is key to maintaining efficient, cost-effective interventions.


### Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** The logistics are significantly harder in Uganda than in Kenya. For example, when GiveDirectly enters a new village in Uganda, over 90% of recipients need SIM cards because they did not previously have cell phones, and about 70-80% of recipients need national IDs. GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households.

In Kenya, GiveDirectly experimented with a community-based targeting process, whereby residents gave input on households that they felt were deserving of transfers but had been excluded by GiveDirectly's criteria. GiveDirectly felt that to do this process well required significant resources (staff time) and that the benefits were not worth the costs.

**Reasoning:** The first quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational process to meet local needs—tailoring activities such as national ID registration due to Uganda-specific challenges (lack of SIM cards and IDs). This adaptation likely improves efficiency by streamlining the registration process, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness. The second quote offers direct evidence of a location-specific intervention (community-based targeting in Kenya) that was tested but ultimately rejected because its extra resource requirements outweighed the benefits. Together, these quotes illustrate how adjusting operational processes to local characteristics can have direct implications for achieving, or in one case, failing to achieve cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** We have made several changes to our field process under current $2M campaign in Kenya. Village saturation: Randomized selection of 18 villages to apply saturation approach (with same size group for thatch and control). Staff incentives: Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: Census: Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) Enrollment: Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) Back check: Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of operational processes being adjusted in the field based on local characteristics. The use of a 'village saturation' approach indicates that interventions are tailored at the village level, and the implementation of 'staff incentives' based on localized, specific performance metrics (such as census accuracy and enrollment quality) demonstrates efforts to optimize operations. These localized adjustments are intended to improve efficiency, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md

**Quote:** “GiveDirectly has implemented a 'rolling model' in Kenya that enables all three steps of enrollment to occur simultaneously in different villages. Field staff now work continuously, year‐round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before.”

“GiveDirectly said that it decided to conduct a second campaign this year, despite knowing that it would end up pausing enrollment afterwards, to take advantage of its presence in Uganda to build out the organizational structure and operations there, which were not as formally established as those in Kenya.”

“One reason to pause new enrollments in Uganda is for GiveDirectly to direct all transfers to Kenya to increase the sample size for this study.”

**Reasoning:** The first quote shows Kenya’s tailored operational process—a continuous, rolling model that leverages the local context to streamline enrollment, potentially reducing overhead and bolstering efficiency (key aspects of cost effectiveness). The following quotes about Uganda illustrate an adjustment based on local characteristics: because Uganda’s organizational infrastructure is not as established, GiveDirectly opts for a short-term campaign followed by pausing further enrollments, thereby reallocating resources to Kenya where operations are more mature. Together these quotes support the research question by highlighting how adapting intervention strategies to specific local conditions (continuous operation in Kenya vs. temporary campaigns in Uganda) can lead to better resource allocation and overall efficiency gains that contribute to cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that GiveDirectly uses an operational process which adjusts interventions based on location-specific characteristics. By choosing to focus on existing countries with large populations of the poor rather than expanding geographically, GiveDirectly tailors its approach to leverage location characteristics for cost-effective impact.


### Summary_2018.md

**Quote:** We note that given our understanding that a high percentage of households in the areas where GiveDirectly uses the village saturation model are very poor (and may in fact not be wealthier than recipients under the targeting model, as we had previously assumed), it seems likely to us that the benefits of the village saturation model (e.g. reducing overhead costs associated with targeting individual households, reducing the potential for conflict between village residents, and reducing the potential for negative effects on the well-being and economic outcomes of people who live near transfer recipients and do not receive transfers) outweigh the possibility that transfers may go to recipients with somewhat higher average income.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational process based on local characteristics—using the village saturation model when nearly all households in an area are very poor—to reduce overhead costs and avoid issues such as conflict or negative spillovers. These adaptations contribute to cost effectiveness by streamlining the intervention delivery and lowering associated administrative costs.


### Supplementary Information_2018.md

**Quote:** “GiveDirectly has told us that it adjusts its transfer sizes for purchasing power; as of 2018, in Kenya, GiveDirectly transferred approximately $1,085 to each enrolled household, while in Uganda, it transferred approximately $963 and in Rwanda $970.”
“In early 2015, when selecting sub-counties and sub-locations in Kenya, GiveDirectly considered poverty data, the number of potentially eligible households, how easily it could transfer staff capacity to the new locations, and how rural each area was.”

**Reasoning:** The first quote directly demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its cash transfer amounts to the local purchasing power in different countries. This adjustment is an operational process that ensures the intervention is appropriately scaled to local economic conditions, which can enhance cost effectiveness by making sure that funds are neither under- nor over-allocated relative to local prices. The second quote shows that GiveDirectly uses a detailed assessment of location-specific factors (such as poverty levels, available eligible households, staff capacity, and rurality) during the selection of operational regions. This targeted approach likely contributes to cost effectiveness by channeling efforts and resources to areas where they can have the maximum impact with efficient use of funds.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa. GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

**Reasoning:** The first quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its transfer mechanism to local infrastructure—using M-Pesa—a system that is prevalent in Kenya, thereby reducing transaction costs and making the process more efficient. The second quote highlights how GiveDirectly employs a locally relevant indicator (thatched roofs) to identify poor households, ensuring that funds are targeted effectively. Together, these operational processes are adapted to the specific characteristics of the local environment, and such tailoring contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention by enhancing both targeting precision and delivery efficiency.


### Site visit_2012.md

**Quote:** “Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality.”

“Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.”

“Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.”

**Reasoning:** These quotes directly demonstrate how DSW tailors its interventions to the specific characteristics of each location. The first quote explains the rationale for targeting Western Kenya using local health and demographic data, which implies that focusing efforts where the need is greatest can enhance cost-effectiveness. The second and third quotes detail the operational processes for selecting areas and water points based on local conditions such as disease prevalence, water source type, and user density. By using data-driven criteria for both regional and on-site selection, DSW ensures that resources are deployed where they will have the most impact, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.


### Site visit_2014.md

**Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

**Reasoning:** This quote directly supports the research question by showing how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention to the local context—specifically, by organizing cash out days based on characteristics such as the lack of a robust agent network and liquidity in the area. This operational process reduces transportation costs for recipients, thereby contributing to the intervention's overall cost effectiveness.
