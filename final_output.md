**Quote:** The biggest difference in my daily life is that I no longer pay someone to use their sewing machine. I now save the Kes 400 instead. I will use this money to boost my business. I am now self reliant and able to comfortably take care of my family with much ease.

**Reasoning:** The recipient's ability to save money previously spent on leasing a sewing machine and reinvest it into their business highlights the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This saving allows for further business growth and financial stability, demonstrating the long-term benefits of the direct cash transfer.


### GiveDirectly Values _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** We seek step-change improvements at all levels, and are willing to make big-bets; we do not accept complacency nor do we simply optimize existing processes. In doing so, we allow ourselves to dream big with a belief that perceived constraints are merely opportunities for creativity.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights GiveDirectly's approach to seeking significant improvements and being willing to take risks. By not settling for incremental progress and instead aiming for transformative changes, the charity can adapt its interventions to the unique needs of each location, enhancing cost-effectiveness.


### Receipient feedback.md

**Quote:** "The money made a big difference in my life. I used the money to buy food and medication for my Mon."

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the cash transfer intervention directly addresses the recipient's immediate needs, enabling them to afford food and medication for their mother. The cost-effectiveness is evident as the intervention provides essential support that significantly improves the recipient's daily life and well-being.


### Financials _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** In 2018, GiveDirectly committed $32M in cash transfers in Kenya alone. If we delivered $30M in each of the six poorest countries where we work, we'd deliver $180M a year, and we have the capacity to expand to more countries if funding permitted. But in 2019, we've only raised enough to commit about $34M in cash transfers across all of our operations. We've proven the ability to deliver cash in new places, and there's no reason we can't reach many more of the poorest people in the world. As GiveWell estimates, 'GiveDirectly could productively use several hundred million dollars more than we expect it to receive.' Achieving greater scale would enable us to reach more people more efficiently, and it would carve out a bigger space for people in poverty to control more of the aid and philanthropy budgets meant to help them.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by scaling operations based on available funding and the specific needs of different locations. By committing significant funds to Kenya and having the capacity to expand to other countries, they demonstrate a cost-effective strategy that maximizes impact based on the specifics of each location.


### Research at GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes to young people living in an urban environment on a broad range of outcome measures. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions targeting young people in DRC can be assessed. It will also explore the impact of varying transfer timing to inform future cash transfer program design.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by testing different cash transfer sizes and timing for specific demographic groups (young people in urban environments). By understanding the impact of these variations, they can design more cost-effective interventions tailored to the needs of different populations.


### Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md

**Quote:** The present findings raise a number of questions for future research. First, as mentioned, the long-term effects of UCTs are topic of crucial importance for both economists and policy makers and are still incompletely understood, especially in developing countries.

**Reasoning:** This quote underscores the importance of GD's ongoing calibration of its approach by emphasizing the need for further research into the long-term effects of unconditional cash transfers. By continuously refining its understanding of these effects, GD can design more cost-effective interventions that maximize long-term benefits for recipients in developing countries.


### FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md

**Quote:** We choose to provide unconditional, rather than conditional, cash transfers for two reasons. First, empowering the poor to make their own decisions advances our core value of respect. Second, imposing conditions requires costly monitoring and enforcement structures be put in place. One detailed estimate put the administrative costs of a conditional cash transfer scheme as high as 63% of the transfers made over the first three years of the program (Caldes, Natalia, and John Maluccio. 'The Costs of Conditional Cash Transfers.' Journal of International Development 17 pp. 151-168, 2005). Our read of the existing experimental evidence comparing the impact of conditional to unconditional transfers is that there is little evidence to suggest these added costs produce commensurate benefits.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly's decision to provide unconditional cash transfers is a calibrated approach that enhances cost-effectiveness. By avoiding the high administrative costs associated with conditional transfers, they ensure that more funds are directly reaching the recipients. This approach not only respects the autonomy of the recipients but also reduces the overhead costs, making the intervention more efficient and impactful.


### GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** At full utilization our field operations will scale to ~70 staff

**Reasoning:** Scaling field operations to approximately 70 staff at full utilization indicates that GiveDirectly has a well-structured and scalable operational model. This scalability allows them to handle larger interventions without proportionally increasing costs, thereby maintaining cost-effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Smaller 'design lab' projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GD is running smaller, parallel projects to test and refine their methods. By integrating these learnings into their main campaign, they can improve the overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of their interventions.


### Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is working to grow its network in East Africa. Having allies in the countries in which it works is helpful because they can alert GiveDirectly to potential issues and help diffuse issues that arise. Towards this goal, GiveDirectly is: Connecting with people in the press and politicians in the civil service who understand power dynamics in country and are generally 'in the know.' Connecting with people who are 'outsiders,' but have valuable expertise, such as John Githongo, who has worked on transparency and anti-corruption in East Africa. Actively recruiting East African figures to be involved in leadership.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by building a strong local network. By connecting with influential individuals and recruiting local leaders, GiveDirectly can better understand and navigate the local context. This helps in identifying potential issues early and addressing them effectively, ensuring that the intervention remains cost-effective and impactful.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md

**Quote:** Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict.

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the charity is considering supplemental community targeting to improve the intervention's effectiveness but is also mindful of the additional costs and potential conflicts, showing a cost-effective approach to decision-making.


### Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly expects this study to provide new and helpful information about both a) whether supplementing cash transfers with the aspirational intervention affects recipients' spending, and b) general information on cash transfers in these Kenyan communities, which are in new areas and for which GiveDirectly will be using new, poverty-based eligibility criteria (as opposed to the specific criteria used previously in Rarieda that targeted people with grass roofs).

**Reasoning:** The aspirations study aims to understand the impact of supplementing cash transfers with aspirational interventions and to gather general information on cash transfers in new Kenyan communities. By using new poverty-based eligibility criteria, GiveDirectly can calibrate their approach to better target and serve the needs of different communities, improving the cost-effectiveness of their interventions.


### GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has begun discussing a pilot project in Bukedea District as part of this focus on new operational challenges. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is considering a pilot project in Bukedea District to test new operational approaches, such as managing cash withdrawals directly. This calibration of their approach based on local conditions and infrastructure can lead to more cost-effective and efficient interventions.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda: * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way. * Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month). * Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts. * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer. * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by making specific changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda to address issues like fraud and improve efficiency. These changes include separating roles to reduce conflicts of interest, increasing audits, conducting real-time checks, switching to a more reliable mobile money provider, and building a network of local informants. These adjustments are tailored to the local context and help ensure that the intervention is both effective and cost-efficient by preventing fraud and improving the overall delivery process.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is collaborating with the Center for Global Development to encourage the use of cash transfers as a 'benchmark' for other aid programs (to compare the impacts of a top-down, actively-managed intervention with the impacts of the cost-equivalent of that program distributed in the form of cash transfers).

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by collaborating with other organizations to promote cash transfers as a benchmark. This helps in comparing the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, thereby enabling more informed and cost-effective decision-making in aid programs.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred. In a separate meeting, community split into groups and categorized households according to housing materials. Visited, verified, and registered all households categorized as eligible by saturation criteria from the groups. Thatch is a popular criteria with communities themselves. Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture. Some people were still excluded, having been forgotten by their peers. Verifying community's recommendations - especially in cases of disagreement between groups - is essential.

**Reasoning:** The charity conducts village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria and uses a participatory approach to categorize households. This ensures that the intervention is tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the community, making it more cost-effective by reducing conflict and tension and ensuring that the most eligible households are targeted.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is tracking costs related to the study and trying to determine whether the effort to change its transfer schedule based on recipient preferences would be worth the benefit to recipients. This change would entail calling recipients to elicit their timing preferences, which would be a new step in GiveDirectly's process, so the cost of the calls would need to be compared to recipients' outcomes.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of changing its transfer schedule based on recipient preferences. This demonstrates how the charity calibrates its approach by considering the specific needs and preferences of recipients in different locations, which can lead to more efficient and effective use of resources.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by testing new distribution models and partnerships to improve efficiency and effectiveness. By piloting a distributed cashout model with MTN and exploring a new partnership with Centenary Bank, GiveDirectly aims to find the most cost-effective and convenient method for recipients to access their transfers.


### Carolina Toth, GiveDirectly, October 1, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** The data on the cost of iron roofs collected in the survey is reliable because the survey was conducted shortly after respondents had purchased roofing materials. The range of costs reported for iron roofs are concentrated within a narrower range than the costs for grass roofing.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly uses reliable data collected shortly after purchases to understand the cost dynamics of iron roofs. This approach allows them to make informed decisions and adjust their interventions based on accurate, location-specific data, ensuring cost-effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is calibrating its approach by changing the contractual agreement with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause. This helps in being cost-effective by reducing the risk of stolen funds and ensuring accountability, which protects the charity's resources.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process: * Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly tests different approaches to cash transfer distribution based on the infrastructure available in specific locations. By adapting its methods to local conditions, such as enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas, GiveDirectly ensures cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput
Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how AMF adjusts its intervention strategy based on the specific needs and conditions of each location. By focusing on different priorities in Kenya and Uganda, such as maximum throughput in Kenya and secure payments in Uganda, AMF ensures that its resources are used efficiently and effectively, leading to cost-effective outcomes.


### GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly mentioned that it may be possible to test peoples' preferences for cash versus goods by offering the option to receive either cash or goods in lieu of cash. GiveDirectly is interested in this possibility (but doesn't have plans in the near future to implement it.)

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is considering testing the preferences of recipients for cash versus goods, which would allow them to further calibrate their approach based on what is most effective and preferred by the community. This flexibility in intervention design helps ensure cost-effectiveness by aligning the program with the actual needs and preferences of the beneficiaries.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty. In a follow up meeting, GiveDirectly asked village members to work in groups to categorize each household in their village as having a matched roof, iron roof, or made from fully permanent materials.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by involving the community in the selection process. By conducting village meetings and allowing community members to categorize households based on housing materials, GiveDirectly ensures that the intervention is tailored to local preferences and conditions. This community-based targeting method enhances the cost-effectiveness of the intervention by aligning it with the specific needs and perceptions of the local population.


### Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly just received permission to work in Ukwala district in Kenya. The whole approvals process took 2 weeks from the time that Joe Huston (Kenya Field Director) met with the district commissioner to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly's efficient process for obtaining government approvals in Kenya demonstrates their ability to adapt and streamline their operations based on local bureaucratic contexts, which contributes to the cost-effectiveness of their interventions.


### Matt_Johnson_Paul_Niehaus_06-28-17_(public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has a large degree of flexibility to respond to fluctuations in funding, since its model is very scalable and its costs are variable. However, there are still fixed costs, and these will drive efficiency numbers lower as funding decreases. GiveDirectly expects fixed cost investments to decrease its efficiency from 90% last year to between 80% and 90% this year.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by maintaining flexibility in its funding model. The ability to scale and adjust variable costs allows the charity to remain cost-effective even when facing fluctuations in funding. This adaptability is crucial for ensuring that resources are used efficiently and that the charity can continue its operations effectively despite financial uncertainties.


### Matt_Johnson_02-27-17_(public).md

**Quote:** Creating more and better content (such as op eds, videos, and infographics) on topics such as cash transfers, basic income, the charity ecosystem, and GiveDirectly's new refugee work.

**Reasoning:** By creating targeted content, GiveDirectly is able to address specific interests and concerns of potential donors. This tailored approach helps in effectively communicating their impact and value, thereby making their fundraising efforts more cost-effective.


### Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by coordinating registration drives for national IDs. This step is essential for ensuring that recipients can receive their transfers without delays. By facilitating the process of obtaining national IDs, GiveDirectly ensures that the intervention is more efficient and cost-effective, as it reduces the time and resources needed to resolve issues related to identification.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md

**Quote:** We are considering experimenting with a few aspects of our transfer model: * _Frequency of payments._ The preliminary results from the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a GiveDirectly campaign have suggested very slight differences between lump-sum and stream payments. Some recipients of GiveDirectly cash transfers report that they would prefer lump sum payments, while others report that they'd prefer stream payments. There may be a benefit in giving recipients the ability to choose the frequency of their payments. * _Messaging to recipients._ One of the difficulties of running a cash transfer program is ensuring that all recipients are given a consistent and accurate message about the program. Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached. Once GiveDirectly is confident that its field staff are delivering a consistent message, it may be interested in varying that message to emphasize different elements, such as encouraging long-term investments versus not giving any advice on how funds should be spent. * _Providing information on how other people have used funds._ The most popular use of funds in past transfers has been purchasing metal roofs. It's possible this is because it is the most beneficial use of funds, but its also possible that recipients purchase roofs because that is the social norm. It would be interesting to see if providing information about how other people have used funds creatively (e.g., to purchase a motorcycle) influences the way recipients spend funds.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is experimenting with different aspects of its transfer model to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of its cash transfer programs. By adjusting the frequency of payments, improving messaging to recipients, and providing information on how others have used funds, GiveDirectly can tailor its approach to better meet the needs and preferences of recipients in different locations. This calibration helps ensure that the intervention is cost-effective by maximizing the impact of each dollar spent.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md

**Quote:** Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * **Census:** Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * **Enrollment:** Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * **Back check:** Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered

**Reasoning:** The quote shows how GiveDirectly uses performance-based incentives for staff to ensure efficiency and accuracy in their operations, which contributes to cost-effectiveness by reducing errors and improving outcomes.


### GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly told us that this has been its plan since before starting to make the second round of transfers. GiveDirectly said that it decided to conduct a second campaign this year, despite knowing that it would end up pausing enrollment afterwards, to take advantage of its presence in Uganda to build out the organizational structure and operations there, which were not as formally established as those in Kenya.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly's decision to pause enrollment in Uganda after a second campaign demonstrates strategic planning to build organizational capacity and operations in a new location. This approach ensures that resources are used efficiently and that the organization is better prepared for future campaigns, contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md

**Quote:** In response, GiveDirectly has been more proactive in coordinating with the mobile money service for the transfers that have begun, for example, by giving the mobile money service advanced notice before sending the funds so that agents could be prepared. In some cases, agents traveled to the villages in which recipients live to reduce recipient travel time.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by proactively coordinating with mobile money services and ensuring that agents are prepared in advance. This reduces recipient travel time and enhances the efficiency of the intervention, making it more cost-effective.


### Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md

**Quote:** In two of its experimental campaigns (the experiment to increase throughput in Kenya and its work in a coffee farming community), GiveDirectly is experimenting with a 'wave' approach. In this scenario, the same officers perform multiple steps; however, for steps intended to provide a check on previous steps, officers do not perform multiple steps in the same village. This ensures that the same field officer does not visit a household twice during the enrollment process.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is experimenting with a 'wave' approach in certain campaigns to increase efficiency. By having the same officers perform multiple steps while ensuring checks are maintained, they aim to streamline the enrollment process. This calibrated approach helps in managing resources more effectively, contributing to cost-effectiveness.


### Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md

**Quote:** With more funding, GiveDirectly could conduct additional experiments aimed at influencing policy and building relationships with governments and aid organizations. Attendees at a recent social protection conference in Kenya were interested in the link between variation in transfer size and the effectiveness of cash transfers. GiveDirectly could use additional funding to study this issue.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by conducting experiments to influence policy and build relationships. By studying issues like the variation in transfer size, GiveDirectly can optimize its interventions, making them more cost-effective and impactful.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md

**Quote:** Deployment of the Segovia system in Kenya is ongoing in parallel with development; new features are incorporated and bugs are worked out in the field, in real time. GiveDirectly plans to begin using Segovia in Uganda at some point in 2015, although an exact date has not been chosen. The exact date of the rollout in Uganda will depend on whether or not Segovia is suitable for the payments pilot.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly is calibrating its approach by deploying the Segovia system in Kenya while simultaneously developing and refining it. This real-time development and testing ensure that the system is effective and efficient before rolling it out in Uganda, demonstrating a cost-effective strategy by minimizing risks and maximizing the system's utility.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Quote:** However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion: 1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate. 2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country. 3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.

**Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by considering specific conditions under which it would expand to new countries. By only expanding when it aligns with important policy research, institutional funder interests, or when sufficient funding is available, GiveDirectly ensures that its interventions remain cost-effective and impactful.


### Summary_2018.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has told us that recipients are generally able to withdraw cash from mobile money agents located in or near their villages. Recipients must pay a small fee when they withdraw a portion of their transfer (around 1% for large withdrawals, and higher for small withdrawals).

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly's use of mobile money providers is tailored to the local context, ensuring that recipients can easily access their funds. By leveraging existing mobile money infrastructure, GiveDirectly reduces the cost and complexity of cash distribution. This approach is cost-effective as it minimizes logistical expenses and ensures that recipients can access their funds with minimal hassle.


### Supplementary Information_2018.md

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has told us that while it expects the cost-effectiveness of direct transfers through this project to be lower than its standard program, it believes the potential for beneficial policy impact, which is hard to quantify, outweighs any difference.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly acknowledges that certain interventions may have lower cost-effectiveness in terms of direct transfers but considers the broader policy impact. This strategic calibration allows the charity to balance immediate cost-effectiveness with long-term benefits, ensuring that interventions are tailored to achieve the greatest overall impact.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md

**Quote:** AMF hosts meetings with local health officials and has planning workshops. Community sensitization activities are implemented to provide more community 'ownership' of the program and make people aware of the distribution date and location. AMF rarely works with partners that do not have a connection with local communities because they noticed that working with these partners is associated with nets being in better condition.

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by engaging with local communities and health officials through meetings and workshops. This ensures that the intervention is tailored to the specific needs and conditions of the community, leading to better outcomes and more cost-effective use of resources.


### Site visit_2012.md

**Quote:** DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water.

**Reasoning:** This quote shows how DSW calibrates its approach by experimenting with different incentive models for promoters. By testing and refining these models, DSW can identify the most cost-effective way to encourage community participation and ensure the sustained use of chlorine dispensers, thereby maximizing the impact of its intervention.


### Site visit_2014.md

**Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

**Reasoning:** GiveDirectly calibrates its approach by organizing cash out days in Uganda to address the lack of robust agent networks and insufficient liquidity in the villages. This adjustment reduces costs for recipients who would otherwise incur transportation expenses to access their funds, demonstrating a cost-effective strategy tailored to the local context.
