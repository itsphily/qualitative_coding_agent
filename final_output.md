- **Quote:** The costs of the GD program at the time of the study amounted to $81 (nominal) per household. Given the proportions of large and small transfers sent at the time, this figure translates to a cost of $113 (nominal) per household for a large transfer ($1,000 nominal), that is, 11%, and $69 (nominal) for a small transfer ($300 nominal), that is, 23%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides concrete details on how GD’s operational costs are measured relative to transfer size, indicating that the charity adjusts its financial and operational planning based on local cost conditions. Such calibration helps ensure that the intervention remains cost efficient by keeping delivery costs in proportion to transfer amounts.

- **Quote:** GD’s operating model has changed since the time of the study. Eligibility is now based not only on a census conducted with a village guide, but is additionally verified by physical back-checks, data back-checks, and crowd-sourced labor to confirm recipient identity and thatched-roof ownership.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GD adapted its eligibility verification process by incorporating multiple layers of local checks tailored to the on-the-ground conditions. By calibrating the targeting process to local characteristics (e.g., thatched roof as an indicator of poverty), the charity enhances the likelihood that resources reach the right beneficiaries, thereby improving overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GD estimates the average travel time and cost from recipient households to the nearest M-Pesa agent at 42 minutes and $0.64 (nominal). Withdrawals incur costs between 27% for $2 (nominal) withdrawals and 0.06% for $800 (nominal) withdrawals.

  **Reasoning:** This quote reflects how local logistical factors—such as travel time and variable withdrawal fees—are measured and incorporated into the operational strategy. By accounting for local infrastructure and cost differences, the intervention can be calibrated to use the most cost-effective delivery mechanisms available in each locality.


### FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md - important to read
- **Quote:** No. In order to be as fair to all as possible, we select recipients using a systematic and proactive set of criteria that vary from country to country, and do not accept inbound applications.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its process based on the characteristics of each country. By varying its criteria across different locations, the organization calibrates its intervention to match local contexts, an operational strategy that underlies their approach to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We consider working in additional countries only when there is a strong argument that we can increase our impact by enough to justify the fixed setup costs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly highlights how location-specific assessments (such as existing poverty levels and electronic payment infrastructure) inform the decision to expand. By ensuring that the fixed setup costs are offset by a greater potential impact, GiveDirectly’s calibration of interventions serves as an operational process to enhance cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public) supplementary material.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track our costs with greater granularity

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity is modifying its operational process to capture detailed cost data. While it does not explicitly mention location-specific calibration, such granularity can enable the organization to adjust interventions based on local cost differences, thus potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Newly recruited [New Country] FD will begin in mid-October and have capacity of $5.0M (adjusted for 2 month apprenticeship)

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates a deliberate adaptation of field operations by recruiting a Field Director for a new country, with capacity tailored to local context. This approach reflects calibrating interventions to specific locations, which can help ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and cost effectively.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Kenya rolling campaign increased speed, with smaller campaigns driving learning in both Kenya and Uganda

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates an operational approach where the charity uses a rolling campaign alongside smaller, localized campaigns to generate learnings. Such an approach suggests that the intervention is being dynamically adapted to different local contexts, which can contribute to greater cost-effectiveness by enabling rapid adjustment based on location-specific experiences.

- **Quote:** Smaller "design lab" projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow

  **Reasoning:** This line demonstrates that the charity integrates targeted, experimental projects into its main operation. By embedding these design labs, the organization appears to calibrate its interventions according to local conditions and evolving insights, a process that can ultimately enhance cost-efficiency through context-specific adjustments.


### Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly may eventually conduct transfers in urban areas, where targeting criteria would have to change because common housing materials differ.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the organization plans to calibrate its intervention by adjusting targeting criteria based on the specific characteristics of urban areas. Tailoring the criteria to local housing features is an example of adapting operations to enhance the effective use of resources.

- **Quote:** It may also work in northern regions of Kenya in the future, where there is no mobile money provider, so GiveDirectly staff would have to either work with branch banks to distribute cash or take armored vehicles with cash on designated distribution dates. These processes would be more expensive and higher risk, but it is something that GiveDirectly would like to build its capacity for.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that in areas lacking standard infrastructure (like mobile money), the charity adapts its cash distribution method by considering alternatives. Although these methods are costlier and riskier, the process of adjusting operations to local conditions reflects an effort to maintain overall cost effectiveness by meeting unique regional demands.

- **Quote:** Geographic diversification is one way of preparing for potential issues, because it gives GiveDirectly the flexibility to shift spending out of an area if problems arise. This is one benefit of GiveDirectly expanding to Uganda.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that by operating across multiple locations and being ready to reallocate spending based on emerging local challenges, the organization can manage costs more efficiently. This operational flexibility, tied to local characteristics, supports overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization tailors its targeting efforts by using granular, location-specific data. By collecting data at different administrative units (sublocations in Kenya and parishes in Uganda), the charity adapts its intervention to the unique geographic and demographic characteristics of each locale, an operational process that can enhance cost effectiveness through more precise resource allocation.

- **Quote:** Community based targeting pilots completed
  
  Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria.
  Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests.
  Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)
  Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list
  Process
  Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction
  All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions
  In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations
  Majority of households are widows, almost half have one family member that is disabled or very sick.
  Households seem to be as or more needy than typical GD recipients
  Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations).
  May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs.
  Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict.
  Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.

  **Reasoning:** This extended quote outlines a pilot for community-based targeting that adjusts the intervention based on local village feedback and conditions. The process, which includes considering a door-to-door approach and evaluating additional census questions, reflects the organization’s effort to calibrate its intervention by adapting to local characteristics. It highlights how the charity weighs cost tradeoffs and operational adjustments as part of its strategy to enhance cost effectiveness.


### Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly expects this study to provide new and helpful information about both a) whether supplementing cash transfers with the aspirational intervention affects recipients' spending, and b) general information on cash transfers in these Kenyan communities, which are in new areas and for which GiveDirectly will be using new, poverty-based eligibility criteria (as opposed to the specific criteria used previously in Rarieda that targeted people with grass roofs).

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is calibrating its intervention to local contexts by adapting eligibility criteria based on the specific characteristics of new areas. This adaptation implies an operational process aimed at better targeting and, potentially, enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has done some non-experimental operational research in remote parts of Uganda to examine the feasibility of implementing its program in places where, e.g., there is no cell coverage, there are no local mobile money agents, villages are several hours on foot from the nearest road, etc. GiveDirectly hopes to gather information about these recipients' experiences of receiving cash transfers, withdrawing transfers, and generally test the limits of who it can get transfers to effectively.

  **Reasoning:** This passage reflects how GiveDirectly adapts its operational approach to overcome location-specific challenges, such as infrastructure limitations. By investigating local conditions, the charity is effectively calibrating its intervention to ensure efficient delivery, which indirectly supports enhanced cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Uganda naturally presents more operational challenges than Kenya, so it makes sense to experiment with new operational approaches there. In addition, the GE study is the focus in Kenya, so GiveDirectly thinks it is better to locate its operational experimentation elsewhere.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates that GiveDirectly tailors its operational approach based on location-specific conditions. By recognizing that Uganda's unique challenges require experimental methods while Kenya is dedicated to the GE study, the organization calibrates its intervention to better address local needs, which can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has begun discussing a pilot project in Bukedea District as part of this focus on new operational challenges. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.

  **Reasoning:** This evidence shows a concrete example of calibration: the charity is considering modifying its distribution method in Bukedea District. This adaptation to local conditions – potentially bypassing limitations in existing infrastructure – is indicative of an operational process aimed at optimizing cost efficiency.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational structure based on local context – in Kenya the segregation of roles is already established, while in Uganda new measures are being implemented. Such calibration, responding to local operational challenges, implies enhanced efficiency that can lead to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an adaptation of the intervention to local circumstances – switching payment providers based on the robustness of local networks. Tailoring the approach to the characteristics of the local financial infrastructure is an operational adjustment that can enhance cost effectiveness by reducing constraints and improving service delivery.

- **Quote:** Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.

  **Reasoning:** By contrasting the efficiency between the Kenyan and Ugandan programs, this quote shows that GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention strategy according to local conditions. The established, more efficient model in Kenya underscores how location-specific operational setups are associated with greater efficiency, a key component of cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has allocated most of its current funds towards enrolling recipients in Kenya, in order to continue implementing the rolling model for field operations and to build the sample for the general equilibrium effects study. These goals will take precedence over GiveDirectly's work in Uganda, where it expects to stop committing to new recipients in August 2014, until funds allow for additional recipients (see page 12 of GiveDirectly's written update).

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is making strategic, location-specific operational decisions—prioritizing Kenya where their ‘rolling model’ is already in place. By focusing on locations that already have established operational processes, the charity implicitly enhances cost effectiveness through lower marginal operational and setup costs.

- **Quote:** Relative to Kenya, core operations make up a higher proportion of costs in Uganda because more management time has been invested in setting up GiveDirectly's operations and building the organization in Uganda.

  **Reasoning:** This statement highlights a direct comparison between locations, indicating that operational costs vary significantly by context. The need for greater initial investment in Uganda suggests that adapting interventions to the maturity and characteristics of each location can drive better cost efficiency—if an intervention is calibrated to leverage existing operational strengths, cost effectiveness is enhanced.

- **Quote:** Based on feedback from DFID and other large governmental and bilateral organizations over time, GiveDirectly would need to gain experience implementing cash transfers programs in different geographies (e.g., urban) and at a larger scale in order to work more closely with those organizations as an implementing and thought partner.

  **Reasoning:** This quote underlines the importance of tailoring cash transfer implementations to different geographic contexts. Although it does not mention cost effectiveness directly, it reinforces the idea that calibrating interventions based on location-specific characteristics is essential for scaling operations and potentially improving cost efficiency by aligning with the local dynamics and stakeholder expectations.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Village selection & Manual estimation of that-iron proportion at village level using satellite imagery & Machine learning algorithm that estimates that-iron coverage & Parish-level census data with poverty measures, and mobile money

  **Reasoning:** This quote, extracted from the operational table on page 3, shows that the charity uses different village selection methods tailored to different campaign locations (Kenya and Uganda). Adapting the selection process based on local data collection methods (manual estimation, machine learning, and census data) exemplifies how the intervention is calibrated to the specific characteristics of each location—an approach that can lead to more efficient allocation of resources and thereby enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred

  **Reasoning:** This quote from page 5 highlights the charity’s process of engaging with local communities to determine appropriate eligibility criteria. By incorporating community preferences into their targeting strategy, the charity calibrates its intervention to local context, which can help ensure that resources are used more effectively and potentially improve cost effectiveness through better alignment with local needs.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly's team is working at a rate of about $10 million per year. In Uganda, GiveDirectly's current campaign is disbursing $2 million; the model of rolling enrollment, which GiveDirectly uses in Kenya, has not been adopted in Uganda yet.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly uses different operational models in Kenya and Uganda based on each location's characteristics. The fact that Kenya uses a rolling enrollment model while Uganda does not yet adopt it suggests an intentional calibration of intervention to suit local contexts, which can enhance cost effectiveness by aligning the process with the scale and pace of operations in each country.

- **Quote:** Under GiveDirectly's rolling model (as in Kenya), a field director may update the database daily, as each team needs data from it and may be carrying out activities in quick succession. In Uganda, the database requires updates only about twice a week.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides clear evidence of how operational practices are calibrated based on local needs. By adjusting the database update frequency to match the rate of activity—daily in Kenya versus twice a week in Uganda—GiveDirectly optimizes resource use, thus potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is considering shifting Uganda onto more of a rolling model so that both Kenya and Uganda may operate at capacity, given enough funding.

  **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that the organization is actively evaluating how to adapt its intervention protocol in Uganda by emulating the successful rolling model used in Kenya. Such calibration, aimed at enabling both regions to operate at full capacity, is directly linked to enhancing overall cost effectiveness by ensuring that the operational process is tailored to local conditions.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
  
  The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its targeting strategy to local conditions—using thatched roofs as a poverty indicator in some areas but seeking alternatives in others where that indicator is not prevalent. Such calibration of intervention methods according to local characteristics ensures that resources are allocated more effectively, which can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention in response to local economic conditions. By adjusting transfer amounts to account for inflation, the organization ensures that the real value of cash transfers is maintained despite rising operational costs, which is a key operational process that supports sustained cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Setting efficiency targets for each campaign
  
  In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.
  The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt shows that GiveDirectly tailors its efficiency targets based on country-specific cost structures. By adjusting budgeting and staffing strategies to local conditions, the organization operationalizes a calibration process that helps to optimize resource use and maintain cost effectiveness across different regions.


### Carolina Toth, GiveDirectly, October 1, 2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Variable cost of grass: The cost of grass roofing varies widely depending on the proximity of villages to sources of suitable grass. Costs are much higher in villages far from grass sources.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that local geographic factors affect roofing costs. Such variation implies that an intervention could be calibrated by taking into account the specific cost dynamics of each location, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness through location-specific adaptation.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted a survey of 20 random CT recipients from 20 different villages. The sampling method entailed calling one person at random in each of the randomly selected villages until someone answered the phone and was able to provide answers to the survey questions.

  **Reasoning:** Although the quote does not explicitly describe an operational process for calibrating interventions, its demonstration of collecting data from multiple, diverse locations indicates that the charity recognizes location-specific differences. This approach could serve as a basis for tailoring or calibrating interventions to local conditions in order to improve cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** * **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention by adopting alternative cash transfer distribution methods based on local infrastructure differences. By tailoring methods for areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, the organization is adapting its operational process to the specific characteristics of each location, which can enhance cost effectiveness by leveraging local resources instead of building new infrastructure.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is adjusting its targeting strategy based on local feedback and demographic characteristics, in this case in Homa Bay County. Calibrating the intervention to local vulnerabilities and socio-economic conditions is an operational approach that can lead to more efficient resource allocation and potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence of strategic recalibration in response to location-specific regulatory environments. By shifting some funding from Uganda to Rwanda due to adverse local conditions, GiveDirectly is adapting its operational process to optimize outcomes and enhance cost effectiveness, ensuring that resources are deployed where they are most likely to yield efficient results.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md - important to read
- **Quote:** 2015 operational priorities (see appendix for deprioritized)
  
  Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput
  
  Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process
  
  Confirmed
  Complete Segovia deployment in Kenya and deploy in Uganda
  
  Deliver a viable, field-tested plan for poverty targeting in any context

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity explicitly differentiates its operational strategies based on location. By allocating funds differently—focusing on maximum throughput in Kenya and enhancing secure payment processes in Uganda—the organization calibrates its intervention to local conditions, a process aimed at enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored
  
  \begin{tabular}{c c c c}
  **Modification** & **Potential benefit** & **Potential cost** & **Sizing implications** \\ Eliminate "paydays" & 1.0\% efficiency gain & Higher travel costs & Minimum scale of one village (200 recipients) \\  & & & \\ Use bank (vs telco) as payments vendor & 1.3\% efficiency gain & FD time required to build/manage & Likely need 1K+ recipients to make partnership \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\ Use biometric authentication & & Lower risks of certain frauds & 1.1\% efficiency loss for 1.5M campaign 1 & Need 0.5K recipients for 99\% chance of \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\\n\end{tabular}

  **Reasoning:** This table from page 16 provides detailed, location-specific modifications to Uganda's payment protocol along with quantified efficiency impacts. It exemplifies an operational process where the intervention is calibrated based on local conditions with the goal of optimizing cost effectiveness.


### GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** In the Kenya 1.2M campaign, villages were selected based on the proportion of match to iron roofs, which was manually estimated using satellite imagery. In the Kenya scale-up, GiveDirectly used a machine learning algorithm that estimates the proportion of match to iron roofs in a village using satellite imagery. The algorithm was developed for GiveDirectly by a group called DataKind, which provided its support pro bono. In the Uganda scale-up, GiveDirectly selected villages based on census data at the parish level (a parish has a few villages). The data allowed GiveDirectly to identify very poor districts in Eastern Uganda, its target region.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its village selection process to the unique data and infrastructural characteristics of different locations (using satellite imagery in Kenya and census data in Uganda). Adapting the selection mechanism to local conditions is an operational process that likely enhances cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are efficiently allocated to the most appropriate areas.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly used the categorized lists generated from these village meetings in place of a census. Households that had been marked as eligible by all groups were added to the registration list, households unanimously marked as ineligible were not added to the registration list, and in cases where groups had made different categorizations of the same household, GiveDirectly staff followed up with the household to determine eligibility. GiveDirectly's impression is that the village members who participated in community-based targeting enjoyed the process. Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a calibration of the intervention process by leveraging local community input for household eligibility, rather than relying on a full census. The adaptation to local dynamics not only improves targeting accuracy but also reduces costs, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, transfers are sent in ten equal installments, and GiveDirectly works with the mobile money providers to coordinate pay out days, as their agent networks are less robust than those in Kenya. GiveDirectly expects to continue to have to coordinate pay out days, but hopes that it can move towards sending larger payments less frequently, like the Kenya model of a token transfer then two lump sums.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusts its cash disbursement strategy based on local infrastructural capabilities—in this case, the less robust mobile money networks in Uganda. By calibrating the transfer timing to local conditions, the organization aims to streamline operations and reduce coordination costs, contributing to enhanced cost effectiveness.


### Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In the villages in GiveDirectly's two Uganda campaigns to date, about 80% of the households are eligible based on its standard criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor). In Kenya, about 35-45% of the households meet these criteria.
  
  GiveDirectly said that it analyzed data on building materials and consumption in Uganda and found a similar correlation to that in Kenya, so it believes that using building materials is still an effective targeting method for reaching the poorest of the poor in Uganda.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention by analyzing location-specific data on household materials and consumption. The differing eligibility percentages between Uganda and Kenya prompt a tailored approach that likely enhances cost effectiveness by ensuring that resources are directed accurately towards the poorest.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is considering minor modifications to its targeting criteria, but has decided not to focus on that until Segovia technology is fully deployed and the organization has more bandwidth. Such changes would be intended to include among eligible households those that are considered especially vulnerable by their communities despite having iron roofs, such as widows or those with very poor quality iron roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the organization's intent to further adapt its targeting criteria to local nuances. The planned modifications based on community-identified vulnerabilities represent an operational calibration that can improve cost effectiveness by better directing aid to those most in need.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that in Kenya it is important to maintain relationships with government officials at the county and district levels; district commissioners introduce GiveDirectly to chiefs, and chiefs introduce GiveDirectly to village elders. In Uganda, there are no counties, so GiveDirectly coordinates with a few people at the district level to acquire approvals, and from there connect with officials at the local level.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to the distinct governmental structures in Kenya and Uganda. By tailoring the approach to fit local administrative frameworks, the organization streamlines the approval process, which can enhance cost effectiveness by reducing delays and associated costs.


### Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** The logistics are significantly harder in Uganda than in Kenya. For example, when GiveDirectly enters a new village in Uganda, over 90% of recipients need SIM cards because they did not previously have cell phones, and about 70-80% of recipients need national IDs. GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there are 9 villages, and GiveDirectly was able to put them all through the national ID registration process within 1 month, so that 90% of eligible households were ready to receive transfers when payments started. (The remaining households will receive their transfers on a delayed schedule, once they complete registration.)

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its operational procedures to address Uganda's distinctive local challenges—such as the high need for SIM cards and national IDs—to ensure that households are promptly prepared for transfers. By adapting its process to local conditions, the charity enhances operational efficiency, which is a key mechanism likely contributing to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly did not used to do a census of the whole village before registering eligible households. The census was added so that GiveDirectly could have a full picture of the village, not miss any households, and would be better able to track households that were shifting around. Also, without a census documenting information about each household, it is more likely that word would spread about households being registered and other households would try to pose as eligible when they were first visited.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adaptation where a comprehensive village census is introduced to capture local dynamics and prevent misidentification of eligible households. Such calibration to unique local circumstances minimizes errors and potential fraud, thereby indirectly supporting cost effectiveness through improved targeting and resource allocation.


### GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** 3. Villages in which nearly all households will receive transfers (all households with mud walls and thatch _or_ metal roofs will receive transfers, only households with cement walls and metal roofs will be excluded)

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention by using housing characteristics (mud walls, thatch, metal roofs, cement walls) as criteria for inclusion. This tailoring of transfer targeting based on observable, local conditions is an example of calibrating the intervention to the specific context, which could enhance cost effectiveness by optimizing the allocation of resources, even though the text does not explicitly discuss cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is exploring changes to its operational procedures to affect efficiency—a key element of cost effectiveness. Although it does not directly mention adapting interventions to local characteristics, it demonstrates an operational focus on refining processes that can potentially improve the cost and overall effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that it decided to conduct a second campaign this year, despite knowing that it would end up pausing enrollment afterwards, to take advantage of its presence in Uganda to build out the organizational structure and operations there, which were not as formally established as those in Kenya.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention by adapting its operational approach to the specific characteristics of each location. In Uganda, where organizational structures are less established compared to Kenya, the charity opts to pause enrollment to invest in building local capacity, which is an operational process aimed at enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One reason to pause new enrollments in Uganda is for GiveDirectly to direct all transfers to Kenya to increase the sample size for this study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a strategic reallocation of resources based on location-specific readiness. By pausing enrollments in Uganda and focusing transfers in Kenya, where processes such as baseline data collection are already in place, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to maximize operational efficiency and, consequently, cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly selected a region of the country to set up initial operations in based on poverty data.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention by choosing regions based on local poverty data, demonstrating the calibration of operations to local conditions. By focusing on areas with higher need, the charity likely enhances the cost effectiveness of its transfers by targeting resources where they can have the greatest impact.

- **Quote:** It determined this could be valuable given concerns about poor cell phone network coverage in the targeted geography and limitations with the other mobile money service's customer service). It has since established a partnership with this second company for roughly half of its planned transfers in the campaign. While the first service has more agents nationwide, the second service has been more willing to collaborate with GiveDirectly and customize the service to its needs.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates GiveDirectly's adaptive approach to its operational process. By initiating a dual-provider pilot and partnering with a mobile money service that can customize its offerings, the organization is calibrating its intervention to address the specific logistical challenges of the local context. This tailored strategy is an example of how adapting to local conditions can potentially enhance cost effectiveness by reducing operational inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** After observing an increase in refusals in its Kenya program, GiveDirectly began offering services in a different sub-county (Nyando). Initial refusal rates in Nyando were also very high, which indicated that this might be a broader problem requiring additional attention and resources.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly monitors local performance metrics—in this case, heightened refusal rates in a specific sub-county—and adapts its intervention by shifting service locations, a calibration that could enhance cost effectiveness by targeting areas with more favorable reception.

- **Quote:** High refusal rates primarily impact the productivity of census teams; for example, if 50% of households refuse registration, the team must replace them with new households. In order to continue to reach enrollment targets in Kenya, GiveDirectly has provided additional support by increasing census team sizes and adjusting team members' locations.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that GiveDirectly makes operational adjustments based on local challenges (i.e., high refusal rates) by calibrating team deployment. Such adaptations are likely designed to maintain efficiency and control costs when local conditions are less favorable.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has often found the 'payday' payment model too restrictive. In its Uganda program, it has successfully tested a 'cash-out' model. Recipients and agents were able to overcome liquidity constraints, and in Uganda, GiveDirectly distributes $700,000 to $1 million per month without any increases in fraud.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly tailors its payment process to local conditions—in this case, addressing liquidity constraints in Uganda by adopting a 'cash-out' model. This calibrated approach likely enhances operational cost effectiveness by ensuring smoother transfers and reducing potential losses from restrictive payment models.


### Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** A single campaign (not a rolling campaign) is planned in Uganda, as a "payments pilot". This will be designed to learn about the different payment systems that could be used for transfers; the focus on learning about payments will slow the program down. After it is completed, GiveDirectly hopes to begin rolling enrollments in Uganda.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its intervention in Uganda by piloting different payment methods before a full rollout, indicating a calibration process that adapts to local characteristics. Such an approach can enhance cost effectiveness by ensuring the intervention is suited to the operational context of the location.

- **Quote:** The easiest way for GiveDirectly to increase its capacity to carry out transfers would be to hire more Field Officers (FOs). This could be done first in Kenya, then in Uganda after the program to test different payment methods has been completed.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows that the charity deploys a location-specific strategy—scaling up operations in Kenya, where processes are already established, and waiting to expand in Uganda until payment methods have been tested. This calibrated approach ensures that resource allocation is optimized based on local readiness, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Most likely uses for additional funding/room for more funding: If GiveDirectly were to receive additional retail donations on the order of $1-3 million from retail donors, the board would likely allocate the donations to transfers in Kenya. GiveDirectly still plans to scale up in Kenya and wants to retain its staff there. In addition, retail donations must be committed to the field, as this is indicated on GiveDirectly's website. If there were a strategic opportunity in Uganda, the board might decide to commit retail donations which had been specified for distribution in any country there.

  **Reasoning:** This quote reveals that the allocation of additional funding is calibrated to location-specific opportunities, with a predisposition to invest in areas (like Kenya) where scaling operations is already underway while remaining open to opportunities in Uganda. This selective funding strategy exemplifies an operational process that adapts interventions to local conditions to achieve greater cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote reveals that GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention based on the population and infrastructure characteristics of existing locations. By choosing to serve more people in its current countries rather than incurring the high fixed costs of new setups, the charity enhances cost efficiency as an operational process.

- **Quote:** However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:
  1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.
  2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.
  3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder’s country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.

  **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the criteria GiveDirectly uses to decide when to deviate from its usual model. It illustrates the operational process of adapting interventions to location-specific factors—such as research needs, funder demands, or funding levels—to ensure that the benefits outweigh the extra expenses, thereby preserving cost-effectiveness.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity tailors its targeting by using a locally relevant indicator—household roof type—to identify poverty. By adapting the eligibility criteria to a context-specific signal of low resources, the organization effectively calibrates its intervention to local conditions, which is an important step in ensuring funds are directed in a cost‐effective manner.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs. This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.

  **Reasoning:** This passage evidences that the charity collects local data on asset costs (in this case, roof costs) across villages to inform its investment return calculations. By using context-specific economic data, the charity refines its cost-effectiveness analysis, illustrating how calibrating its intervention to local market conditions can enhance operational efficiency and overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that DSW calibrates its intervention by selecting operational areas based on local data (e.g., disease prevalence, water source characteristics, and population density), a key adaptation that ensures resources are targeted to where they have the greatest potential impact and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 6. **Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This passage details how DSW adapts the intervention to local conditions by setting specific, location-tailored criteria for water point selection, ensuring that chlorine dispensers are installed only where they are likely to be effective and efficient, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the intervention strategy is calibrated to the local context, with the choice of location being driven by specific local conditions that maximize the intervention’s impact. By targeting areas where water quality is the primary concern, DSW leverages its resources for greater cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates an adaptive process where feedback from early pilot implementations led to refined, location-specific guidelines for dispenser placement. Such iterative calibration of operational procedures is instrumental in improving cost efficiency and intervention effectiveness over time.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its intervention based on location-specific characteristics. By establishing cash out days in areas with weak mobile money infrastructure, they minimize additional costs (like transportation) thereby enhancing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.
