# Mass Distribution of Long-Lasting Insecticide-Treated Nets (LLINs)

In a nutshell

This page discusses the case for mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) for protection against malaria. In general, we focus our discussion on work similar to that of the Against Malaria Foundation. This intervention involves trying to achieve universal ownership of LLINs within a population, giving free new LLINs to the people who do not already have them. There is strong evidence that when large numbers of people use LLINs to protect themselves while sleeping, the burden of malaria can be reduced, resulting in a reduction in child mortality among other benefits. LLINs cost under $10 each to purchase and distribute (including all costs), and this intervention is generally considered to be among the most cost-effective ways to save lives. Mass distribution of LLINs is in the same range of cost-effectiveness as other priority programs we have considered.

What is malaria (the disease targeted by LLINs)? Malaria is one of the leading causes of child deaths in Africa.1 It is transmitted from person to person by infected mosquitoes.2 It involves flu-like symptoms including fever.3 As discussed below, there is evidence connecting malaria with death (particularly in children under 5), anemia, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), other nutrition-deficiency-related indicators, and low birthweight. It is also believed that malaria can cause permanent disability (hearing impairment, visual impairment, epilepsy, etc. ).4

## What is LLIN distribution and how does it target malaria? 

An insecticide-treated net (ITN) is a net (usually a bed net), designed to block mosquitoes physically, that has been treated with safe, residual insecticide for the purpose of killing and repelling mosquitoes, which carry malaria.5 A **long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN)6** is an ITN designed to remain effective for multiple years without retreatment.7 The World Health Organization recommends that LLINs be distributed for free to achieve universal coverage (one LLIN for every 1.8 people in the target population) of those at risk for malaria.8 An LLIN distribution involves surveying people to determine the need for LLINs; delivering LLINs; and promoting the use of LLINs (to read our notes from visiting an ongoing LLIN distribution, see our page on October 201 site visits).

## What is the evidence regarding the general effectiveness of LLIN distributions?

### Evidence from small-scale, high-quality studies

The best evidence for the effectiveness of LLIN distributions comes from randomized controlled trials of insecticide-treated net campaigns, which are reviewed in two Cochrane reviews (Lengeler 2004a; Gamble, Ekwaru, and ter Kuile 2006). We have separately found, examined, and summarized the papers reviewed in Lengeler 2004a.9

The studies are mostly short-term, examining insecticide-treated nets (not necessarily LLINs) over a period of 6 months to 2 years. Lengeler's (2004a) meta-analysis, examining 22 studies,10 found:

_Mortality_ (5 studies): a statistically significant impact on all-cause mortality in children under 5, summarized as "5.53 deaths averted per 1000 children protected per year" with no clear dependence on one measure of the regional malaria transmission dynamics.11 Two studies attempted to examine malaria-specific mortality and found smaller or similar-sized effects, which the review author attributes to the difficulty of attributing mortality to malaria.12

Note that the above figure ("5.53 deaths averted per 1000 children protected per year") is based on people who could be covered by the ITNs distributed, not on people who are confirmed to be using ITNs (i.e., the implication is that .00553 lives are saved for every child under five who _could be covered by a distributed ITN_, not that .00553 lives are saved for every child under five who is _confirmed to be using an ITN_).13

_Anemia_ (9 studies): statistically significant impacts on haemoglobin levels, about +1.3 g/L when insecticide-treated nets were compared to untreated nets and +5.7 g/L when insecticide-treated nets were compared to no nets.14 (More on how to interpret these g/L figures at our writeup on deworming.) _Splenomegaly_ (enlarged spleen) (5 studies): about 23% protective efficacy (which we presume means that the nets reduced splenomegaly by 23%) when insecticide-treated nets were compared to untreated nets and 30% protective efficacy when insecticide-treated nets were compared to no nets.15

Effects that were usually statistically significant in individual trials, but were not combined into summary analysis, for severe malarial disease,16 uncomplicated clinical episodes of malaria,17 prevalence of malaria parasites,18 high parasitemia (prevalence of malaria parasites in the blood),19 and nutrition-related measures (weight for age, weight for height, mean mid-upper arm circumference but not height-for-age or unspecified other measures).20

Gamble et al. (2006) focused on the effects on pregnant women; it examined fewer studies than Lengeler (2004a) (6 vs. 22). It connected ITNs with statistically significant reductions in the risk of low birthweight and fetal loss (only in women with four or fewer previous pregnancies) and in placental malaria (overall), but not in anemia/haemoglobin measures.21

We focus here on Lengeler (2004a) because (a) it reviewed more studies; (b) it had a general-population focus and was thus more in line with the programs we seek to evaluate and the effects we seek to assess (particularly the effects on mortality).

## What sorts of programs were carried out in small-scale studies?

We have examined and summarized the papers reviewed in Lengeler (2004a),22 seeking to better understand the basic approaches of the programs that led to the results discussed above. We found:

The details of the programs are often unclear. The programs' approaches varied; most consisted of free ITN distribution, or treatment of existing untreated nets with insecticide (effectively turning untreated nets into ITNs), but some involved promotion/marketing of nets and treatment. All of the studies examining child mortality involved distribution of ITNs to entire communities, not just to children under five. Only two studies distributed ITNs specifically to children under five. In most studies, coverage of ITNs was very low prior to the program (though there was often high coverage of untreated nets), and substantially higher afterward.

Many studies report intensive measures to ensure that people used their ITNs consistently and properly - measures well beyond what we would expect to be feasible in a larger-scale distribution (and well beyond the measures taken by the **Against Malaria Foundation**). Sample quotes:23

"Each village was visited daily by a supervisor who checked the dilution of the permethrin and the progress of the installation." "Care was taken to place the nets over all beds in each selected house." "Mothers of the children in the study cohort were reminded weekly how to use the net. Nets which became torn or damaged were repaired or replaced. A survey was conducted every 4 weeks during the rainy season to determine whether the bed nets had been tucked in and the entry flaps placed correctly." "After distribution, study staff went door-to-door to ensure that nets were hung properly." "At mass meetings of the intervention group males, insecticide dipping procedures and net erection methods were demonstrated...Two months after bed net distribution, the teams revisited the trial families to give further encouragement." Usage does not appear to have been near-universal. Most studies report usage rates in the range of 60-80%, though some report 90%+ usage. Only two studies specifically reported both _reported_ usage and _actual_ usage as determined by surprise visits to homes. In one, actual usage was 70-73% while reported usage was 85%; in the other, actual usage was 85% and reported usage was 97%.24

The author of Lengeler (2004a) has stated to us that few if any randomized controlled trials have been done since this review, and that few are likely to be done, since the efficacy of ITNs is well enough established that such studies could face challenges with ethics boards.25

### How have larger-scale distributions compared to the programs addressed in these studies?

Funding for malaria control has increased substantially since 2004, making a large number of national scale-ups possible.26

As noted above, the studies discussed above may have differed substantially from what can be expected of an "average" ITN distribution. The review author notes this, stating, "the bulk of data in this review describe impact under ideal trial conditions (efficacy) rather than impact under large-scale programme conditions (effectiveness). While the difference between efficacy and effectiveness is likely to be small for certain medical interventions (such as vaccination or surgery), it can potentially be large for preventive interventions such as ITNs."27

In order to get a sense for how the large-scale performance of LLINs has compared with the promise of the smaller-scale studies discussed above, we have asked the following key questions:

1. How have officially delivered LLINs matched up with LLINs confirmed to be in use by actual households?  
2. What has been the general pattern of LLIN usage, i.e., have people used their LLINs?  
3. What has been the connection between LLIN usage and drops in malaria deaths and morbidity?  

We feel that malaria scholars have used reasonably credible data to provide helpful answers to #1 and #2. We feel that #3 is substantially harder to answer due to issues with malaria data and the difficulty of isolating the impact of LLINs, though we have not thoroughly investigated the literature on this topic since 2013. Details follow.

### From LLIN distribution to LLIN ownership

It appears to us that malaria control programs commonly use an "8%-20%-50%" model to estimate the percentage of _distributed_ LLINs that _remain in the field_ years later: they assume that 8% of LLINs distributed 0-12 months ago are no longer in the field (whether because of loss in the process of delivery, falling into disrepair, being given away, etc. ), that 20% of LLINs distributed 12-24 months ago are no longer in the field, and that 50% of LLINs distributed 24-36 months ago are no longer in the field. The very limited evidence we have seen on this topic appears consistent to us with the idea that this model is the best available. Further discussion of this topic is available at another page, for the sake of brevity.

### From LLIN ownership to LLIN usage

We used data from national surveys collected in the WHO World Malaria Report to analyze net usage rates in sub-Saharan Africa. We report results from the 2010 and 2012 editions of the World Malaria Report, which cover different survey years and may use slightly different methodologies (though it is difficult to know from the information available in the reports).28 Our findings are below.

#### 2010 World Malaria Report

In the 2010 World Malaria Report, net usage rates are determined by using national population surveys to compare (a) the percentage of the population that could theoretically be protected by owned ITNs based on an assumption that each ITN protects two people,29 with (b) the percentage of the population that reports using an ITN.30 The 2010 World Malaria Report finds 3 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with greater than 100% apparent usage (this could be a function of more than 2 people covered by each ITN in some cases,31 combined with possible over-reporting of usage in surveys), 2 countries with very low apparent usage (Swaziland, 0%, and Nigeria, 40%), and 7 countries with apparent usage ranging from 69% to 85%.32

#### 2012 World Malaria Report

The 2012 World Malaria Report tabulates results from national population surveys, and compares (a) the percentage of the population that could theoretically have access to an **owned** ITN in their household, assuming that each ITN within a household protects two people and does not protect anyone outside of the household,33 with (b) the percentage of the population that reported **using** an ITN the previous night.34 It finds slightly higher usage rates than the 2010 World Malaria Report. In 17 sub-Saharan African countries that conducted surveys from 2009-2011, the median net usage rate was 91%, with an interquartile range of 82%-98% usage.35

#### Over-reporting

It is possible that survey data overstates usage; in our discussion of small-scale studies **above**, we cite one study where actual usage (as assessed by spot visits to homes) was 70-73% while reported usage was 85%.36 If we assume an equal amount of over-reporting in the national surveys as in the small-scale study, and apply this adjustment to the 2010 World Malaria Report data, actual net usage rates would range from 57% to 73%.37 If this adjustment were applied to the 2012 World Malaria Report data, the interquartile range for net usage rates would be 68% to 84%.38

#### Bottom line

Broadly speaking, the net usage figures implied by surveys gathered in the World Malaria Report are similar to what was found in the small-scale studies discussed above (which had net usage rates generally in the 60%-80% range),39 even after accounting for minor over-reporting. However, this data and our analysis of it could easily be unreliable.40

### From LLIN usage to reduced malaria burden

Funding for malaria control has increased substantially since 2004, making a large number of national scale-ups possible. In 2012-2013, we looked into the question of whether the impact of LLINs on the burden of malaria can be directly seen in available data (outside the context of intensive small-scale studies). Our discussion is on a separate page, for brevity.44 At the time, we concluded that it was difficult to link changes in the burden of malaria to particular malaria control measures. However, we have not revisited this question since 2013 and are aware of recent studies (e.g., Bhatt et al 2015) that assess the large-scale impact of LLINs and conclude that there have been large effects attributable to LLINs.42

## How might the effectiveness of ITNs vary across settings with different malaria transmission patterns? Smithuis et al 2013a raises the possibility that ITNs do not provide consistent protection against malaria in areas with malaria transmission patterns that seem very different than the areas in which the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) works. Smithuis et al 2013a, a study published after the two reviews we discuss (Lengeler 2004a: Gamble, Ekwaru, and ter Kuile 2006), randomly assigned 20 villages (containing a sample of 8,175 children under 10 years old) in Western Myanmar to either a treatment group that received ITNs or a control group.43 The study did not find statistically significant effects of ITNs on malaria infections, spleen rates, hemoglobin concentrations or weight for height over the study period (10 months) and it concluded that ITNs did not provide consistent protection against malaria in the study area. 44 Smithuis et al 2013a does not claim to undermine the evidence of the impact of ITNs in Africa and attributes the lack of an impact in the study to differences in the transmission dynamics for malaria between Africa and Asia.45

The 5 small-scale, high-quality studies that originally established the impact of ITNs on child mortality (see above) all took place in sub-Saharan Africa in areas with stable malaria transmission (we do not know the details of what qualifies malaria transmission as "stable," but the description of malaria transmission in Lengeler 2004a seems to contrast with the "unstable malaria" described in Smithuis et al 2013a).46 As of November 2015, AMF is planning to conduct its major distributions in sub-Saharan African countries. We do not see Smithuis et al 2013a as providing a meaningful update on the potential effectiveness of AMF's activities because (a) AMF works in sub-Sarahan Africa, which we generally expect to have similar transmission dynamics to the 5 studies finding large positive effects of ITNs, and (b) Smithuis et al 2013a does not claim to undermine the evidence of the impact of ITNs in Africa. We do not know if malaria transmission dynamics differ substantially between sub-Saharan African countries or whether they may change over time within sub-Saharan Africa, but we would guess that we would have seen discussion of this topic in our review of the literature on the effectiveness of ITNs if it had been important to the expected effect of ITNs in sub-Saharan Africa.

## Effects on mortality in individuals 5+ years old

We include our analysis of this question on a separate page for brevity. We conclude:

We are aware of three organizations that estimate malaria mortality rates. All of them seem to agree that roughly 25% of all malaria mortality in sub-Saharan Africa occurs among individuals 5+ years old. (For simplicity, throughout this write up we refer to individuals 5 years old and over as "5-and-overs.") We believe that the mechanism by which bed nets would reduce malaria mortality among 5-and-overs is straightforward and plausible: bed nets would reduce malaria cases in this group, which would in turn reduce deaths. We checked this reasoning with three malaria researchers, and they agreed with this assessment. We are not aware of any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that estimate the impact of bed nets on 5-and-over mortality. We have seen one RCT that finds that bed nets reduce 5-and-over malaria episodes. The malaria researchers we spoke to told us that they did not believe there was additional research we missed that directly addresses this question. Given the above, our best guess is that reducing malaria mortality among 5-and-overs is a meaningful impact of bed net distributions, but due to a lack of relevant evidence we are forced to make a variety of judgment calls when estimating the magnitude of this impact in our cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) (see our CEA for more details).

## Possible developmental effects

As noted above, ITN distribution appears to have benefits other than reduced mortality, such as reduced anemia (an effect size larger than what we have seen for **deworming**). In addition, Bleakley 2010 makes a case that reducing the burden of malaria may have a lasting impact on children's development, and thus on their ability to be productive and successful throughout life. Bleakley 2010 analyzes a number of attempts to eliminate malaria in the Americas during the early-to-mid 20th century, focusing on the U.S., Brazil, Columbia, and Mexico. He concludes:

Relative to non-malarious areas, cohorts born after eradication [in malariaous areas] had higher income as adults than the preceding generation. These cross-cohort changes coincided with childhood exposure to the campaigns rather than to pre-existing trends. Estimates suggest a substantial, though not predominant, role for malaria in explaining cross-region differences in income.47

There are good reasons to be cautious in using this study as evidence relevant to ITN distribution:

The programs studied were very different from LLIN distribution campaigns: they focused on indoor residual spraying and other interventions, and did not involve bednets.48

The context was very different from that of modern-day ITN distributions: the campaigns took place in the U.S.A. of the 1920s and Latin America of the 1950s, where the impact of malaria could have been very different from the consequences in the modern-day developing world (and the infections themselves may have been quite different as well). Bleakley 2010 is not an experimental study, but a retrospective one. That is, rather than setting out to answer a question by collecting new data, the author collected and analyzed a large amount of pre-existing data, raising strong possibilities for publication bias. We believe it is unlikely that this paper would have been published in a major economics journal if it had simply concluded that there was no strong evidence for major benefits of malaria eradication. We are generally very hesitant to use papers of this nature in our work. This worry is enhanced by the use of multiple different outcomes and measures of malaria prevalence across the different countries studied, raising the possibility that the author could have selected those specifications that make the outcomes most interesting (in this case, positive for malaria eradication). That said, we believe the paper merits some weight on the question of developmental benefits, because:

GiveWell Senior Advisor David Roodman subjected Bleakley 2010 to intense scrutiny, conducting a detailed review and reanalysis (see blog post here and detailed report here) and concluded: "the campaigns to eradicate malaria from Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, and perhaps the American South as well, were followed by accelerated income gains for people whose childhood exposure to the disease was reduced. The timing of these events is compatible with the theory that rolling back malaria increased prosperity."

It has a plausible strategy for separating the effects of malaria infection from effects of other things (such as poverty) that may correlate with malaria infection. Specifically, it exploits the fact that the eradication campaigns caused a relatively rapid drop in malaria infection rates (which was plausibly exogenous because of technological advancement in the creation of DDT) and that areas with higher initial malaria prevalence saw greater falls in malaria prevalence.49 Thus, it seems possible that a connection between the fall in malaria prevalence and positive life impacts - coinciding with the timing of the campaign - could be attributed specifically to malaria eradication, and not to other factors. It uses graphs to illustrate a relationship between malaria prevalence and later-in-life income that, while varying across countries, shows that the correlation between baseline malaria rates and adult income was negative and fairly constant, then turned into "zero effect" (when adjusted using a set of controls), coinciding well with the timing of the eradication campaign. It seems difficult to explain this pattern except by attributing the change to the drop in malaria prevalence, though it is worth noting that the relationship in Colombia becomes positive, which is unexpected.50

It addresses multiple alternate possible explanations for its observations, including a fairly robust set of controls, though they vary by country (because there is no consistent set of cross-country and cross-time data).51

It covers a number of very large-scale campaigns. While randomized controlled trials allow for a cleaner connection between a program and its effects, a large-scale study like this seems likely to be less dependent on idiosyncratic aspects of a particular mini-program designed to be studied. Bleakley 2010 also finds effects on school enrollment that vary by country.52

## Possible productivity effects

We have seen little evidence that providing ITNs improves short-term productivity (i.e., improvements in productivity through more immediate channels than possible developmental effects).

We know of 2 RCTs examining the effect of ITNs on short-term productivity (Fink and Masiye 2015 and Sedlmayr 2014).53 Fink and Masiye 2015 randomly assigned 516 farmers in Zambia to either a group that received subsidized ITNs, a group that received ITNs for free, or a control group, and found a major potential benefit of ITNs on productivity: it found that free ITNs increased the average annual harvest value for a farmer by $76, about 12% of the group's average annual harvest value at baseline.54 However, baseline imbalance between the treatment and control groups in the outcome of interest poses a major threat to the study's validity.55 We believe that it is difficult to adjust for the potential confounding suggested by this imbalance, so we are hesitant to place much weight on this study's findings.56 We view this study as very weak evidence for the effect of ITNs on productivity. We have not examined Sedlmayr 2014 as closely as Fink and Masiye 2015, but it appears to not have detected an impact of ITNs on productivity.57

## Possible negative/offsetting impact

### Possible development of insecticide resistance. 
There appears to be consensus in the malaria community that the use of LLINs will contribute to the development of insecticide resistance. We discuss this issue in greater depth on a page focused on insecticide resistance. In brief, we feel that resistance is a very serious concern, and would like to see substantially more data available to assess it. It also appears to us that the malaria control community has been devoting attention and investigation to this issue, has developed a reasonable knowledge base (if one that has plenty of room to grow), and still recommends the use of LLINs regardless of the resistance situation. A reasonable summary of the malaria community's perspective is available in notes from our conversation with the WHO's Dr. Abraham Mnzava.

### Possible postponement of human immunity. 
It has been argued that LLINs, by protecting children from mosquitoes, may not only reduce the short-term burden of malaria, but may also reduce opportunities for humans to acquire immunity, making them more susceptible to malaria over the long term.58 A 2010 paper claims that this question has been "answered, with a clear indication that even seven years after initial exposure of infants to ITN, no increased mortality could be observed"59 and cites three sources: Binka et al. 2002, Diallo et al. 2004, and Lindblade et al. 2004. All of these appear to be follow-ups on the small-scale, high-quality studies that originally established the impact of ITNs on child mortality, and all conclude that reductions in child mortality were sustained in the several years after the initial study.60 These follow-ups account for 3 of the 5 studies that originally established an impact of LLINs on child mortality. We have emailed the authors of all five studies to ask whether there have been any follow-ups beyond the latest we're aware of; in 4 of 5 cases, it's been confirmed that no more follow-ups were done, and in the fifth case we have not heard back. A more recent trial, Louis et al. 2012, measured mortality over a median follow-up time of about 8 years in children individually randomized to either receive ITNs at birth or at 6 months of age.61 In line with the follow-ups, the study concluded that ITN protection in early infancy does not increase mortality later in life.62 We attempted to vet the conclusions of one of the follow-ups (Binka et al. 2002), but we found the study difficult to interpret based on the information provided in the paper and our vet was inconclusive.63

### Undermining private markets. 
It is possible that giving away LLINs for free causes people to systematically expect that they will continue to receive LLINs for free, and thus causes people to be unwilling to pay for them. (More at a 2012 blog post.)

### Allergic reactions. 
We have heard anecdotes of minor allergic reactions (e.g., itching skin) to LLINs. We have located no mention of this issue in the Cochrane reviews discussed above and have located very little information on it in general. We did discuss it with program staff during our visit to an ongoing LLIN distribution (we were told that this issue affects few people and can be avoided by letting an LLIN hang for a few days before use). We believe this to be a very minor concern.

Equity concerns. 
It is possible that LLIN distribution may cause conflicts if it is not perceived as fair and equitable. We have seen very little evidence on whether this is an issue. We feel that the Against Malaria Foundation takes appropriate steps to mitigate this concern. Using bed nets for fishing in waterside, food-insecure communities. A New York Times article describes people using insecticide treated bed nets for fishing instead of sleeping under the nets to protect themselves from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. We believe this problem is unlikely to apply to a meaningful portion of AMF's work, and we see it as a much smaller problem than people lacking nets for preventing malaria. For more detail, see our response to the article.

Fire hazard from bed nets. 
Bed nets may pose a fire hazard, because of their flammability.64 Ergot et al 2014 interviewed people about bed net related fires in a district in Benin and conducted a search for studies on bed net related fires.65 The study found reports of bed net related fires in several countries.66 Some of the reported cases resulted in severe bodily harm or death.67 The study found little data on the frequency of bed net related fires.68 Kalanzi et al 2014 examined admissions for bed net related burns to a national referral hospital in Kampala, Uganda.69 The study found 45 patients admitted to the burns unit with bed net related burns from 2008 to 2011.15 of the 45 patients died.70 Hospital data may underestimate the true incidence of bed net related burns if many burn victims don't seek care. From the scant data available, bed net related burns do not seem like a large problem relative to the amount of people using nets.

## Two key issues around LLIN distributions

### Targeted vs. universal coverage

It appears that there has been a shift in emphasis over the last several years from _targeted coverage_ (aiming primarily to cover children under five and pregnant women with ITNs) to _universal coverage_ (aiming to protect everyone in a community with ITNs). The 2004 Cochrane review discussing the impact of ITNs on under-5 mortality (discussed above) appears to advocate primarily for coverage of children under five,71 and as of 2006 this seemed to be the focus of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, and the US President's Malaria Initiative as well.72 However, in 2007 the World Health Organization issued a recommendation for universal coverage that appears to have been an explicit change in position.73 As of 2016, the World Health Organization continues to recommend universal coverage.74

We did a brief investigation of the arguments for targeted vs. universal coverage, because we wondered whether the Against Malaria Foundation's focus on universal coverage was justified. It seemed to us that if the main benefit of ITNs is in reducing mortality for children under five, then targeting children under five could achieve most of the benefits of universal coverage, for a fraction of the cost. On the other hand, there is a potential argument for universal coverage based on the possibility that universal coverage will be more likely to have community-level effects.75

Our investigation consisted of:

Speaking with Christian Lengeler, the author of the Cochrane review of the evidence regarding ITN distribution discussed above. (This Cochrane review appears to us to be the most widely cited evidence of the efficacy of ITNs.76) We have published our notes from this conversation.77

Speaking with two scholars that Professor Lengeler referred us to on this question, Dave Smith and Thomas Smith. We have published notes from each of these conversations.78

Reviewing literature that these scholars referred us to.

Our conclusions are:

The evidence for the efficacy of ITNs in the Cochrane review is based on studies of universal coverage programs, not targeted programs. In particular, all five studies relevant to the impact of ITNs on mortality involved distribution of ITNs to the community at large, not targeted coverage (see above). (We confirmed this in our examination of the individual studies cited in the Cochrane review.79) Thus, there is little basis from the Cochrane review for determining how the impact of ITNs divides between individual-level effects (protection of the person sleeping under the net, due to blockage of mosquitoes) and community-level effects (protection of everyone in communities where ITN coverage is high, due to reduction in the number of infected mosquitoes, caused either by mosquitoes' being killed by insecticide or by mosquitoes' becoming exhausted when they have trouble finding a host). The people we spoke to all believe that the community-level effect of ITNs is likely to be a significant component of their effect, though none believe that this effect has been conclusively demonstrated or well quantified.80

There is some empirical evidence suggesting that the community-level impact of ITNs is significant. We reviewed one study, Hawley et al. 2003, which examined data from a randomized study of ITNs and compared (a) households not selected to receive ITNs but living near other households that had been selected to receive ITNs to (b) households not selected to receive ITNs living far from other households that had been selected to receive ITNs.81 Non-ITN households were divided into quartiles based on proximity to ITN households, and statistically significant trends were observed for child mortality, hemoglobin level and percentage anemic (e.g., non-ITN households showed more favorable performance on these measures as they got closer to ITN households), though the trends were not significant for two other measures of malaria burden.82 For the set of non-ITN households closest to ITN households, malaria outcomes were similar to those for ITN households themselves.83 We find this study credible, although we note that this was a separate analysis of data from a trial of ITN efficacy, so it may be susceptible to publication bias. This study cites eight other studies arguing for significant community-level effects on malaria transmission and one study arguing against this idea. Of these nine, only two (both arguing for community-level effects) examine measures of malaria morbidity/mortality as opposed to simply transmission.84

We have not examined these studies. Counter-evidence comes from the Cochrane review focused on pregnant women (which is not the main one we have discussed):

The most recent trial from western Kenya by Njagi et al. is informative in this respect, as it is the only trial that compared the effects of ITNs versus no nets using simple randomisation by individual in an area with low ITN coverage (little or no mass effect) [24, 29]. This trial and the community-randomised trial by ter Kuile et al. [27] were conducted simultaneously in contiguous areas with similar malaria transmission at baseline, and similar socioeconomic and educational status and ethnicity of the trial population. The effect estimates were similar between the two trials (in women not randomised to IPTp-SP), suggesting that ITNs may work equally well when provided to individuals as part of antenatal care in the second trimester or when provided to entire communities.85

The scholars we spoke with also pointed us to papers attempting to model malaria transmission mathematically. One such paper, Killeen et al.

(2007), that we were pointed to by two of the scholars we spoke to and has been described as a particularly influential paper,86 uses a relatively detailed model of mosquito behavior, which we have not independently vetted and assessed, in order to conclude that "high (80% use) but exclusively targeted coverage of young children and pregnant women (representing <20% of the population) will deliver limited protection and equity for these vulnerable groups. In contrast, relatively modest coverage (35%-65% use, with this threshold depending on ecological scenario and net quality) of all adults and children, rather than just vulnerable groups, can achieve equitable community-wide benefits equivalent to or greater than personal protection."87 Smith et al. (2009) proposes a model for the relationship between ITN coverage and effective protection for the community. This model implies that each incremental increase in ITN coverage is more valuable to the community than the previous increase (e.g., going from 60% to 70% coverage would be more valuable than going from 50% to 60% coverage, which in turn would be more valuable than going from 40% to 50% coverage).88 We asked one scholar whether there were any prominent papers in this category making the opposite argument (that community-level effects are likely to be insignificant) and he replied that he did not know of any.89 We do not find the evidence for community-level impact to be conclusive, but we believe that the best interpretation of the available evidence suggests at least some community-level impacts, consistent with the consensus of the scholars we spoke to and the World Health Organization.

## Free vs. cost-recovering distributions

There has been some debate about whether ITNs should be sold or given freely, with some arguing that selling them (even for highly subsidized prices) may improve the likelihood that they get to people who will use them. We believe that the weight of the (limited) available evidence supports giving out ITNs rather than selling them. Evidence implies that charging a fee has significantly reduced demand for the product, without leading to corresponding increases in utilization rates (and has not significantly impacted the costs of the program).

One high-quality study evaluated the impact of user fees on net purchase and on utilization of the net. A program distributing nets at prenatal clinics in Kenya found that increased prices (from $0 to $0.75, the price at which they were sold) reduced demand by approximately 75%,90 but were not associated with higher rates of utilization.91

A review of high-quality studies on this general issue cites two other studies. One found that charging for deworming drugs significantly reduced demand while raising little revenue and failing to improve the targeting of recipients92; another found that charging for water disinfectant "led to a rapid drop-off in take-up, with no evidence of increased targeting to the most vulnerable" while slightly increasing utilization rates.93

D'Alessandro et al. 1995 reports that individuals in The Gambia given free nets in year one, who were then asked to pay for insecticide to retreat them in year two, saw a significant reduction in coverage and a rise in child mortality.94

Noor et al. 2007 reports that a program in Kenya began selling nets at subsidized prices starting in 2002.95 Net coverage rates remained extremely low, at 25%,96 so in 2004, Kenya sold more heavily subsidized nets.97 In 2006, the program began distributing nets for free,98 raising net coverage to 79% between 2006 and 2007.99

As discussed above, there is a case that ITNs provide community-level protective benefits, so increasing the level of coverage in a community could be beneficial to everyone, not just ITN users. This gives some additional reason for giving out ITNs for free.

## How cost-effective is LLIN distribution? Two general notes on the limitations to cost-effectiveness analysis such as this:

Such analysis will usually draw its main estimates of program effects from small-scale, high-quality studies (our analysis here is no exception). These studies may be unrepresentative of real-world conditions, on account of being carried out in optimal locations and with unusual amounts of funding and intensity. We believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. We provide a spreadsheet100 that estimates the (a) cost per life saved, (b) cost per person protected per year, and (c) cost per child under 14 protected per year (since ITN protection may yield non-mortality-related benefits similar to those of deworming). Our analysis is relatively simplified and unlikely to capture all of the key issues. Some key assumptions and choices made in our model:

We build the model on the Cochrane review's conclusion that each effective year of protection for children under five results in 0.00553 lives saved.101

We include an adjustment to account for the fact that child mortality rates are lower today than they were at the time of the studies on ITNs.102 This adjustment assumes that ITNs avert the same _proportion_ of under-5 deaths that they averted at the time of the studies. This could be incorrect.103

LLINs are assumed to last 2.22 years on average, consistent with the decay model discussed above.104

Our estimate does not include the possible concerns discussed above around negative/offsetting impact (delaying the development of immunity, causing allergic reactions, etc.) with the exception of insecticide resistance. We believe that these are minor concerns. Our estimate does not include all of the possible benefits of malaria control; it focuses on the benefits of saving lives and on possible developmental effects. Other potential benefits including averting malaria morbidity, benefits to the health system of a reduced malaria burden, etc.

#### Bottom line

5/25/2021

LLIN distribution is one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives that we've seen. See our cost-effectiveness models page for the most up-to-date version of our cost-effectiveness analysis of LLIN distribution.

## Is there room for more funding in LLIN distribution?

See the relevant section of our AMF review for the most recent information on the global funding gap for LLINs.

## Our process

### 2013

In 2013, we only conducted further investigation into issues that (a) could significantly affect our perception of the effectiveness of mass distributions of LLINs and that (b) we could reasonably expect to learn more about in a limited amount of time. We conducted further research on the following issues:

Evidence from small-scale, high-quality studies (assessed as up-to-date in September 2013)105

From LLIN distribution to LLIN ownership (assessed as up-to-date in September 2013)

From LLIN ownership to LLIN usage106

From LLIN usage to reduced malaria burden (assessed as up-to-date in September 2013)

Possible negative/offsetting impact (updates to insecticide resistance and delayed immunity only)107

How cost-effective is LLIN distribution2108

Is there room for more funding in LLIN distribution2109

Major questions that may merit further research in the future include:

What is the impact of insecticide resistance on the current effectiveness of LLINs? Do LLINs reduce all-cause mortality for people older than age 5? What is the evidence that LLINs have long-term impacts on children? Has the proportion of deaths averted by LLINs in under-5-year-olds changed over time because of improvements in general health?

### 2014

In 2014, we did not reassess the evidence for LLINs. We only updated the room for more funding section of this page.

### 2015

We investigated a small number of high priority research questions based on our impression of the likelihood that they could substantively change our view of LLINs:

Possible postponement of human immunity. We found Louis et al 2012, a RCT comparing mortality rates in children that received ITNs at birth to children that received ITNs at 6 months of age, and looked more closely at one of the follow-ups of the RCTs that originally established the impact of ITNs on child mortality (Binka et al. 2002). See our discussion in the section here.

**Insecticide resistance**. We only did a cursory review of new literature that might update us on the importance of insecticide resistance. We primarily scanned new literature to see whether there were any studies that directly measured human outcomes (e.g., malaria cases) and found that insecticide resistance potentially led to negative effects on those outcomes (e.g., more malaria cases), but we did not find any such studies. Details on our search for studies are in this footnote.10

**Possible productivity effects**. We found 2 RCTs examining the effect of ITNs on productivity (Fink and Masiye 2015 and Sedlmayr 2014). See our discussion of these studies here. We also searched Google Scholar for well-identified studies on the effectiveness of bed nets.11 In addition to the studies we had already found through our investigation of high-priority research questions, we also found two studies on bed net related burns (Ergot et al 2014 and Kalanzi et 2014), which we discuss here, and a cluster RCT on ITNs in Myanmar (Smithuis et al 2013a and Smithuis et al 2013b), which we discuss here. We also added our response to a New York Times article on the problem of using bed nets for fishing in waterside, food-insecure communities here.

## 2017

In this update, we prioritized reviewing research in two areas that we believed were most likely to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis:

**Effects on mortality in individuals 5+ years old**: we reviewed relevant evidence and spoke with malaria researchers about this topic. We published a new page covering our conclusions.

5/25/2021

Insecticide resistance: we updated our page on this topic but did not significantly change our conclusions since our last update in 2016. See the process section of that page for more details. We briefly reviewed other potentially relevant papers that we became aware of since our last intervention report update. To learn about potentially relevant papers, we have set up Google Scholar alerts so that we are notified when new studies cite the key papers discussed in this intervention report (e.g. **Lengeler 2004a**). We also learn about relevant research papers through a variety of other channels, including speaking with researchers and charities focused on malaria. Finally, we:

Added a reference to GiveWell Senior Advisor David Roodman's analysis of **Bleakley 2010**, a key source on the potential developmental effects of LLINs (see blog post here and detailed report here). Added a note that our analysis of the macro literature on effectiveness of LLINs may be outdated.
