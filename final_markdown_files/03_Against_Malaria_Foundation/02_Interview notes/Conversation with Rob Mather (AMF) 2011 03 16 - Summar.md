**Summary of conversation between Against Malaria Foundation (Rob Mather) and GiveWell (Wendy Knight and Natalie Stone)**

**March 16, 2011**

**Rob Mather told us the following in our call:**

**Post-distribution surveys:**

* AMF's post-distribution surveys non-AMF, in addition to AMF nets, in order to determine future needs.
* Post-distribution surveys ask whether nets are used correctly, with responses being Yes or No. Surveyors ask respondents to demonstrate how they use the nets. If nets are tucked under mattresses with no spaces for mosquitos to get in and there are not large holes (small holes are ok due to presence of insecticide), then the net is considered 'used correctly.' Surveyors assume that all nets in the household are used in the same way the one for which use was demonstrated is--they don't ask respondents to demonstrate multiple nets.
* AMF nets are distinguishable from non-AMF nets by batch number. Also all nets look a little different, at the same time, as more nets are distributed, recognizing nets might become more of an issue. In the past, nets had batch numbers that could be removed, but AMF hopes to remedy this in the future by supplying nets with batch numbers that won't be removed. For future surveys, AMF plans to ask surveyors to confirm that they saw batch numbers.
* The non-AMF nets are generally from national distributions. AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory. AMF also seeks to appeal to community leaders by telling them that if they overestimate, other communities won't get nets.
* AMF believes the randomization of respondents (for post-distribution surveys) is generally well done. In Malawi, for example, surveyors reported picking 5 households from each village by flipping through a beneficiary list and jamming a finger down on a name. AMF seeks to make it clear to distributors that it will not reward them for presenting positive data, that it believes that less positive data indicates honesty. AMF said, "There is the possibility that they would be non-random in order to save time/effort or because they want to present good data. We don't think it's an area of great concern. We are comfortable with what we are getting back."
* Post-distribution surveys have been a part of AMF's long-term goals since the beginning of the organization. AMF wants this information as accountability for donors and to ensure that it is working with partners who have an ongoing commitment and relationship with the community.
* AMF expects to have 100 surveys completed in 3-4 months

* AMF does not have a systematic way to conduct spot checks of data quality, but has worked with volunteers from PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a few checks. In one case in Malawi, AMF was concerned about the delays in receiving data and asked a local hospital director to check things out. She went with three staff and confirmed that the data was accurate.

### Partner ratings:

* AMF is starting to rate partners on "Efficient and easy to work with?" "Did what they said they would do?" and "Timely provision of reports, photos, video." AMF seeks to be as quantitative and transparent as possible with these ratings and uses a series of checklists and time-stamped documents to make the ratings.
* AMF expects to launch this in the next few months
* AMK wants to have a system where partners proactively come back to it and indicate that they have followed up on AMF's suggestions for improvement.
* Anyone who doesn't carry out a post-distribution survey (without very strong justification) would be given a 2-star rating or less and AMF would not work with them again.

### Future of bed net distributions

* Universal coverage in four years time would require distribution of 100s of millions of nets. Funding for nets is coming under pressure and the earthquake/tsunami in Japan could adversely affect this since Japan is a big donor. AMF said, "Now we need to make sure we convert the funding into success and feed data back to funders to demonstrate to people that it continues to be a good investment."
