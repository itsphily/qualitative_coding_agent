## Summary

GiveWell spoke with Mr. Mather and Mr. Sherratt of the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) to get an update on AMF's funding allocation. Conversation topics included AMF's allocation of funds for 2019 distributions and updates to post-distribution monitoring.

### AMF's allocation of funds for 2019 distributions

AMF's allocation of funds for net distributions in 2019 is divided among Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

### Togo

Togo has high rates of malaria prevalence and insecticide resistance (IR). AMF continues to review new information on prevalence and IR in order to develop its strategy, which may include delivering next-generation nets. It believes that other potential funders would not possess the same willingness to procure next-generation nets. Currently, AMF is planning to allocate a fairly small amount of funds to Togo, although it is possible that this amount will increase. _February 2020 update:_ This program was agreed on between AMF and Togo at 3.5 million nets.

### Uganda

The government of Uganda has requested AMF provide up to 14 million nets. After a review of overall net needs and through discussions with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (an expert on IR within Uganda and use of PBO nets), the Ugandan Ministry of Health has requested that the majority of the nets be PBO nets. Uganda demonstrates high rates of IR, and AMF does not believe that an alternative funder would be willing to procure PBO nets. Due to funding needs in DRC, AMF is currently planning to deliver 10 million nets to Uganda, avoiding some lower prevalence areas. However, this decision may leave large areas of Uganda uncovered, and AMF remains concerned with the potential impacts on malaria resurgence and mortality rates in these areas. It is highly likely that AMF's current allocation to Uganda will be finalized; it would not wish to reduce its allocation below 10 million nets. February 2020 update: This program was agreed on between AMF and Uganda at 11.6 million nets. 5 million of these nets are PBOs.

## "Country A"

Country A possesses high and low malaria prevalence areas. The latest report from the President's Malaria Initiative suggests widespread IR in the country. After discussions with the Global Fund, AMF currently believes there is a significant funding gap and is concerned about potential impacts if it were to not provide funding. Furthermore, it believes that its funding will provide an opportunity to prioritize the delivery of nets to high-prevalence areas. AMF is likely to move forward with its allocation of funds. However, various issues need to be resolved, so it is possible that AMF will not provide funding. _February 2020 update:_ Issues remain to be resolved, so AMF has not currently committed nets.

### Drc

DRC has demonstrated very high rates of malaria prevalence. A recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that DRC now represents 11% of the world's malaria burden. AMF has already finalized a commitment of 3.4 million nets to DRC, with the option of providing another 8.4 million (it is extremely likely to provide this second round of funding). It chose this financing structure in order to ensure that the government achieved certain milestones prior to receiving further funding. The two-stage financing was also possible because net distributions in DRC are continuous rather than planned three years in advance. AMF is considering allocating another 7 million nets to DRC, bringing its total commitment to approximately 18 million nets. It believes that investment in accountability and transparency may be particularly important for DRC. _Additional allocations of funding to DRC_

AMF plans to allocate all of its remaining uncommitted funding to work in DRC. It feels secure in making this decision, as its central operating costs are covered for two years, and it receives approximately $350,000 monthly in recurring donations. If issues arise during 2019, such as the need to fund more PBO nets than originally anticipated, AMF will consider them depending on funding then available. If AMF received additional funding from GiveWell, it would allocate all of this funding to work in DRC in 2020. DRC is composed of 26 provinces, each of which typically requires 1.5 to 4 million nets. Depending on the combination of additional GiveWell funding and recurring donations, AMF could either fully fund smaller provinces or co-fund slightly larger provinces with the Global Fund. _February 2020 update:_ AMF continued to allocate funds to DRC. It committed to the 8.4 million nets anticipated above and expanded its program in DRC as it had hoped. AMF committed a further 16.2 million nets, which brought the total to 28 million nets. The early parts of this program have begun and distributions will continue during 2020 and 2021.

### Overall proportion of PBO nets

AMF is not yet certain what proportion of its net allocation will be PBO nets, as the ratio will depend on IR data, costs, and other uncertainties. _February 2020 update:_ AMF continues to assess this data in advance of each net purchase decision. It has recently purchased significant numbers of PBOs for Uganda, Togo and DRC.

### Updates to post-distribution monitoring (PDMs)

#### Change of PDM methodology in Zambia

In Zambia, AMF will now be conducting PDMs at nine-month intervals with a 1.5% sample size, rather than at six-month intervals with a 5% sample size. Its approach in Zambia may change based on forthcoming results from a study in Uganda, which it hopes will provide an understanding of how longer intervals and smaller sample sizes affect PDMs. The first PDM for Zambia is scheduled for completion in February 2019, and the third and last PDM is scheduled for completion in May of 2021. _February 2020 update:_ The first PDM was completed in February 2019.

#### New data collection strategy in Togo

AMF found it highly difficult to identify a low-cost partner for PDMs in Togo. Simultaneously, it decided to pursue a strategy of fully electronic data collection. This will result in missed PDM activities (the first round of data collection is scheduled for March of 2019), although AMF believes this loss is outweighed by the opportunity to build the national Ministry of Health's capacity for large-scale electronic data collection. Although AMF's new strategy has been challenging due to unreliable internet connection as well as lack of expertise and infrastructure, it has found in-country partners to be diligent and cooperative. Government officials from Togo have expressed a willingness and capability to collect large-scale registration and distribution data electronically in 2020. AMF has also established partnerships with L'Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Demographics (INSEED), a Togolese organization with significant experience in data collection with electronic devices, and Le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Paludisme (PNLP), which will be responsible for working with health centers to conduct PDMs. INSEED will monitor the PDM processes carried out by PNLP. _February 2020 update:_ PDMs began in May 2019, carried out by PNLP using electronic devices and independently monitored by INSEED.

**New partnership for PDMs in Papua New Guinea (PNG)**

Due to the challenging landscape in PNG (e.g., some nets are distributed by air), AMF found it difficult to find a partner for PDMs. After speaking with various organizations, it decided to partner with Rotarians Against Malaria (RAM), which is the Global Fund Principal Recipient for work in PNG. Since being designated as such, RAM has had to adjust to distributing larger quantities of nets. However, RAM now has the capacity to conduct PDMs moving forward. AMF's agreement with RAM is largely in place although budgets are still being finalized. _February 2020 update:_ This agreement was finalized with RAM.

**_Timeline_**

The first PDM for the major distribution of nets to PNG in 2017 was missed, but an 18-month and potentially a 27-month PDM will be conducted. AMF believes that skipping the first PDM was justified because the alternative would have been to partner with a different organization and incur significantly higher costs. It plans to conduct nine-month, 18-month, and 27-month PDMs for all 2018 distributions. AMF is highly confident in the quality of PDM data being collected in PNG. _February 2020 update:_ In view of the above considerations, particularly the challenging landscape, AMF decided to conduct PDMs on a 12 and 24 month basis in PNG, and PDMs have begun. This frequency remains under review.

**Collaboration with IDinsight**

IDinsight has provided AMF with a list of recommendations on how it could improve PDM methodology. AMF is moving forward with at least 12 of the recommendations, and although it does not believe that these changes represent a large methodological shift it values the IDinsight work. AMF has delayed documentation of progress with IDinsight's recommendations due to other time-sensitive matters. _February 2020 update:_ AMF has provided GiveWell with a list of IDinsight's recommendations that it has implemented.

#### Collaboration on data quality assurance

At AMF's request, IDinsight created a list of recommendations surrounding AMF's data quality assurance activities. _All GiveWell conversations are available at_
