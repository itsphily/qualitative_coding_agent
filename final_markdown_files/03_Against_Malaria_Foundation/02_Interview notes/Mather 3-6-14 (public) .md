GiveWell spoke with Rob Mather about the Against Malaria Foundation's (AMF) progress in finalizing net distributions, its ongoing evaluation of past distributions, and its current funding situation. **Ongoing negotiations**

AMF is currently in serious discussions with several countries about potential distributions. AMF has decided to not share the details of these discussions (e.g., the names of the countries, specific issues under discussion, and likely size of the distribution) publicly before they are finalized because doing so could be reduce the likelihood that it is able to reach an agreement. It plans to maintain its high level of transparency about distributions once agreements have been reached. Note: GiveWell doesn't find this position to be cause for concern. Some specific points of interest:

* AMF expects that its future distributions will have the same level of monitoring and evaluation as its past distributions. It does not perceive this to be a bottleneck in reaching agreement.
* AMF has decided not to seek additional monitoring related to insecticide resistance. Doing so would require additional funding and partnership with/engagement from academics, and AMF prefers to finalize distributions before incorporating this into its distributions. **Monitoring and evaluation of past distributions**

AMF is in the process of receiving data from the 24-month post-distribution survey for its early-2012 Ntcheu, Malawi distribution. Data is still being entered, but thus far, net use appears to be strong (i.e., approximately 80% of nets distributed still hung and in good condition 24 months after the distribution). AMF has continued to collect malaria case rate data from Ntcheu. It intends to post an update on its perspective about this data at the end of March. **AMF's funding situation**

AMF holds approximately $14.5 million. Were it to finalize the large distributions it is currently negotiating, it projects facing a shortfall of approximately $5 million. Because of this possible shortfall, it is not currently aiming to add potential distributions to its queue, and is waiting to see whether these distributions are finalized. AMF expects to have further visibility into these distributions and its funding needs within the next month. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_
