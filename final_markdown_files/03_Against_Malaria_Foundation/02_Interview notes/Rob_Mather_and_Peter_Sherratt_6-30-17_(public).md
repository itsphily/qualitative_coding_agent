**Note:** These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Mr. Rob Mather and Mr. Peter Sherratt. **Summary**

GiveWell spoke with Mr. Mather and Mr. Sherratt of the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF). Conversation topics included the recent distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets [LLINs] in Uganda, brief updates on several other countries, and plans for future distributions. ** Uganda**

The most recent data suggest that the number of nets required is about 30% higher than estimated. Consequently, the government has requested an additional four million nets, which would cost about $15 million (including non-net costs). The cause of this discrepancy is not entirely clear, but there are several reasons to believe it is due to inaccurate population estimates rather than misallocated nets. For example, AMF's representative in Uganda, David Masiko, did not find any irregularities when he spot-checked the data; and figures from the official 2014 census are known to have significantly underestimated the population. AMF and other funders are considering an independent audit. This will include an examination of the existing data for signs of fraud, and visits to 20 randomly-selected villages: 10 in the Eastern Region and 10 in the Western Region. In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location. This net shortfall also has ramifications for the planned study on PBO LLINs. However, AMF is confident that the challenges can be overcome so that the study can proceed.

### Other locations

#### Nord-Ubangi, Democratic Republic of the Congo

The six-month post-distribution check-up of net use and condition (PDCU) had to be abandoned due to violence. The 12-month PDCU has been completed and almost all of the data have been entered into AMF's data entry system. Early indications are that it went well. AMF did the randomization and provided the list of which households to visit.

#### West Kasai, Democratic Republic of the Congo

A UNICEF-funded distribution will be carried out here so the planned 30-month PDCU will probably not take place.

#### Malawi

PDCUs are ongoing and all new data are being entered into AMF's data entry system (DES).

#### Ghana

The PDCUs are going smoothly.

#### Togo and Zambia

The LLINs should arrive in about a month. The current focus is on establishing data entry centers.

#### Papua New Guinea

Data are being entered at a rate of about one province per month. This is all being done through Rotary International.

#### Future distributions

Requests for LLINs are far in excess of AMF's funding, and many countries. AMF expects to make some major funding decisions by the end of September 2017. The target date for new distributions is 2019-2020, in some cases distributions may be as soon as late 2018. AMF is actively exploring the possibility of further distributions in DRC. AMF met with the head of DRC's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and the Global Fund to get more information on the gaps in LLIN provision, which are large (tens of millions of nets).
