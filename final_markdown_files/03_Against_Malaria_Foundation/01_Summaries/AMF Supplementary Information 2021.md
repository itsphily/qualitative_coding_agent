# Registration process

Section last updated: November 2018, except where otherwise noted

Malawi

In November 2018, AMF sent us a document explaining its current process in Malawi, which is available as **AMF Malawi Registration Process 2018**. The rest of this section details our understanding of registrations AMF has conducted in Malawi in recent years. United Purpose (formerly Concern Universal), AMF's partner in Malawi, collects data from each household on the number of sleeping spaces. In the past, it also collected data on the number of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) that have at least one year of remaining use, but going forward it will not be taking existing LLINs into account.1 Our understanding of the pre-distribution registration survey (PDRS) process is as follows:2

United Purpose collects demographic data from the district health office, including the number of households in the region and the number of people per household.

United Purpose briefs the health facility supervisor (HSA), who will do the door-to-door surveying, about the PDRS. There are no detailed maps or geographical information system data for rural Malawi, so United Purpose and HSAs rely on traditional authorities and community leaders to locate all the households in the targeted villages. HSAs go door-to-door to register all households in the targeted villages. A village leader or other volunteer accompanies the HSA during this process. During household registration: the volunteer and HSA introduce themselves to the head of the household and explain why they are there. The HSA obtains permission to enter the household from the household head. (The difficulty of obtaining this permission varies based on the local culture. Local leaders can lend credibility to the HSA when asking for permission to enter a household.) Once in the household the HSA collects information including the name of the head of the household and the number of sleeping spaces. (The HSA asks household members for demographic information, and assesses the number of sleeping spaces via visual inspection. United Purpose conducts "105%" data verification during the PDRS. HSAs are responsible for registering 100% of households in a village. In addition, supervisors independently register 5% of households in each village during the PDRS. This data is later compared to the HSA-collected data to check for consistency. Note that in September 2016, AMF told us that this piece of the process has not been emphasized and may not be happening consistently. The only data we have seen from the 5% checks from any AMF distributions is partial data from from the Balaka 2015 distribution.3

United Purpose staff and government health officials supervise the registration. We are not sure what this involves in practice. We have seen pre-distribution survey results from all of AMF's completed large-scale distributions in Malawi: full data from its Ntcheu 2012, Balaka 2015, and Ntcheu 2015 distributions; and sample results from its Balaka 2013, Dedza 2014, Dowa 2015 distributions.4

## Drc

IMA World Health, AMF's partner in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), used different registration processes for the two distributions it has completed (in Kasai-Occidental and Nord Ubangi). For the Kasai-Occidental distribution, IMA World Health concurrently collected registration data on smartphones, distributed LLINs, and hung LLINs in recipients' homes. IMA World Health collected registration data on the number of sleeping spaces and previously-owned nets in usable condition in each household, and allocated enough LLINs to cover all sleeping spaces, minus the number of existing, usable nets. GPS coordinates identifying the location of the household and data on the number of AMF's LLINs hung up during the distribution process were also collected. We have seen full registration data from Kasai-Occidental.5

In Nord Ubangi, DRC, registration data was also collected on smartphones, but it was collected prior to the distribution rather than during it. IMA World Health collected registration data on the number of sleeping spaces and previously-owned nets in usable condition in each household, and allocated enough LLINs to cover all sleeping spaces, minus the number of existing, usable nets. GPS coordinates identifying the location of the household and data on the number of AMF's LLINs hung up were also collected. We have seen sample registration data from Nord Ubangi.6

## Ghana

### Sub-section last updated: November 2017

In Ghana, volunteers organized by one of AMF's distribution partners, Ghana Health Services (the National Malaria Control Program is a part of Ghana Health Services), collected information on the number of people in each household prior to the distribution.

Households were allocated one net per two people (rounding up for households with an odd number of people). Previously-owned nets in usable condition were not taken into account when allocating LLINs.7

AMF has shared all registration data collected from each of the three regions it has funded distributions in with us.8

## Uganda

AMF's distribution partners in Uganda collected information on the number of people in each household prior to the distribution. Data on the number of existing usable nets in each household were not recorded in AMF's Data Entry System, so we assume these data were not collected.9

We have seen data down to the household level on the distribution in Uganda. AMF has also shared distribution reports from three of the four waves of the distribution that have occurred in Uganda.10 Based on our review of these distribution reports, the registration process used in Uganda appears to be broadly similar to that used in Malawi and Ghana. One report indicates that registration did not occur in at least some areas; we are uncertain how widespread this issue was.11

AMF told us that verification data (i.e. data from different surveyors re-surveying of 5% of households to check the quality of the initial round of surveys) were collected:12 we have not yet seen them. One of the distribution reports we have seen suggests that verification may have largely taken place in convenient-to-reach villages.13

## Papua New Guinea

We have seen several distribution reports from Papua New Guinea. Based on our review of these distribution reports, the registration process used in Papua New Guinea appears to be broadly similar to that used in Malawi and Ghana. Rotary Club of Port Moresby (RCPM)/Rotarians Against Malaria, AMF's distribution partner in Papua New Guinea, collected data on the number of people in each household prior to the distribution. AMF told us that data were not collected on the number of existing LLINs in each household;14 we have seen these data for individual households.15

According to the reports we received, as a means of ensuring all households had been registered, a summary of every village surveyed is posted for 24 hours in a public place so that people can ensure that all their family members have been included in the survey. Prior to AMF's involvement, registered household information was read aloud at a village meeting. Additionally, AMF has told us that different surveyors re-survey a randomly-selected 6% of households in every village to verify the collected information;16 we have not seen data from this process.

### Togo

The registration process used in Togo appears to be broadly similar to that used in Malawi and Ghana. More information can be found in the distribution report we have received from Togo; see footnote.17 Upon registering, households were issued coupons redeemable for LLINs.18 Supervisors revisited a subset of households to verify the data collected.19

After registration, a "rapid evaluation" was conducted, revisiting 800 households and asking whether they were visited by a surveyor and whether they received a coupon for LLINs. We do not have much information about the robustness of this process, which found generally very positive results.20

## Zambia

The registration process used in Zambia appears to be broadly similar to that used in Malawi and Ghana, based on the information in the distribution reports we have received from Zambia (see footnote).21

## Distribution process

# Malawi

In Malawi, Concern Universal uses the following process for its distributions:#2

After information is collected and verified, Concern Universal creates a distribution planning document which: Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc. Allocates a number of nets to be delivered to each location. Concern Universal staff then meet with traditional authorities and district health officials to explain the distribution plan and set a date for the distribution, avoiding days that conflict with other community events. Concern Universal communicates the date, time, and place of distributions verbally to village leaders, who relay the information verbally to village members. On distribution day, Concern Universal staff bring bed nets to the distribution sites using Concern Universal's vehicles or vehicles rented for that purpose. Village members typically walk to the distribution site; some travel by bike or organize transit in a motor vehicle. At the site, village leaders and HSAs group the beneficiaries by village. A roll call is taken, and as household names are called, members approach to receive nets. Household heads sign or fingerprint two copies of the distribution register to confirm receipt of their nets. If the household head is not present, a representative may receive nets on his/her behalf, as long as that person is recognized by the village head as being part of the household. When distribution is complete, each village leader receives a copy of the distribution register for their village, and Concern Universal retains the other copy. "An example of managing in-country shipping and storage logistics from the 2014 Dedza distribution (our understanding is that Concern Universal has used similar processes for its other distributions in Malawi):23

"Upon arrival in-country and after completing all custom clearance formalities, the nets were stored in the main warehouse located within the premises of the District Hospital in Dedza Town pending relocation to the respective Health Centres[...] In order to ensure the security of nets, new padlocks were installed on all warehouse doors and the keys kept by CU's storekeeper. Comprehensive insurance was contracted to cover potential losses caused by theft, fire or water damage and security guards were deployed throughout the distribution period, until all nets were distributed. All movements of nets were supervised by at least two CU staff members and the security guard[...] One or two days prior to distribution, the required quantity of nets was ferried to the health center for temporary safe keeping pending relocation to the distribution points on the day of distribution. Two vehicles were used to carry the distribution personnel and nets."

## Drc

In Kasai-Occidental, DRC, IMA World Health implemented registration and hang-up distribution at the same time.

The following bullet points are a summary of the distribution process (more details in full distribution report).24

"Nets arrived in Kinshasa on 22 Jul 2014 in 21 x 40HC shipping containers each containing approximately 32,000 nets." Pg 5. "The nets travelled 800 kms by road over the next three days and arrived in Tshikapa District with individual trucks driving directly to eight individual locations in each of the Health Zones where the relevant quantity of nets needed for the distribution in that district were pre-positioned." Pg 6. "Meetings were held with local leaders to seek permission and support for the distribution." Pg 12. "Two categories of staff were required for the distribution. Field Supervisors (FSs), who had a management responsibility in each HA, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) who were responsible for visiting beneficiary households to collection registration information, hand out and hang the nets." Pg 12. "The CHW responsible for the hanging of the nets does so with the help of the head of household and/or other household members, using the string and nails brought along if necessary. A net is hung over each sleeping space (two people per sleeping space) and then rolled up out of the way (for example off the ground) during the day to help avoid unnecessary wear and tear or damage. It is then rolled down at night." Pg 17. In Nord Ubangi, DRC, IMA World Health's distribution process was more similar to distributions in Malawi, with the separation of registration and distribution processes and the use of point distribution.25

" Differences [between the Nord Ubangi distribution and the Kasai-Occidental 2014 distribution]

The North Ubangi distribution will be a two-phase distribution - a distinct pre-distribution phase and a subsequent distribution phase. In West Kasai establishing net need per household and distributing of nets was contemporaneous. Distribution of nets will be done from distribution points rather than at the household

The ODK registration form has been re-designed to better capture the required data, to eliminate some types of error and to reduce the chance of others. Operational lessons learned from the West Kasai distribution will be implemented. An experienced, full time technology manager has been employed by IMA meaning there will be more extensive and easier liaising with AMF on data elements of the distribution. We have met the new technology manger and have spent a week working with him and are impressed. Similarities [between the Nord Ubangi distribution and the Kasai-Occidental 2014 distribution] [...] The same smartphone-based data collection technology will be used as in West Kasai. [...]

IMA has agreed there are benefits to conducting a separate, earlier pre-distribution phase during which accurate household-level net need is established. IMA are less able to estimate accurately population and net need in North Ubangi compared to what they felt was possible in West Kasai. IMA believes point distributions rather than at-household distribution will be more cost-effective." 

## Ghana

We have learned about the distribution processes for AMF's three distributions in 2016 in Ghana through conversations with AMF's distribution partners in Ghana (including the Greater Accra Regional Health Directorate of the Ghana Health Service, which managed in-country shipping and storage logistics for LLINs). From GiveWell's notes from a site visit to a bed net distribution program funded by the Against Malaria Foundation in Greater Accra, Ghana, August 15-18, 2016:

" Steps in the distribution process Beneficiaries walk a short distance to their distribution point. One Community Health Officer (CHO) employed by GHS and one GHS volunteer are stationed at each distribution point; there are never just two GHS volunteers.

Before giving out each net, the distributors rip the packaging to help prevent reselling. Distributors gather together groups of recipients in order to transmit educational messages. The nets are distributed. Distributors make sure the recipients' coupons (brought by recipients) match the registration copies (brought by distributors) and make a mark on each side. The recipient's coupon is returned to them. Distributors also have a tally sheet with rows of 5 bubbles, and mark off a bubble for every net they give out. Distributors do not have an opportunity to sit or take a lunch break during distribution days. [..] When deciding where to locate distribution points, the Greater Accra GHS considered safety, costs (for example, the cost of renting a warehouse) and proximity to other distribution points. They also selected 12-13 pre-positioning points in each distribution area. " 

### Papua New Guinea

_Sub-section last updated: November 2017_

In the 2017 distribution in Papua New Guinea, Rotarians Against Malaria distributed nets using the following process (more details in footnote):26

Nets were allocated to each family based on household survey data:

" Following the survey, all data was entered into a computer where possible or entered into a master sheet of the area concerned. For each village, nets were allocated to each family on a needs basis and this is also entered into the computer or master sheet. This process ensured that all villages received nets and that there would be no shortfalls. " Communities were informed that the distribution teams would be arriving:

" There was no official launch for the LLINs distribution. However, prior to distribution there was a social awareness phase where the project teams informed communities about the arrival of the distribution teams, especially those accessible by road." Nets were distributed from a central location in a village or ward:

" The LLINs were then distributed to teams depending on the needs of each village. The LLINs were then distributed by village or wards depending on whether villages were close together. In this latter case, a central location was identified in the ward and distribution of nets was carried out. In terms of distribution sites, villages were organised in different ways to make the flow of nets easy and effective. However, the actual organisation depended on each team and the structure of the various groups receiving nets." Rotarians Against Malaria's description of the day of the distribution:

"Wait for everyone to come to the distribution site, collect all the white copies [of the vouchers given during the household survey] and sort the copies with the pink copies. Call the names on the white copies and give the nets. [...] Everyone who presented with a white copy was given LLINs at the distribution site with LLINs only given to the owner of the house or a member of the house whose name is written on the back of the survey form. Those people who lost the white receipts were left to the end of each distribution, with nets only being issued if the name of the person collecting the nets was on the back of the pink copies. For those families who were absent at the time of distribution, their names were written in a form - MOSQUITO NETS HELD IN TRUST BY VILLAGE CHIEFS FORM and the nets allocated to missing families were given to chiefs or any person entrusted by the community with the forms for these families to collect their LLINs later. Householders are now being asked to make a thumb print as proof of delivery of nets to a household. The Global Fund had formally asked that households should sign for delivery of nets. This was considered problematic as many householders are illiterate and even where householders can write, this process takes a long time in what is often a very chaotic and charged environment where speed is of the essence." Surveys and distributions took place at the same time in some villages that are particularly difficult to reach:27

" It should also be noted, that due to the very remote locations found in some LLGs of the province, surveys and distributions took place at more or less the same time in some places. This is particularly true for mountainous villages or small islands which might take several hours or days to reach. In these instances, estimations based on the 2000 Census data and local knowledge to pre-allocate nets to these areas. Teams were then dispatched to these areas with nets. On arrival in these remote places, surveys took place and were immediately followed by a distribution based on the survey results." 

# Monitoring overview

###### Abstract

AMF's distribution partners also implement a set of monitoring activities to produce evidence on whether the registration and distribution processes operated as intended and on the long-term impact of the LLIN distribution. Monitoring activities have varied somewhat for different distributions. Process monitoring (i.e., the activities used to assess whether the registration and distribution processes operated as intended):

Data validation: In Malawi, AMF's distribution partner Concern Universal provides registration lists to community leaders who read the lists out loud at a community meeting, supervised by Concern Universal, so community members can request edits.28 AMF told us that in Kasai-Occidental, DRC, its partner IMA World Health employed supervisors who checked data for obvious errors and compared electronic and paper records. AMF has also checked the registration and distribution data for missing or inconsistent household-level records.29 We have not yet seen details of what data validation processes were used in Nord Ubangi, DRC. In Ghana, several different processes were used to validate data collected during registration and distribution: "pre-distribution data validation" (comparing the number of LLINs allocated to each community based on registration data to what would be expected based on the most recent census data, and double-checking and correcting--by phone or a follow-up household visit--the source of implausible registration data, e.g., households with more than 20 members), "post-distribution data validation" (checking whether data collected during the distribution indicates that households received appropriate numbers of LLINs), and, to check the accuracy of the electronic input of registration and distribution data, "6% data entry validation" (independent re-entering of 6% of the data collected during registration and distribution and checking it against the original electronic records). Details in footnote.30

"Embedded" monitoring

In the 2016 LLIN distributions in Ghana, AMF's non-profit distribution partners, Episcopal Relief & Development and the Anglican Diocesan Development and Relief Organization (ADDRO), monitored the implementation of the registration and distribution processes by AMF's government distribution partner, Ghana Health Services. Episcopal Relief & Development and ADDRO were "embedded" in the registration and distribution processes; they attended district-level planning meetings to ensure that they were operating as intended, observed the registration of households by volunteers organized through Ghana Health Services, and observed selected distribution points (details in footnote).31 There was no "embedded" monitoring in AMF's distributions in Malawi and DRC since AMF worked with a single non-profit partner for those distributions. Distribution reports: Distribution reports provide narrative summaries of activities implemented and challenges encountered by distribution partners. Concern Universal has provided distribution reports for four of the six large-scale distributions it has completed in Malawi,32 IMA World Health has provided a distribution report for the Kasai-Occidental, DRC 2014 distribution.33 We have not yet seen a distribution report from the Nord Ubangi, DRC distribution, which was completed in May 2016. From the three distributions in Ghana in 2016, we have seen a full distribution report from Episcopal Relief & Development from the Northern Region distribution, and short-term "Activity Reports" covering some periods of the pre-distribution and distribution activities in Greater Accra and the Upper West Region.34 It is our understanding that full distribution reports will be available for the Greater Accra and Upper West distributions later.

**Post-distribution validation tracing:** After distributions were complete, AMF's distribution partners in Ghana checked that a random sample of households (100 households per district) had actually received the number of LLINs they were allocated by calling or visiting the households.35 Episcopal Relief & Development noted that, through this process, it discovered that a significant number of residents of two districts in Greater Accra, Ghana had not picked up the LLINs they had been allocated; we have not seen results beyond that.36 It is our understanding that similar processes have not been used in AMF's distributions in Malawi and DRC. **Impact monitoring** (i.e., the activities used to assess the long-term impact of the distribution):

**Post-distribution check ups** (PDCUs):

Distribution partners conduct follow-up surveys (called post-distribution check-ups, or PDCUs) in 5% of households at 6-month intervals for 2.5 years after a distribution. PDCUs estimate the presence, usage, and condition of LLINs from the AMF-funded distribution (details **below**). We summarize which PDCUs have been completed and whether they were completed on time in **this spreadsheet** (see "PDCUs" sheet), and summarize the results of PDCUs we have seen in **this spreadsheet**. Most scheduled PDCUs have been completed in Malawi. In 2016, AMF published data and reports from its first two PDCUs from Kasai-Occidental, DRC, its first PDCUs completed outside of Malawi.37 We believe these PDCUs were poorly implemented and do not provide an accurate estimate of the proportion of AMF's LLINs that reached their intended destinations or the impact of AMF's distribution on LLIN usage over time in Kasai-Occidental (see this blog post for details). PDCUs from Ghana are expected later. **Malaria case rate data:** Previously, AMF expected to collect data on malaria case rates from the regions in which it funded LLIN distributions: in the distribution agreements for several Malawi distributions, AMF asked Concern Universal to provide monthly malaria case rate data from before and after the distributions from all health centers in the three districts.38 In 2016, AMF shared malaria case rate data from Malawi covering January 2010 through March 2015 for Balaka, N tcheu, and Dedza, and for Dowa from July 2012 to March 2015, but we have not prioritized analyzing it closely.39 AMF believes that this data is not high quality enough to reliably indicate actual trends in malaria case rates, so we do not believe that the fact that AMF collects malaria case rate data is a consideration in AMF's favor, and do not plan to continue to track AMF's progress in collecting malaria case rate data.40

In previous versions of our review of AMF, we noted that AMF used "105%" registration data collection in some distributions. For distributions with "105%" registration data collection, after staff or volunteers have collected registration data from households, a different group of staff or volunteers revisit 5% of households and independently collect registration data.41 We do not believe this process, as it has been carried out, has been a useful form of monitoring. AMF and its partner in Malawi, Concern Universal, have not matched the two sets of registration data in time to correct potential errors in the distribution process (e.g., distributing the incorrect number of LLINs to a particular household). We have seen the 5% registration check data from one distribution in Malawi which AMF partially matched to the original data several months after the distribution was completed,42 and AMF has told us that 105% registration data was collected for other Malawi distributions but that it has not prioritized analyzing it.43 AMF has told us it sees the primary purpose of 105% data collection as being a tool to motivate data collectors, and that it does not need to check the data to achieve that goal.44

In previous versions of our review of AMF, we also discussed AMF's use of photos and videos as evidence that nets had reached their intended destinations. Because AMF has told us that it does not now consider photo and video footage part of its monitoring and evaluation activities, and because photos are missing for many recent distributions and there are fairly small numbers of photos available for other distributions, we no are longer tracking whether AMF is collecting photos and videos from distributions.

### PDCU process

_Section last updated: November 2016_

"Post-distribution Check-Ups (PDCUs) are carried out every 6 months for 2.5 years (so 5 checks) with 5% of households in each Health Area selected at random and visited unannounced. These data are put in electronic form. "45

## Malawi

AMF and Concern Universal are in the process of revising the methodology used for PDCUs in Malawi. Concern Universal previously used the following procedure for its PDCUs:46

From a list of all villages that received nets in a distribution, Concern Universal's project manager arbitrarily picks 5% of the villages to carry out PDCUs in. For each PDCU, the project manager tries to not select villages that are geographically close to each other or villages that have been visited in the previous PDCU. (Note that this selection procedure is not random and may be subject to bias.) For each selected village, the project manager arbitrarily selects 25 households to be surveyed during the PDCU. (Note that this selection procedure does not appear to be random and may be subject to bias.) On the dates of the PDCU, a supervisor or HSA from the local health facility accompanies the enumerator (a contracted employee of Concern Universal) to the village being surveyed. The HSA and enumerator meet with the village leader to discuss the purpose of their visit. The health facility staffer and enumerator arrive at the village unannounced to avoid knowledge of the PDCU influencing beneficiary behavior. The village leader (or a representative of the village leader) then accompanies the enumerator and health facility staffer to each household selected for the PDCU. The village leader knows the location of each selected household, and introduces the household head to the PDCU team. The household head gives consent for the PDCU team to enter the household and perform its check. If a household head refuses, the enumerator informs the project manager and the project manager selects another household. If the household head is away when the PDCU team arrives, the enumerator will return later in the day to perform the check. Household heads are frequently away when the PDCU team arrives, often because they are doing fieldwork far from their home. During the PDCU check, the enumerator:

assesses the number of regularly used sleeping spaces.
asks how many people are in the household, and how many have had blood-diagnosed malaria in the past month.
checks the brand of the bed nets. Nets are recorded either as 'Permanet,' 'Olyset' (the two brands AMF distributes), or 'other.'
records whether the net was distributed by an AMF-funded distribution. AMF-funded nets have a tag with the AMF logo and the date of the distribution.
assesses the net condition. Nets are assessed as 'very good,' 'okay,' or 'poor.' A net in very good condition has two or fewer holes of less than 2 cm. A net in okay condition has fewer than 10 small holes (less than 2 cm). A net in poor condition has more than 10 small holes, or one large hole (greater than 10 cm). Net quality is assessed by physical examination by the enumerator. If a net is not hung, the net is unfolded and physically assessed.
asks who sleeps under each net, categorized by children under 5, children ages 6-18, pregnant women, or other people.
asks how many nets were originally distributed to the household during the AMF distribution, and also notes how many of these nets are not present, or worn out.
records how many nets in the household are hung, and how many are not hung.
assesses whether nets are being used correctly. For this assessment, the enumerator makes a judgment call about whether the nets are being used properly. Often, nets will not be hung during the day due to limited space, but still may be used properly at night.

## Ghana

Episcopal Relief & Development agreed to carry out post-distribution check-up surveys for the three distributions in Ghana in 2016.47

AMF has told us that, for the first PDCU for the Northern Region in Ghana in November 2016, there will be "5% of the 5%" data collection--a separate set of data collectors re-visiting a random selection of 5% of the households selected for the PDCU to re-collect data. AMF also told us that it expects to be able to quickly match the "5% of the 5%" data to the original PDCU data, and intends to use this check to assess the accuracy of PDCU data collection.48

## PDCU definitions

### Section last updated: November 2016

The following definitions are based on our understanding from multiple sources and may not have been used fully consistently for each post-distribution survey (PDCU). Definitions:

_Nets hung:_ AMF told us that interviewers are asked to observe whether nets are hung by entering interviewees' houses (rather than simply asking interviewees if they are hung). Concern Universal told us that PDCU surveyors use their judgment to assess whether nets are being hung properly when they are interviewing recipients and inspecting their nets and sleeping spaces.49 It is our understanding that none of the nets included in the "nets hung" category are "worn out" (i.e., all are in "viable", "good", or "very good" condition).50

"Very good" condition: LLIN has fewer than 2 holes of less than 2 cm in size.51

"Good" condition: LLIN has fewer than 10 small holes.52

"Viable" condition: LLIN has more than 10 small holes or has one large hole.53

"Worn out": Survey reports from Concern Universal did not provide a definition of this term. AMF has told us in the past that an LLIN is considered worn out if it has multiple large holes and the LLIN is unrepairable, such that it would not provide protection against mosquitoes.54

Used correctly: According to a survey form from 2012, interviewers are asked to "ask the householder to demonstrate how the nets are used at night" and to then select yes or no to the question "are the nets being used correctly."55 In 2014, AMF told us that the procedure had not changed in more recent surveys.56

Note that some of the nets included in this category may not be AMF nets and that it is possible that some "used correctly" nets are also "worn out" nets.57 In this blog post, we discuss the possibility of bed nets being used for other purposes than covering sleeping spaces (e.g., being used as fishing nets). We have not seen evidence that AMF-distributed nets are being misused at a meaningful scale, and the PDCU results we have seen to date indicate that, at least in Malawi, a large majority of AMF-distributed nets are being used appropriately. _People covered by nets:_ We are unsure of how to interpret this metric. We previously believed that this included all people who sleep under a properly hung and not worn out net. However, the data for some post-distribution check-ups is not consistent with this interpretation.

## What's included in our cost per LLIN estimates

The estimate for completed distributions in Malawi uses:59

The purchase price per LLIN, calculated from AMF's total LLIN budget and the number of LLINs distributed.
Actual costs for five completed large-scale distributions in Malawi as reported by Concern Universal60 and a combination of budgeted and actual costs for post-distribution check-up surveys following these distributions.61 AMF told us that the non-net budgets include all monetary costs incurred by Concern Universal, as well as the use of vehicles and managerial staff time;62 they may exclude non-monetary costs such as the use of office space.

An estimate of non-monetary costs incurred by Concern Universal and local governments, based on estimates provided in 2012 by Concern Universal for its distribution in Ntcheu province.63

A calculated estimate of the non-monetary costs incurred by Concern Universal and local governments due to post-distribution check-ups (calculated based on the Ntcheu 2012 estimate discussed above).64

An estimate of AMF's organizational costs per net, including an estimate of the value of donated services and volunteer time. Because these costs generally do not vary with the number of LLINs distributed and remain roughly constant on a per year basis, the per LLIN estimate is highly dependent on the time period used and the number of LLINs distributed in that period. We estimate AMF's organizational costs as $0.29 per LLIN for July 2011 through the beginning of October 2016.65

For DRC, the estimate is rougher. We constructed the estimate similarly, although the information we have for DRC is likely of lower quality.66 The estimate for the DRC is based on:67

The purchase price per LLIN, calculated from AMF's total LLIN budget and the number of LLINs distributed. Actual costs for the Kasai-Occidental 2014 and Nord Ubangi 2015 distributions. Actual costs for the first three post-distribution check-ups following the Kasai-Occidental 2014 distribution, an estimate of the costs of the remaining Kasai-Occidental post-distribution check-ups based on the costs of the completed post-distribution check-ups, and budgeted costs for the post-distribution check-ups for the Nord Ubangi 2015 distribution. The same estimate of AMF organizational costs as we used for Malawi. Calculated estimates of non-monetary costs incurred by IMA World Health and local governments, based on the estimate from the 2012 distribution in Ntcheu, Malawi.68

The higher cost per net in the DRC may be explained by a considerably more difficult operating environment in DRC,69 or our data for DRC may simply be of lower quality. The estimate for Ghana is also rough; it is based on:70

The purchase price per LLIN, calculated from AMF's total LLIN budget and the number of LLINs distributed. Budgeted costs for pre-distribution, distribution, and post-distribution activities (primarily monitoring activities, including post-distribution check-ups) from AMF's non-profit distribution partner in Ghana, Episcopal Relief & Development.71

A rough estimate of costs incurred by Ghana Health Services for its implementation of the distributions.72

The same estimate of AMF organizational costs as we used for Malawi and DRC.

Calculated estimates of non-monetary costs incurred by Episcopal Relief & Development, ADDRO, and local governments, based on the estimate from the 2012 distribution in Ntcheu, Malawi.73

Our estimates of the cost per net for planned distributions that AMF has signed or is considering are also rough; they are based on:

The purchase price per LLIN, based on what AMF told us it expects the cost to be. AMF's estimate of the non-net costs associated with pre-distribution surveys, distribution days, and post-distribution check-ups for each upcoming distribution.74 These estimates are consistent with what we would expect based on past distributions in Malawi, DRC, and Ghana.75

An estimate of AMF's organizational costs per net in the future, including increases in AMF's salary costs in FY 2017 and FY 2018 due to planned hiring of additional staff.76 We estimate AMF's organizational costs will be about $0.08 per net in the future, compared with $0.29 in our estimates for AMF's past distributions in Malawi, DRC, and Ghana.77

We are uncertain about the use of marginal funding to AMF this year. Our best guess at the cost per LLIN in distributions AMF may fund with additional funding this year is an average of the cost per LLIN for all of AMF's past large-scale distributions and its planned distributions discussed above (weighted by AMF's spending in each country). We calculate that the weighted average is $4.85 per LLIN.78

# Global estimate of cost per LLIN

The Roll Back Malaria Partnership, which estimates funding gaps for LLINs across all African countries,99 uses an estimate of $2.70 to purchase an LLIN and $2.50 for all non-net costs of a distribution, for a total of $5.20 per LLIN.80 This assumption is used in cases where country-specific data is not available. Note that we have not seen details about where this estimate comes from, so we put little weight on it. The Co-Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Harmonization Working Group told us that non-net costs can vary significantly by country and that non-net costs in DRC may be more than $5 per LLIN.81 We have little information on how reliable the Roll Back Malaria Partnership's estimate is likely to be. Broadly, this estimate is consistent with the data we have seen from AMF. We have used estimates based on data from AMF in our cost per life saved calculations, because we have more information on their reliability. We do not believe our estimate of AMF's cost-per-net ought to be compared directly to the Roll Back Malaria Partnership's estimate, given how uncertain we are about the latter.

## Specific country funding gaps

#### Section last updated: November 2016

We spoke to individuals who are involved in national planning for mass LLIN campaigns in two countries where AMF is interested in working in the future. They provided details on why other funding sources are unlikely to be sufficient to replace LLINs when the next campaign is due. In one case, the next LLIN campaign will be due before it is likely feasible for Global Fund funding to be secured and used to order and ship LLINs. AMF may be able to move up the distribution by a year or more. There are also expected to be funding gaps for the next campaign, regardless of when it occurs, because, due to government regulations and systems, the country has been slow to spend Global Fund resources and, as a result, the Global Fund has reduced how much funding it allocates to the country. Note that the Global Fund has not yet announced its allocation to the country for the next round, so it is possible that the allocation will be higher than expected. In another case, past campaigns have had major funding gaps, and recently two major funders of previous mass campaigns, the President's Malaria Initiative and the UK Department for International Development, have shifted their focus to other malaria interventions, such as indoor residual spraying, treatment for pregnant women, strengthening health systems, and private sector case management. These two funders are not expected to provide as much funding for mass LLIN campaigns in the future as they have in the past.

# Counterfactual in countries where AMF funded distributions

Section last updated: November 2017

Ghana's National Malaria Control Program told us in August 2016 that, without AMF providing funding for the distributions in the Upper West, Greater Accra, and Northern Regions in 2016.82 No LLINs may have been available to deliver in the Upper West Region in 2016. The Upper West Region had been deprioritized relative to other regions for mass LLIN distribution, since other malaria control programs (Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention and Indoor Residual Spraying) were ongoing. Distributions in Greater Accra may have been targeted to slums and rural areas only. Note that we have seen some limited evidence that LLIN usage is generally higher in rural areas of Greater Accra than in semi-urban areas.83

LLINs originally intended for continuous distributions (e.g., LLINs distributed through antenatal clinics) may have been re-directed to mass campaigns, which may have later led to shortages in continuous distribution channels.84

Overall, our understanding from our site visit and our discussions with Ghana's National Malaria Control Program is that the counterfactual impact of AMF funding LLINs in Ghana in 2016 is complex, but that Ghana's National Malaria Program may have been appropriately triaging its malaria control needs prior to AMF's involvement, making the remaining opportunities (e.g., distributing LLINs in regions with other ongoing malaria control strategies, distributing LLINs in semi-urban areas) somewhat less impactful in expectation.

## Togo 2017

AMF and the Global Fund each funded roughly half of the costs of Togo's 2017 campaign. A representative of the health ministry in Togo told us that the Global Fund is the only major funder of net campaigns in Togo; DFID works only in certain countries and Togo is not one of them, and the U.S. government does not provide malaria funding in Togo. The World Bank has provided some funding for routine net distribution and the Chinese government has provided some funding for treatment; neither have funded net campaigns. He told us that, without AMF's funding, the campaign would have been delayed while the government sought out other funders and that he was unsure who else might have been able to provide funding.85

AMF told us that its best guess as to what would have happened without AMF funding is that Togo would have had to use the funding from the Global Fund to prioritize certain populations, such as people in highly endemic areas and/or young children and pregnant women.

The Global Fund and the Alliance for Malaria Prevention told AMF that they were not aware of other donors who might have been able to contribute a significant amount of funding to the campaign.86
