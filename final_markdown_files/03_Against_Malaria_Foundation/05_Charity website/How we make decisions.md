### How we make decisions

_When deciding to fund nets for a distribution, we look for two things: areas with a malaria problem where there is also a need for nets, and distribution partners with whom we are comfortable working._ less

There is reliable information showing where malaria is a problem. We liaise with a variety of groups, including national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) and other organisations funding nets, to establish where there is a net gap. This helps us identify areas we then investigate further. 90% of the deaths from malaria occur in sub-Saharan Africa and this region is the main focus of our activities. Malaria is also present in parts of Asia and other countries within the tropics and we do work there too. There are four operational elements to a distribution we consider important. We discuss these elements with potential distribution partners and if they share our approach to a distribution, we are keen to work with them:

1. Accurate household-level net need data  
2. Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution'  
3. Post-distribution monitoring of net use and condition  
4. Monthly malaria case rate data

1. Accurate household-level net need data

What? Number of sleeping spaces and existing usable nets. Why? So we know exactly how many nets each household needs. It is important data is recent and accurate. This helps avoid both over-delivery and under-delivery of nets to households. Over-delivery of nets is wasteful. This can occur if perfectly usable nets are not counted with households receiving four nets when they might only need two. Under-delivery of nets can leave sleeping spaces uncovered and this can compromise breaking transmission. This can occur when one net per two people is the basis for a distribution but the composition of a family might mean more nets are required. Distribution partners will typically carry out a pre-distribution registration survey (PORS) across the entire distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of LLNs with at least one year of remaining use. If there have been no, or few, nets distributed in the last three years there _may_ be no need to assess existing usable nets. If recent, accurate data based on the number of people per household exists, it may be the data used for a distribution with additional accuracy being sacrificed in order to achieve an immediate distribution and people protected. In such a case, AMF and the distribution partner discuss whether the data is reliable and up-to-date or whether a new PORS should be conducted.

2. Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution'

What? Individuals not connected with the communities receiving nets or the government health teams involved in the distribution, are present whenever a net is handed out. They check the beneficiary is identified on the net distribution list and the 'no show, no net' rule is applied. Why? This ensures nets reach those who need them and reduces to an immaterial level the misappropriation of nets.

3. Post-distribution monitoring of net use and condition

What? Data showing the level of net use and the condition of the nets. Post-distribution surveys (PDSs) are carried out at six-month intervals. Approximately 5% of the nets distributed are assessed through visits to randomly selected households. The data are published. Why? Only by gathering data do we have a strong idea of the level of net use and condition. The data can alert the distribution partner to the need for additional actions such as a net hang-up campaign or an additional malaria education intervention.

4. Monthly malaria case rate data

What? Monthly malaria data is gathered from all health centres in the distribution zone. The level of stock of rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits is monitored. Why? This allows us to assess the impact of the nets and be alerted to any trends that might suggest additional actions are necessary such as a net

These elements are addressed in an assessment process that has a number of stages:

* Is the area high risk for malaria and are we confident of the data? 
* Is there a need for nets, how many, and are we confident of the data? 
* Are there insufficient funds from other areas to meet the net need and are we confident of this information? 
* Would nets be distributed in a mass campaign (as opposed to routine distribution?) 
* Would the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) agree to the four main requirements we have of a distribution? 
* Are there potential distribution partners with the necessary resources and experience with whom we could collaborate? 
* Is there a strong leader in charge of the distribution partner(s) with whom we feel we can work closely? 
* Would the distribution partner(s) agree to the four main requirements we have of a distribution? 
* Can we agree on when the nets would be distributed? 
* Are non-net costs for the project in place? 
* Do we both feel comfortable to proceed? 

We add information showing progress with each future distribution we are assessing.
