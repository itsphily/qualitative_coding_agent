### Guiding principles

#### Efficiency, transparency and demonstrating impact are very important to us.

##### Efficiency

This influences the way we spend donations and distribute nets. 100% of your donations buys nets and we manage distributions to ensure nets get to those who need them. less

##### 100% of your donations buys nets

This is made possible by the way AMF is structured and is run, and through a broad base of pro bono support from organisations and individuals. As a result, we have very few administrative costs. Those we do have are covered by a small group of private donors. Distribution partners pay for the costs of distributing the nets (with one exception currently). This means all donations from the public buy nets.

##### Management of distributions

There are a number of ways we ensure distributions are efficient and avoid wastage and theft. A pre-distribution surey is carried out with visits to all households in a distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and perfectly usable nets already in place. This ensures a household needing three nets will receive three nets, not two or four. Detailed beneficiary lists are screened for 'ghost names' by being read out in public by community leaders. Independent supervision at the 'moment of distribution' ensures the 'no show, no net' rule is followed and helps avoid nets being misappropriated. Those not able to collect their nets on distribution day can always collect them later. This imparts a strong sense of 'fairness' (nets will not be taken by others) and 'equity' (if need three nets will get three nets) throughout a distribution.

##### Transparency

This influences the information we publish. We list every donation we receive, all information concerning a distribution and its impact, and publish significant detail about how we operate and make decisions. less

##### Donations

We list all donations received and link each to a specific distribution. Donors see exactly where the nets they fund are distributed.

##### Distributions

We publish all information and data associated with a distribution. This includes detailed malaria case rate data and post-distribution survey information.

##### Other information

We describe how we make decisions, the status of current distributions, progress with future distributions, our level of recurring donations and our governance mechanisms. Our annual accounts are easily accessible, including an 'easier-to-understand' presentation of our numbers. If there is information you cannot find, please ask us.

##### Demonstrating impact

We quantify and report on net usage and malaria levels. less

##### Net usage

If nets are used, malaria rates fall. Our distribution partners conduct post-distribution surveys every six months to assess net use and condition.

##### Malaria levels

We track monthly malaria case rate data so the impact of the nets can be quantified and reported. This involves maintaining contact with all health centres and clinics in a distribution area and ensuring reliable malaria case rate data is recorded. The data are published.
