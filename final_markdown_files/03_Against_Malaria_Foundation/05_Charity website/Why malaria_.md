#### Why malaria? _Malaria kills about 400,000 people every year and more than 200 million fall ill. Before bed nets were made available, it was three or more times that. Nets are a proven intervention - a more effective a way of saving lives than any other. There is still a long way to go and every death from malaria is preventable._

* 70% of the deaths are children under 5
* Malaria is the world's single largest killer of pregnant women
* 90% of the deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa

Yet malaria is totally preventable and treatable. **Nobody need die. ** Prevention is better than treatment. * The most effective means of prevention is sleeping under a mosquito net
* Specifically a long-lasting insecticide treated Net (LLIN)
* Each net costs $2.00/CL,70/E1.50
* Every 50-250 nets distributed and installed equals 1 life saved

#### Humanitarian issue

Given the scale of this problem, malaria is clearly a humanitarian issue. #### Economic issue

Malaria is also an economic issue. Malaria is the single greatest drag on the economy of Africa. Every $1m spent fighting malaria efficiently improves the GDP - the wealth - of the continent of Africa by $12m. Fighting malaria is a very good investment. less

As well as the approximately 400,000 people that die from malaria each year, more than 200 million fall sick with malaria. And that means a parent has to stay home with a sick child, teachers cannot teach, farmers cannot farm, drivers cannot drive, people cannot function. It fundamentally affects people working and productivity in Africa. Every $1m we spend fighting malaria efficiently we improve the GDP - the wealth - of the continent of Africa by $12m. If we want to help Africa out of the situation we all find it in beating malaria is very high up, if not top of, the list. More about malaria...

###### Abstract

In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating the number of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables
