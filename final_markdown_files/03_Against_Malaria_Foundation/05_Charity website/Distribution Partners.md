### Distribution Partners

_AMF works with the National Malaria Control Programme (IMRC) in each country and with specific distribution partners for each distribution who may take full operational responsibility for a distribution or may have specific monitoring and evaluation roles in line with the high levels of data-led accountability_

_AMF requires. We first speak with National Malaria Control Programmes and other organisations to establish net need in a country and attitude to accountability, which can then lead to more detailed discussions and identifying in-country distribution partners._
