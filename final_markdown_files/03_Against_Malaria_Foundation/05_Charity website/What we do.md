### What we do

_We help protect people from malaria._

_We fund anti-malaria nets, specifically long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIINs), and work with distribution partners to ensure they are used. We track and report on net use and malaria case data._

### Donations

People fundraise for us, typically through sponsored activities. We also receive direct donations from individuals, groups and organisations. less

100% of the funds we receive from the public buys nets. We achieve this because we have a significant level of pro bono support from organisations and individuals. Every donation is linked to a distribution so donors see where their nets go. We publish all the donations we receive.

### Monitoring

We monitor net usage to ensure nets continue to be used. We monitor malaria case rate data so we know the impact of the nets. less

Post-distribution net surveys are carried out every six months to assess net use and condition. Monthly malaria case rate data is gathered from all health centres in a distribution zone. This information helps show net impact and determine where additional community-led malaria education activities and net hang-up campaigns are appropriate. We publish all the data we collect.
