### Allocating donations

_We allocate individual donations as part of our commitment to accountability and transparency and to allow donors to follow exactly where the nets they fund are distributed. We cannot agree to fund a distribution unless we have the funds in-hand and when we agree a distribution we allocate funds to it. We allocate donations to distributions broadly in chronological order._

The fight against malaria is most effective when net distributions are planned a long time in advance. This allows a detailed understanding to be built up of how long nets will last in the climate and use typical in the region. In an ideal cycle nets would be distributed, monitored, and replacement nets funded as soon as the need becomes evident. A typical cycle will last approximately three years. However, there are regions where distributions are desperately needed on a shorter timescale, and AMF acts tactically to cover them. Where this happens we reallocate donations to meet the earlier net need.

### The mechanics of how this works

We make three types of allocation. 1. An **underwriting allocation** where net need has been identified and a commitment is needed now, but it is likely that a commitment will be made to a different, earlier distribution and this will lead to these funds being reallocated. 2. A **provisional allocation** where net need has been established and discussions are well advanced without a legally binding commitment. more
3. A **confirmed allocation**, where AMF has made a firm commitment to fund nets. Further detail follows for those who are interested. The diagram below shows an example in which distributions (shown in blue) have been agreed and funds allocated. A new distribution (shown in green) is now identified, which needs nets in a shorter period only 6 months away. Funds that have been allocated on an 'underwriting allocated' basis to one of the future distributions are reallocated to the earlier distribution, so that funds are used in chronological order. A separate diagram shows what happens to provisionally allocated donations.

### Categories of donations and the order in which they are allocated to a distribution

100% of the donations we receive from the public buys nets. *

We have always allocated (and will continue to do so) all donations individually to specific distributions so as many donors as possible can follow exactly where the nets they fund are distributed. We used to allocate donations chronologically but we now allocate first those for which the donor has a donation-tracking link as this allocates as quickly as possible donations that donors can follow. more

Donations for nets are divided into four categories on the basis of the information provided to us by donors. 1. **Identifiable** by the donor*

2. **Unlikely** to be identifiable by the donor*

3. **Not currently identifiable by the donor*

4. **Donor not identifiable***

Donations are allocated to distributions in category order - 1, 2, 3 then 4 - and chronologically within each category. more

* Note: We have a separate pool of funding that can be used for non-net costs, consisting of a small number of large donations for which the donors have specifically arranged with AMF for the donations to be used for net or non-net costs.
