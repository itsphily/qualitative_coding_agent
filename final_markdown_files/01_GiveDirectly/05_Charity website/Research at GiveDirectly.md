Research at GiveDirectly

We use rigorous experimental research (randomized controlled trials) to measure our impact and answer public policy questions.

## Experimental evaluations

Rigorous, experimental evaluation is rare among nonprofits. GiveDirectly collaborates with a wide range of leading independent researchers to measure the impacts of cash transfers and answer complex design questions through more than a dozen randomized controlled trials. We report the results of our evaluations and also announce studies in progress before the data are in, so that we can be held accountable for the results. We also run smaller, non-experimental tests to learn more about what works best and how different types of recipients spend funds they receive.

### The impact of unconditional cash transfers on poor households in rural Kenya

**Researchers:**: Johannes Haushofer (Princeton) and Jeremy Shapiro (Princeton) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action  
**Location:**: Siaya County, Kenya  
**Overview:**: The study documented large, positive impacts of cash transfers averaging ~$500 across a wide range of outcomes including assets, earnings, food security, psychological well-being, and domestic violence, an average four months after transfers ended. It also examined a number of design questions such as how to size transfers and whether to give them to men or women. A second endline survey >2 years after the end of transfers found "cash transfers result in sustained increases in assets. Long-term impacts on other dimensions, and potential spillover effects, remain to be substantiated by future work."  
**Registration:**: AEA registry entry.  
**Status:**: Peer-reviewed paper (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016); working papers published on psychological well-being for non-recipients (2019), domestic violence (2019), nutrition poverty traps

## Benchmarking a traditional nutrition and WASH program to cash

**Researchers:** Craig McIntosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action  
**Location:** Kayonza and Nyabihu districts, Rwanda  
**Overview:** The study explored the cost-effectiveness (impact per dollar) of unconditional cash transfers and of Gikuriro, an integrated nutrition program. It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study's primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey. For secondary outcomes studied, the smaller cash transfer program decreased debt and increased assets, while the nutrition program increased savings.

### Using cash transfers to benchmark the cost-effectiveness of a youth workforce readiness program

**Researchers:** Craig Mcintosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action  
**Overview:** This study benchmarked the impact of a youth employment education intervention to cash transfers in the Rwandan context. It found that both programs increased productive hours, assets, savings, and subjective well-being. Only youth training improved business knowledge, and only cash transfers improved consumption, income, and wealth. When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), "cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge". The study found little evidence that combining cash with training improved cost-effectiveness, compared to delivering cash on its own.

### How do cash transfers impact local economies?

**Researchers:** Dennis Egger (UC Berkeley), Johannes Haushofer (Princeton), Ted Miguel (UC Berkeley), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Walker (UC Berkeley), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action.  
**Location:** Siaya County, Kenya  
**Overview:** This study found that the consumption expenditure and income increased for both people who received cash, and those who did not. Over the course of 27 months, the total economic impact of a $1,000 transfer was approximately $2,600 (a fiscal multiplier of about 2.6) when impacts for recipients and non-recipients are combined. There were also gains in psychological wellbeing, food security, education and security for recipients, and no significant negative impacts were recorded for non-recipients. Delivering over 15% of local GDP in cash transfers only increased prices by 0.1% on average.

**Evaluating the impact of large cash transfers to refugees and host nationals**

**Researchers:** Dinsight (including measurement)  
**Location:** Kiryandongo, Uganda  
**Overview:** Over 1.5 million refugees and asylum-seekers live in Uganda, many of whom will remain in Uganda long-term given the protracted conflicts they are fleeing. This study will explore three core research questions: (1) What is the impact of $1,000 cash transfers on refugee households for outcomes such as income, assets, consumption, enterprise, food security and psychological well-being? (2) What do any changes caused by the cash transfers mean for the lives of refugee households and how did those changes come about? (3) What is the effect of cash transfers on host communities, and their relationship with the refugee communities?

## Non-experimental evaluations at GiveDirectly

Aside from the rigorous randomized control trials described above, we also implement a number of non-experimental projects to learn more about what's feasible, what recipients prefer, or how different types of recipients spend funds they receive differently.

## Are large cash transfers to refugees and host communities feasible?

**Location:** Kyaka II refugee settlement and surrounding communities, Uganda  
**Overview:** This evaluation comprised recipient surveys and focus group discussions to evaluate the feasibility, reported spending and indicative impact of $660 lump sum cash transfers to long term refugees and host community households. Recipients reported wide-ranging positive impacts soon after receiving and spending their transfers.

## Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?

**Location:** Lamwo District, Uganda  
**Overview:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.
