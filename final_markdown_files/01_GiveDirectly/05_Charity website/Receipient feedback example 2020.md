## 6 How is your life different than it would have been if you never received the transfer? My tailoring businesses would not have been in existence at this time. Using a leased machine is into whatever little profits I could make. With the money, I bought a sewing machine that I am proud to own. I also have enough clothes making materials that have really boosted my business.

## 7 In your opinion, what does GiveDirectly do well, and what does it not do well? In my opinion, GiveDirectly sends money right to my phone without having to use other middlemen. like the government and other organizations do. This program has been implemented within a very short time that allowed me to timely implement my ideas.

## 8 What did you spend your most recent transfer(s) on? I spent the second transfer on starting a clothes-making business. I had earlier trained myself on tailoring but had not started harvesting the fruits of my labor. I used to.lease a sewing machine from time to time and this was not making any business sense Feedback

therefore, used my transfer to buy the machine that I needed very much. I am now working independently and making more profits than before.

#### 4.1.2 Describe the biggest difference in your daily life since you started receiving payments from GiveDirectly.

#### 4.1.4 Enrolled

#### 4.1.5 What does receiving this money mean to you? Although tailoring is my profession, I do not own a sewing machine and currently I use a hired one. This requires that I pay 400 shillings every month to the owner. However, sometimes I can go for up to 4 months without paying since I do not earn enough Feedback

ambition therefore is to start a tailoring shop that will include purchasing all the necessary equipments plus fabrics for sale. This business will generate sufficient income to take care of my family. Besides I will purchase a more productive piece of land to scale up farming hence solving food insecurity in my household.

## What is the biggest hardship you've faced in your life? Financial instability as a result of unstable source of income is my biggest hardship. This problem has made provision of basic needs to be a great hustle. My husband relies on casual jobs which are hard to come by and he can spend a whole week without earning. This means I have to go an extra mile to make ends meet for my family.
