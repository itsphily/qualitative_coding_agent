"My tailoring businesses would not have been in existence at this time. Using a leased machine is into whatever little profits I could make. With the money, I bought a sewing machine that I am proud to own. I also have enough clothes making materials that have really boosted my business." View Mamake's profile

"Earnings that I started streaming in is the biggest difference in my daily life that was brought about by the transfers. I am operating a taxi business that brings in money. I have been saving ever since it kicked off. I also improved my home by building a house and bought a solar lighting system. Recharging the solar is absolutely free and this saves money that would have gone to waste buying batteries for touches to light the houses." View Kadii's profile

"My life is different now because of the house I was able to construct for my family. I wanted to do this for a long time to get a room for my children who are growing into their teenage. Due to a lack of money and poor income, I couldn't manage it. I can now afford to give them some privacy. I also own livestock that is high yielding when it comes to milk production."

"My life is better in many ways since I started a taxi business. I receive a payment of my earnings every weekend and this being a regular income, is the best thing that has ever happened. I also can start a poultry keeping initiative because of the availability of money go buy the chicken needed and to feed them. I will use the savings from my taxi business to live a better life."
