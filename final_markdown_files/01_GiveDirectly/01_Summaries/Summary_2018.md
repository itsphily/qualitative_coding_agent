## Summary

What do they do? GiveDirectly (givedirectly.org) transfers cash to households in developing countries via mobile phone-linked payment services. It targets extremely low-income households. (More)

**Does it work?** We believe that this approach faces an unusually low burden of proof, and that the available evidence supports the idea that unconditional cash transfers significantly help people. GiveDirectly has a track record of effectively delivering cash to low-income households. GiveDirectly's work has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs). (**More**)

**What do you get for your dollar?** The proportion of total expenses that GiveDirectly has delivered directly to recipients is approximately 83% overall. This estimate averages across multiple program types and relies on several rough assumptions about what costs to include and exclude. (**More**)

**Is there room for more funding?** We believe that GiveDirectly is highly likely to be constrained by funding next year. With additional funding, it could significantly increase the number of cash transfers it delivers in six countries and potentially expand to additional countries. Over 2020-2022, we estimate that GiveDirectly could productively use several hundred million dollars more than we expect it to receive. _Update: In November 2019, we recommended that Open Philanthropy grant $2.5 million to GiveDirectly, which leaves it with a funding gap of $450 million. See this page for a summary of GiveDirectly's expected use of additional funding._ (**More**)

**GiveDirectly is recommended because of its:**

Focus on a program with a low burden of proof and a strong track record. (**More**)

Strong process for ensuring that cash is well-targeted and consistently reaches its intended targets. (**More**)

Documented success in transferring a high portion of funds raised directly to recipients. (**More**)

Standout transparency (**more**).

Room for more funding. We believe that GiveDirectly can use substantial additional funding productively. (**More**)

**Major open questions include:**

There is limited evidence on the long-term impact of the type of transfers (large, one-time transfers; and, going forward, unconditional long-term income transfers) that GiveDirectly generally provides, as well as the impact of such transfers on local economies. We expect further research on these questions to be available in the future.

We have reviewed some evidence relevant to the question of the effect of cash transfers on non-recipients **here**.

Our review process

We began reviewing GiveDirectly in 2011. Our review process has consisted of extensive communications with GiveDirectly staff, reviewing documents GiveDirectly sent in response to our queries, and site visits to GiveDirectly's operations in Kenya and Uganda. We have also published a page with additional, detailed information on GiveDirectly to supplement some of the sections below.

## What do they do?

### Overview

GiveDirectly transfers cash to poor households in low-income countries primarily via mobile phone-linked payment services. It has operated since 2009 and is currently active in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Liberia, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Morocco. To date, GiveDirectly has primarily provided large, one-time transfers. It also operates a basic income guarantee program, in which recipients receive long-term (over two or twelve years in the initial study), ongoing cash transfers sufficient for basic needs (more).

GiveDirectly's work of providing cash transfers to poor households may also include:

**Experimentation**: GiveDirectly runs or participates in studies on a) the impact of cash transfers and b) the costs and benefits of various program designs, with the goal of improving its own cash transfer program, improving other cash transfer programs, or encouraging the creation of new programs. (More)

**Partnership work**: GiveDirectly pursues opportunities to partner with other organizations on cash transfer projects. Through these projects, GiveDirectly aims to encourage the evaluation of aid projects (often by using cash transfers as a standard of comparison) and ultimately influence funders to move resources from less effective aid programs to more effective ones. (More)

We discuss GiveDirectly's experimentation and partnership work to some extent below, but most of our review focuses on its direct impact, rather than the experimentation or policy impact its programs might have. We focus on direct impact because of the difficulty of predicting the impact of experimentation and partnership work without a demonstrable track record of past success.

In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly's board, including founders of the organization, started and are partial owners of a for-profit company, Segovia, which develops software that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and developing-country governments can use to help implement their cash transfer programs. GiveDirectly pays for use of Segovia's software. We discuss the potential for conflicts of interest on our page with additional information about GiveDirectly.

### Standard cash transfer program

#### Grant size

GiveDirectly's standard model involves grants of approximately $1,000 (USD) delivered over several months in two payments. We estimate that the average family receives $288 per capita from GiveDirectly. More on GiveDirectly's grant structure can be found on our page with additional information about GiveDirectly.

#### Process

GiveDirectly's typical process is as follows:

1. **Local area selection:** Select local region and then villages based largely on poverty rates.
2. **Census:** Conduct a census of all households in each village.
3. **Registration:** Send a separate team to register eligible households. This includes a) helping recipients set up a payment system to receive transfers (if they don't already have such a system in place), and b) collecting an additional round of data from the household that can be checked against the initial data from the census.
4. **Audit:** Some households are flagged for audit based on discrepancies collected in the previous steps and are revisited to collect additional data.
5. **Transfers sent:** GiveDirectly sends transfers to recipients via mobile money providers (**more**).
6. **Follow-up calls:** GiveDirectly field staff make multiple phone calls to all recipients as transfers are being sent to ask various questions about recipients' experiences. They also make in-person visits to vulnerable recipients. In addition to the follow-up calls, GiveDirectly maintains a phone "hotline" for recipients to call if they have any questions about the transfers or have issues in obtaining funds.

More detail on the above process can be found on **our page with additional information about GiveDirectly**.

We have reviewed (and made public) data collected during each step of the enrollment process for most of GiveDirectly's campaigns, with deletions to preserve anonymity.

## Staff structure

In its countries of operation, GiveDirectly's programs are overseen by a Chief Operating Officer International (COO-I), Country Directors (CDs) and Field Directors (FDs). Day-to-day operations are overseen by Field Managers and Associate Field Managers, who focus on quality control, management, training of Field Officers, logistics, and management of Field Officers. Field Officers (FOs) implement the steps required on the ground to enroll and follow up with households. They have the most face-to-face interaction with recipients and are all hired within the country of the transfers. There are separate groups of FOs for census and registration. FOs are also hired to conduct audits and follow-up surveys with recipients post-transfers; some of the FOs hired for these roles may have previously worked on the census or registration phases.

More on GiveDirectly's staff structure can be found on our page with additional information about GiveDirectly.

## Evaluation and experimentation

GiveDirectly's goals for experimentation include increasing the evidence base for cash transfers, improving recipient returns and welfare (both in GiveDirectly's program and others), and developing capabilities necessary to implement larger-scale programs or programs in new contexts. When choosing which evaluations to run, GiveDirectly also considers the potential impact on policymakers. See this spreadsheet for a full list of GiveDirectly experimentation projects. Below we discuss a few selected projects that are of greatest interest to us.

### RCT of GiveDirectly's Rarieda campaign

Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of GiveDirectly's program in which eligible households were selected randomly to receive cash transfers. These transfers were made in Rarieda, Kenya in 2011-2012. GiveDirectly publicly provided the plan for collecting and analyzing data to determine the impact of these transfers. The RCT has been published; we discuss it in detail here.

### Macroeconomic effects

Based on conversations with policymakers, GiveDirectly found that a key question relevant to government cash transfer programs is the impact they have on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and job creation. An RCT examining the macroeconomic effects of GiveDirectly's program in Kenya was completed in 2018. Details of the study are in this footnote. In October 2018, GiveDirectly shared early results from the RCT on spillover effects of its program, which we discuss here. As of April 2019, full results of the study were expected in June 2019.

### Basic income guarantee study

GiveDirectly began a study of providing long-term, ongoing cash transfers sufficient for basic needs ("basic income guarantee") in 2017. As of April 2019, the first endline data collection for this study was expected to begin in late 2019.

The study is expected to provide transfers to about 20,000 individuals; 5,000 individuals will receive a basic income for 12 years, while others will receive a basic income for 2 years or a lump sum transfer for the same amount. Basic income recipients will receive about $0.75 per adult per day (more details in footnote).

GiveDirectly has told us that policymakers, academics, and others have shown an increased interest in universal basic income experiments and GiveDirectly believes the project could have significant policy impact. We and GiveDirectly believe that the direct impact of the program (excluding any potential policy impact) is likely to be less cost-effective than GiveDirectly's standard campaign (more on our page with additional information about GiveDirectly).

### Refugee program

In December 2017, GiveDirectly launched a $3.5 million pilot program distributing cash transfers to refugees in Uganda. The program targeted refugees who had been displaced for at least five years, as well as households in the communities hosting them; in the pilot, 51% of beneficiaries were refugees. GiveDirectly believes that the households targeted by this program are at a similar level of poverty as the recipients in its standard cash transfer program; we have not seen data on the poverty levels of recipients in the refugee program. As of late March 2018, the pilot had reached 4,371 households with transfers of about $650. In September 2018, GiveDirectly published a report on the results of the pilot study. We have not reviewed the results in depth. GiveDirectly concluded that it is operationally feasible to deliver large cash transfers to refugee and host communities and that the program achieved positive outcomes.

GiveDirectly began work on a scale-up of the refugee program in Uganda, with a planned cost of $18.7 million, in September 2018, with enrollment expected to begin in June 2019. GiveDirectly aims to reach all households in the Kiryandongo settlement of Uganda with transfers of roughly $1,000. This program will continue to target long-term refugees, as well as households in the communities hosting them. GiveDirectly plans to evaluate the impact of this program through an RCT, partly with a goal of generating evidence for policymakers about the use of cash transfers in refugee programs. As of April 2019, GiveDirectly had raised over $10 million for this program and was continuing to fundraise to close the remaining gap. RCT results are expected in March 2021, and the program will conclude in early 2022.

GiveDirectly also launched a refugee program in Rwanda, with an initial planned cost of $1.97 million. Enrollment for the program began in May 2019. GiveDirectly will deliver transfers of roughly $700 to 2,276 long-term refugee households in the Mugombwa refugee camp in Rwanda, with the goal of testing this program model in a new context. As of May 2019, this project was fully funded, and the final report was expected in early 2020.

## Partnership work

GiveDirectly has partnered with a number of institutional partners and foundations to implement cash transfers to populations of specific interest to those funders.

GiveDirectly is matching funding with USAID to deliver cash transfers and run studies on its impact in Rwanda, Liberia, Malawi, and DRC. In Rwanda, GiveDirectly conducted a study to compare the impact of a nutrition program and two sizes of cash transfers, results of which were published in September 2018. As of April 2019, GiveDirectly had started distributing cash transfers in Liberia and Malawi and had established an office in DRC. In April 2019, GiveDirectly signed an agreement for an additional project with USAID in Morocco.

GiveDirectly is running additional partnership projects with other funders, generally foundations. These projects include:

In partnership with FSD Africa, GiveDirectly is piloting a cash transfer program targeting urban youth (aged 18-35) in Nairobi. Recipients will also receive access to digital financial tools aimed at encouraging entrepreneurial behavior.

In partnership with the Benckiser Stiftung Zukunft Foundation, GiveDirectly piloted a cash transfer program targeting coffee farmers in the Iganga district of Uganda. This program is complete, and results were published in May 2019.

Both the Uganda and Rwanda refugee programs (described above) are funded by a number of foundations.

We discuss the question of whether GiveDirectly has a broader impact on the international aid sector through its experimentation and partnership work below, and below we discuss the cost-effectiveness of partnership projects and how additional funding would affect its discussions with potential partners.

## Does it work?

This section discusses the following questions:

Generally speaking, are unconditional cash transfers a promising approach to helping people? We believe that this approach faces an unusually low burden of proof and that the available evidence is consistent with the idea that unconditional cash transfers help people.

**Is GiveDirectly effectively targeting very poor households?** The evidence we have suggests that GiveDirectly effectively targets low-income recipients. GiveDirectly uses two models to identify beneficiaries: in some places where it works, it distributes cash transfers to all households in selected villages, and in others it distributes cash transfers to only the households in a village that it identifies as meeting a threshold for being among the poorest. We believe that both models are likely to target very poor households.

**Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?** GiveDirectly's process seems to have been successful so far, with two notable exceptions. We find it encouraging that GiveDirectly was able to detect and respond to these cases.

**How do recipients spend their cash, and how does this spending impact their lives?** We present a variety of evidence, including findings from a randomized controlled trial of GiveDirectly's work.

**Are the size and structure of the cash transfers well-thought-through and appropriate?** We find GiveDirectly's approach to be defensible, but we look forward to seeing the results of GiveDirectly's experimentation with different approaches in the future.

**Are there negative or offsetting impacts
