Met by initial skepticism from vested interests

("Bogle's folly")

A long-term play (40 years)... ...ultimately reaching massive scale (22% of mkt)

We have created a menu of projects for funding, designed for maximum global impact

Our top current priority is fully funding the GE evaluation and putting in place long-term evaluation around it

* We have replaced IPA on this project with an RA hired by ideas42 + GD field staff, for cost reasons
* This represents our first in-house data collection, and a change in policy: whenever treatments are variations on how to do cash (rather than: does cash work at all?) we do not face a conflict of interest and can be involved in data collection
* An RA is currently in the field, defining timeline relative to the harvest season and experimental protocol
* We expect implementation to begin very soon after protocol is defined

Both retail and relational revenue streams continue to grow

We continue to track expenses closely, including changes in our cost structure as we scale

Efficiency on field spending at end Q2 FY14 - in process of being updated

\begin{tabular}{}

\end{tabular}

1 Incremental cash to be moved, i.e., new rolling field work  
2 Does not currently include US staff time on HR/general functions, or Board travel for management purposes  
3 Does not currently include US staff time on routine finance - assume we'll make the change going forward not retroactively  
4 Does not currently include back-owed local paroll liabilities for Ug-201305

Operational improvements

Implemented standardized operational reporting on a weekly and monthly basis (which we will walk through together now)

Wrote automation scripts to streamline enrollment data management and generate uniform output

Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda

Transitioned previous Ug staff members into first SFO and OM role

Selected MTN as preferred provider in Uganda after assessing performance of Ezee/MTN (building relationship with Airtel so as to have an additional hedge)

**Smarter audits:** qualitative and quantitative analysis of our audit data will identify "high-risk" recipient profiles and enable us to use a more probabilistic approach of generating audit flags (completed by end of July)

**Cost-benefit analysis:** systematic analysis of our end-to-end field model will identify ways to increase efficiency without compromising integrity/user experience (completed by end of august)

Scorecards enable us to better manage, track, and incentivize good staff performance

# Community based targeting pilots completed

Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria. Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests. Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)

Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list

Process  
Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction

All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions

In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations

Majority of households are widows, almost half have one family member that is disabled or very sick. Households seem to be as or more needy than typical GD recipients

Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations). May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs. Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict. Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.

Future outlook

With current funds, we will stop committing to new recipients in Kenya in Feb 2015, and in Uganda we stop next month

For 2015, we estimate our room for funding to be roughly $20 M with current resources and pace, $40 M at the optimal pace:

- In Kenya, we are committing ~$1M/month and can create the same structure in Ug - If we buffer two months for holidays and set-up, that's $10M/year in both countries  
- Teams are currently 5 FOs and can be increased to 10 with no other changes in structure. SFOs have previously shown the ability to manage teams of 10.  
- Teams of 10 would double our throughput to $40M/year

\begin{tabular}{c c c}  
 & Government & **Permission to operate** in new districts: low risk, as we have already obtained permission for one area, and good reputation has eased this process. \\ 
Risks & **Work permits** for expat FDs: medium risk. Carolina has one is other applications fall through, we are building local leadership, and we can turn to relationships with local recruitment firms for quick replacement if need be. \\  
 & **NGO status:** low risk, as we already have legal status in both countries. \\ 
Technology & **Dependency on a single provider**: low risk. In Uganda, we have Ezee platform: Money and Airtel as a back-up, and in Kenya could use Equity Bank. \\ 
Security: & **Terrorism or political violence in Kenya:** low risk. Thus far, this has not impacted Western Kenya. In the case of mass insecurity, could move both FDs to Uganda. \\
