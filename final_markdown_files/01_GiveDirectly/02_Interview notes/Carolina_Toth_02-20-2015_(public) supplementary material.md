Budget narrative & implications

Kenya allocation: finish existing research partnerships and move residual funds  
Uganda allocation: sufficient scale to test payment process modifications, and keep scale at or above previous year's  
Fundraising allocation: target $30M raise on $1.7M cost basis ($0.06 cost per dollar raised)  
Salary reserve allocation: required by 18-month reserve policy

2. Fundraising performance and priorities

3. Operational performance and priorities

4. Specific decisions - Rockefeller collaboration

Fundraising performance: We grew retail revenue significantly, most of it direct, and attracted several new relational funders

Fundraising performance: we improved on recurring signup but have huge room to improve on retention and reach

* Retention of older donors (pre-holiday 2013) is on par with industry for overall retention (43%)
* New donor retention will likely beat benchmark once GW holiday donors are added
* 1:1 outreach to 5K+ donors does not seem to be improving retention yet (33% vs. 31% overall)

2014 performance against other operational objectives

Objective

Deploy rolling operational model and test max speed

Regularize monthly operational reporting

Grow network of influential friends

Routinize performance-evaluation for field staff

Tighten fraud management

Improve transfer and targeting design

Deploy Segovia

Deploy for enrollment, but behind on dashboard, reporting, call center functionality.

2015 operational priorities (see appendix for deprioritized)

Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput

Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process

Confirmed
Complete Segovia deployment in Kenya and deploy in Uganda

Deliver a viable, field-tested plan for poverty targeting in any context

Receive a clean bill of health from auditor for FY2015

Appendix

Fundraising performance: Conversion fell in spite of improved site and donate form, likely because of change in traffic mix

Expansion outside of East Africa - overseeing >3 countries will overstretch current mgmt structure

Urban pilot -limited interest expressed by inst. donors, govt, private donors in urban

Challenging geography pilot - planning requirements and logistical challenges will overstretch current mgmt capacity

Office in non-Luo land - seeking advice from new board members on where to initiate conversations, but not actively pursuing until 2016 due to mgmt time required

Information-based pilots (health, education etc.) - Ideas42 info pilot already underway; limited evidence of bottom- up (i.e. recipients) or top-down (goverments, donors) interest in health/education-focused nudges

Non-HH (i.e. individual) transfers - will not deliver an obvious improvement in UX; field team focusing on generating non-housing based targeting criteria
