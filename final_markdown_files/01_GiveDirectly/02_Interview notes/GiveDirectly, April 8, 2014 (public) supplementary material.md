Agenda

1. We plan to move at least "$11M in the field in FY2014
2. We are making solid progress against our ambitious operational and research learning agenda
3. We are fully staffed, having made several key field and domestic hires
4. Our recent raise fully covers field and domestic expenses at our target level of growth
5. We are continuing to push on networking along several dimensions
6. Feedback on GiveWell review process

1. Our current plan is to move ~$11M in Kenya and Uganda in FY14

2. We are generating important operational learnings by experimenting with many aspects of the model

2. For example, upcoming work will be informed by recent experimentation on targeting

* "Saturated" 19 villages by giving to all households (excluding those in fully permanent houses)
* Compared recipient experiences of conflict/tension, preferences, and instances of gaming to 18 villages that were treated with "thatch only" criteria
* Conflict and tension were not significantly lower in saturation villages
* Gaming did not significantly decrease
* When faced with the same choice we make, the poor prioritize giving to the poorest
* We therefore plan to use thatch only criteria for upcoming enrollment
* Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
* In a separate meeting, community split into groups and categorized households according to housing materials
* Visited, verified, and registered all households categorized as eligible by saturation criteria from the groups
* Thatch is a popular criteria with communities themselves
* Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture
* Some people were still excluded, having been forgotten by their peers
* Verifying community's recommendations - especially in cases of disagreement between groups - is essential

2. In terms of research, behavioral and general equilibrium effects remain our top priorities; also now looking at gender

2. There are several other research topics we would like to investigate as we scale further

#### Examples

* Long-run household impacts
* Transfer size and lumpiness
* Returns by recipient income segment (i.e., more/less poor)
* Impacts for girls/young women (building on Nike pilot)
* Health impacts of cash transfers (e.g., targeted at women with children under 5)

6. We've observed meaningful improvements to the review process and would describe it today as very effective and efficient

A big strength of the process is how we're able to cover a lot of complex ground by email. Email dialogue is structured, specific, and convenient (esp. for field team), and phone time is used well for clean-up and digging in. We also appreciate your deferring to individuals' communication preferences for email vs. phone. We're getting into a good cadence where once you have all the info/data on an issue, we close it off and don't revisit in next cycle unless needed. This is exactly as we'd hope - as you build your institutional knowledge about us, the process gets streamlined significantly on our end. We worried about how you'd interpret data that need a lot of context, like the hotline logs which don't tell the full story and require some cultural knowledge. We were happy with the level of discussion that happened around that and ultimately felt comfortable that it'd be presented accurately. You may want to consider pushing harder on analyzing costs as much as you do on benefits. Evaluating cost data from the field can be tough since it requires a lot of on-the-ground context. Yet this could be an important value-add you provide the sector in terms of transparency and could factor into comparative assessments of interventions and orgs.
