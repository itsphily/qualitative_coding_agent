1. We have $0.2M in uncommitted funds for transfers and have room for (conservatively) and additional $10.6M in FY2014  
2. We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track costs with greater granularity  
3. We anticipate a FY2014 budget for outreach, international expansion and technology investments in the $0.5M-$1.0M range for which we are fundraising separately. 4. We are migrating online payments to Stripe with a target glove of 19 July, enabling us to capture more donor data (e.g. learned through GiveWell)  
5. Our top evaluation priorities for FY2014 include impacts of transfers on local economies and decision-making supports

## 1. We have room for an additional $10.6M of funding in FY2014

We have installed capacity to move total of 36M in FY2014. We have uncommitted capacity to move $10.6M under the management of two new Field Directors based full-time in the field * Each Field Director (FD) has capacity to move $7M/year to new recipients * Kenya FD has 10 mo of uncommitted capacity in FY14, or $5.8M * Newly recruited [New Country] FD will begin in mid-October and have capacity of $5.0M (adjusted for 2 month apprenticeship)3 * COO shifts from directly managing transfers in the field to oversight and quality control of entire operation

1. At full utilization our field operations will scale to ~70 staff

2. We are adapting our financial reporting system to track our costs with more granularity

Previous

Track four categories of transferred expenses:

1. Transfers

2. Identification costs

3. Transfer costs

4. Verification costs

Nearly all expenses were 1:1 with a specific campaign (i.e., few fixed or shared costs)

Management time (COO) was split across all field activity and allocated to campaign that was primary focus of activity during each period (typically 1 or at most 2 campaigns)

5. Our top evaluation priorities for FY2014 include impacts of transfers on local economies and decision-making supports
