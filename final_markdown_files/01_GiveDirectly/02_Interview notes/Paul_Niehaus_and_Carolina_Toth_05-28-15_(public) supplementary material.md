Kenya rolling campaign increased speed, with smaller campaigns driving learning in both Kenya and Uganda

* Began enrollment for a new campaign, 201503, in March 2015
* Roughly $2M, located in Bukedia district where all operations to date have been
* Will push learnings on cash-out models via new partnership with a bank
* Using biometrics to authenticate recipients at the cash-out point
* Stuart's last campaign before heading to business school, recruitment ongoing for a new FD to replace him
* Bukedia district still has 27,000 un-visited, eligible households, and country-wide registration is in process that will provide approval for all 7.3m households in Uganda. * Rolling campaign ongoing- paced increased to enrolling ~1,400 new HH / month at peak
* Smaller "design lab" projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow
* Operating now in Ukwala, moving Rachuonyou North in Homa Bay County in July
* County-level government approval equivalent to ~70 K additional eligible households in Siaya and Homa Bay counties

We want to better understand how you are thinking about cost-effectiveness, and how we can help

Results from ongoing studies will become available over the next 2 years, with smaller studies concluding sooner

\begin{tabular}{c c} Size & Baseline still in progress \\  & Some midline results likely available fall 2016 \\  & Final results of GE portion likely by mid 2017, with long term follow up thereafter \\  & Baseline and initial treatment complete \\  & A few bullets on baseline results available and in appendix \\  & Endline scheduled for March 2016, with paper which we can share available a few months thereafter \\  & Initial focus groups complete, second round underway \\  & Actual usage of contracts in villages pending, results available by fall 2015 \\  & Research and scoping project with The Rockefeller Foundation exploring synergy between cash programs and index insurance that included a field pilot \\  & Gave 225 past recipients a 5100 transfer and option to purchase index insurance protecting against drought with transfer, showing much lower acquisition costs than typical insurance providers get and high recipient demand ( 62%) \\  & Final read-out available summer 2015 \\ \end{tabular}

We would value your guidance on what documentation of policy impact to provide Areas of potential policy impact we could expect on

We see broader impact on the aid sector as core part of the rationale for donating to GD

We understand from previous discussions that GW tries to measure broader impact by speaking with actors whose decisions have been influenced

We would value input on which references and what documentation to provide
