We have made several changes to our field process under current $2M campaign in Kenya

* **Village saturation:** Randomized selection of 18 villages to apply saturation approach (with same size group for thatch and control)
* **Staff incentives:** Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * **Census:** Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * **Enrollment:** Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * **Back check:** Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered
