We did not deeply review studies of other kinds of cash transfer programs because we believed that if a study was not highly relevant to the core parameters driving our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly then it was unlikely to affect our decision making in 2017. We also believe that our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly is relatively robust since we estimate that a large portion of the humanitarian benefit of the intervention comes from temporarily raising recipients' consumption.

We expect to reevaluate our views on cash transfers when results from a large, new study of GiveDirectly's program are released; this study will assess the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers: see General Equilibrium Effects of Cash

### Transfers in Kenya, AEA RCT Registry.
We also edited the negative spillovers section of this report because we believe that the previous version of this section provided too many speculative caveats on the findings of potential negative effects. We plan to revisit this evidence in the future alongside the evidence from the general equilibrium study mentioned above to consider whether we should directly factor in negative effects to our cost-effectiveness analysis.

## 2018

In this May 2018 post, we explained that we were aware of recently released research which suggested that cash transfers may be less effective than we previously believed in two ways:

1. Cash may have negative spillovers on non-recipient households who live close to recipient households. 2. The benefits of cash for recipients may fade quickly over time. We conducted a more thorough literature review on the spillover effects of cash transfers and shared our updated conclusions in November 2018. We concluded that our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. For more, see the full report. We plan to address the concern about the duration of benefits at a later date because we believe it has less potential to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis for cash transfers, for reasons that are explained in this post.24
