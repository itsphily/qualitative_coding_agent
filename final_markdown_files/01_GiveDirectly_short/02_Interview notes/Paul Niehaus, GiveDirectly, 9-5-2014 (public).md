At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

### Basic income guarantee study

GiveDirectly would like to conduct a separate study on the effects of a basic income guarantee. The annual cash transfers involved would be smaller than those in GiveDirectly's standard program but granted consistently throughout the recipient's life. GiveDirectly is interested in whether people would take greater risks if they know that their basic needs are met. This study could use the same control-group villages as the GE study.

### Segovia

Segovia, a new for-profit company started by GiveDirectly board member Michael Faye, with the involvement of Dr. Niehaus and GiveDirectly board member Chris Hughes, has been incorporated, received a convertible note, and will be working on Series A financing over the next few months. The team, headed by Mr. Faye, consists of:

* A chief of staff
* A Vice President of engineering
* Two full-time engineers
* A full-time designer
* A part-time employee in a product role

Segovia's engineering team is currently working exclusively on GiveDirectly deployment. Mr. Faye and Dr. Niehaus are currently seeking Segovia's first non-GiveDirectly paying client. Segovia is not currently designed to implement programs. In the future, it may be able to offer technical assistance or implementation services. If both GiveDirectly and Segovia were offering these services, GiveDirectly would likely be more selective about the type of projects it undertakes, while Segovia would be willing to implement projects that are not designed in a way that GiveDirectly would consider optimal. Dr. Niehaus would step out of board decisions determining whether GiveDirectly should take a certain project. Segovia talks to GiveDirectly staff members Piali Mukhopadhyay, Joe Huston, and Stuart Skeates once per week, and Caroline Toth daily. Dr. Niehaus has been spending about 5-10% of his time on Segovia, which is slightly less than he had expected to spend during the past months.

### New board members

GiveDirectly recently added two new board members:

* Jacquelline Fuller, Director
* Bill Meehan, Director

It was important for GiveDirectly to find new board members who are closely aligned with GiveDirectly's vision, because decisions will likely arise for which board members who have roles at Segovia will have to step out.

### The Rarieda Randomized Control Trial (RCT)

The Rarieda RCT, which included both a $300 transfer treatment group and a $1000 transfer treatment group, did not provide strong evidence on what the best transfer size would be, because it is difficult to assess the relative value of how people use the 1000th dollar versus the 300th. There are also large confidence intervals around any of the findings based on sub-groups because of the relatively small sample size. Dr. Niehaus thinks it is unlikely $1000 is exactly the optimal size for transfers, but expects returns to be relatively flat around the $1000 mark, and so feels the costs to slight variance from the optimal transfer size are low. GiveDirectly has considered experimenting with different transfer sizes to determine the optimal amount, but feels that other research questions are more important. GiveDirectly is not concerned that recipients will run out of good ways to spend $1000 in transfer funds (e.g., purchasing an iron roof, a cow, and paying school fees for a year will use up most of a transfer). GiveDirectly also believes that while testing transfer sizes could improve its own program, it would be unlikely to affect other cash transfer programs. For example, if a government was considering providing large, one-time transfers, it would not be as concerned with whether $1000 is the right amount, but rather whether the model of large, one-time grants is effective. GiveDirectly prefers to pursue research questions that it sees as likely to influence public policy quickly (e.g., giving people control over the timing of their transfers). GiveDirectly sees the question of optimal transfer size as one that would require rigorous research to learn about, so it is not inclined to simply vary the size of its transfers as an informal experiment. It is widely accepted that periodic income transfers can reduce human suffering, but it is much less accepted that large one-time transfers can be effective ways of investing in people. There is less literature on the latter, and therefore more to be gained from researching it. Dr. Niehaus believes that some people mistakenly believe that in-kind transfers of low value can significantly change a poor person's life, when in fact it requires significant investment to lift someone out of poverty. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_
