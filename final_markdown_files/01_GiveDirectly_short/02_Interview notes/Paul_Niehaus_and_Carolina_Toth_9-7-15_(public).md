However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households.

#### Mobile money partnership

GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

#### Kenya

#### Enrollment

GiveDirectly has nearly exhausted its ability to enroll households in Siaya County, although it would be possible to treat the control group in Siaya from the General Equilibrium (GE) study. The control households make up slightly less than half the eligible households in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly wants to maintain the Siaya control group as a control for long-term follow-up purposes, and it does not anticipate problems getting further approvals from the Kenyan government for work elsewhere. GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward.

#### Rwanda

GiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison. In about two months, GiveDirectly expects to have more details about the study design and which program will be compared to cash transfers. In the future, GiveDirectly may invest its own funding in Rwanda for other cash transfer campaigns, but this depends largely on the total amount of funding it receives and on how GiveDirectly's work in Rwanda progresses.

#### Modified criteria for eligibility

The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well. GiveDirectly has found that different groups of respondents give very different answers, or that the same respondents will give very different answers on multiple tests.

### Trustee and helper system

To help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipients whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs. A helper is a position of lower responsibility. Helpers may be chosen for recipients who are very old or blind. The transfer can thus be registered in the recipient's name, but the helper retrieves the transfer or assists the recipient in using the phone.

### Security risks

#### Risk of targeting for robbery on cashout days

Large volumes of cash brought into villages on cashout days, making them a possible target for robbery. However, the banks or mobile money providers that GiveDirectly works with provide armored vehicles, security personnel, and valuable cash handling expertise for the cash out days.

#### Risk due to increased prominence

GiveDirectly does not anticipate increased risk of robbery as it becomes better known in the areas where it works. In Siaya in Kenya, GiveDirectly was extremely well known, so it seems unlikely that criminal activity in new areas where GiveDirectly is less recognized would be greater than it was in Siaya. However, likelihood of crime might vary from region to region. GiveDirectly does not consider security risk to be very high in Homa Bay County, but acknowledges that it could be more of a concern in an urban area. One of the benefits of the distributed cashout model is that it makes it easier to keep recipients' identities secret and therefore limit the potential for robbery. As part of its follow-up procedure, GiveDirectly asks recipients security-related questions, such as whether anyone knows that they are recipients and knew when they went to cash out, to monitor security risk.

_Policy on reimbursing stolen transfers_

When theft of a transfer occurs that is out of GiveDirectly's control, GiveDirectly generally does not reimburse the recipient, although it will try to help recover the money by negotiating with the thief or involving the police or local government.

### Impact of research studies on GiveDirectly's activities

#### Approach to incorporating research studies

A large number of GiveDirectly's enrollees are now participants in one of several ongoing research studies. The model for some of these studies may be significantly different from GiveDirectly's regular campaigns (i.e., the transfer amounts may be higher or lower). When a study's model deviates significantly from the way GiveDirectly publicly presents its campaigns, GiveDirectly finds an independent source of funding and does not use any retail donations to finance the study. For example, one study was funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The ideas42 study, which also represented a substantial deviation from GiveDirectly's core model, was also independently funded. Examples of retail donation-funded research projects are the GE study and the forthcoming aspirations study, which both use the model described on GiveDirectly's website. GiveDirectly is now trying to include all of its recipients in either a study or a learning objective. Learning objectives are internal tests conducted by GiveDirectly in which the standard campaign model is slightly varied. GiveDirectly uses results from learning objective campaigns to gather information about how it might adjust its operating procedures (e.g., experimentation with proxy means tests).

#### Research studies under rolling-campaign model

The rolling model is preferable in most ways to the discrete-campaign model. It allows GiveDirectly to employ people for longer than a few months at a time, and to operate more as an organization rather than a standalone project. Though it is not necessarily more difficult to incorporate a study into the rolling model, it does introduce some complexities. The rolling model places some pressure on academics to organize their studies in a way that fits into GiveDirectly's timeline. The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers. The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.

### Operational updates

#### Segovia platform

GiveDirectly expects some efficiency gains from adopting Segovia, but no more than what could be expected from any upgrade in technology, such as an upgrade in finance software. GiveDirectly's chairman, Michael Faye, is the lead on Segovia, while Dr. Niehaus leads on GiveDirectly's work, and each provides occasional support to the other. Combined, the two of them dedicate the equivalent of two CEOs' hours to Segovia and GiveDirectly.

#### US staffing

To help fill the general management position in its New York office, GiveDirectly has engaged a recruiter, which has supplied several candidates. Some of these are in late-stage conversations with GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has seen high interest in its open partnerships lead position, but identifying candidates with the right level of talent has been challenging. Recruiting for this role has been conducted mainly through networking. The candidates GiveDirectly has seen so far would likely take on more of a supporting role, assisting with analysis and strategy. GiveDirectly is also interested in a candidate who could explore more traditionally fundraising-oriented partnerships, such as corporate partnerships that could raise GiveDirectly's retail profile, as well as speak with family foundations and conduct more one-on-one discussions. Finding candidates for its open digital marketing and products position has also been a challenge, as quality talent in this field is in high demand. GiveDirectly's current management do not have many marketed-related contacts, but have started investigating personal networks more deeply. GiveDirectly has also enlisted another recruiter to help expand the pipeline of candidates.
