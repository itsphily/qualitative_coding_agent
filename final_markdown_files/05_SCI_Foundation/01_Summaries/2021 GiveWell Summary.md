## Summary

What do they do? SCI (schistosomiasiscontrollinitiative.org) works with governments in sub-Saharan Africa to create or scale up programs that treat schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) ("deworming"). SCI's role has primarily been to identify country recipients, provide funding to governments for government-implemented programs, provide advisory support, and conduct monitoring and evaluation on the process and outcomes of the programs. (More)

**Does it work? ** We believe that there is strong evidence that administration of deworming drugs reduces worm loads, but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a priority program given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. SCI has conducted studies to monitor (a non-representative sample of) about 60% of the treatments it has funded since 2014 (70% in the most recently completed cycle) to determine whether its programs have reached a large proportion of children targeted. These studies have generally found positive results, but have some methodological limitations. (More)

**What do you get for your dollar? ** Our best guess is that deworming is generally highly cost-effective. We estimate that children are dewormed for a total of around $1.03 per child in SCI-supported programs. This figure relies on several difficult-to-estimate inputs including how to account for (a) donated drugs and (b) in-kind contributions from governments with which SCI works. Excluding drugs and government contributions, we estimate that SCI's cost per treatment is $0.40. The number of lives significantly improved by deworming is also a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss in detail in a separate report. (More)

**Is there room for more funding? ** We believe that SCI could use $22.9 million more than it expects to receive to support deworming in the countries where it works in 2022-23. (More)

SCI is recommended because of its:

Focus on a program with a strong track record and excellent cost-effectiveness. (**More**)

Track record - SCI has repeatedly demonstrated success at starting and expanding national deworming programs. Standout transparency - it has shared significant, detailed information about its programs with us. **Major open questions:**

We have relatively high uncertainty about our estimate of SCI's room for more funding in 2022-23. This estimate is sensitive to our best guess of how much funding will be available from the UK government for deworming in those years. It is possible that the UK government will behave differently from how we have projected, in which case SCI's room for more funding will differ from what we have projected. The evidence we have seen on SCI's track record of reaching those it has targeted for treatment is somewhat limited. SCI has conducted studies to monitor (a non-random sample of) about 60% of the treatments it has funded since 2014, to determine whether its programs have reached a large proportion of children targeted. We are somewhat uncertain about the results we have seen because of the methodological limitations of the studies. SCI may use additional funding to, in part, treat adults in areas with moderate or high risk of schistosomiasis infection, as part of a strategy to stop transmission of the parasite. While this strategy has the potential to be cost-effective by decreasing infection rates in children over the long-term, we have not seen sufficient evidence to support it and do not currently believe it meets our criteria for evidence and cost-effectiveness.

Our review process

We began reviewing SCI in 2009. Our review has consisted of:  
Extensive communications with SCI staff, including leadership, program managers, and monitoring and evaluation and finance staff. Reviewing documents SCI sent in response to our queries. Visiting a national schistosomiasis control program meeting and demonstration mass drug administration in Malawi in October 2011 (notes and photos from this visit here). All content on SCI, including past reviews, updates, blog posts, and conversation notes, is available here. We have also published a page with additional, detailed information on SCI to supplement some of the sections below.

## What do they do?

SCI works with governments in sub-Saharan Africa to create or scale up mass drug administration programs (MDAs) for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), particularly schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) in school-aged children and other groups determined to be at high risk.1 SCI's role has primarily been to identify country recipients, provide funding to governments for government-implemented programs, provide advisory support, and conduct research on the process and outcomes of the programs.

SCI's model involves both (a) employing staff for program management, technical assistance, and capacity building and (b) funding governments to carry out infection mapping and treatment programs.

## SCI's role in mass drug administration programs

SCI's role in mass drug administrations (MDAs) in general is to:2  
Advocate for the benefits of mass drug distributions to government officials.  
Assist with planning and budgeting.  
Deliver funding and drugs to governments.  
Provide financial management and technical support.  
Develop procedures for monitoring and evaluation, analyze data, and write reports.  

In 2014, we spoke with four of SCI's program managers to better understand SCI's role in four countries. These conversations were mostly consistent with our general understanding of SCI's work. We selected Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Mozambique because SCI has spent significant unrestricted funds, the type of funding GiveWell has recommended, in these countries (more **below**). SCI selected Uganda as the fourth case study. We have summarized SCI's work in these countries on a **separate page with additional information on SCI**.

## Major funding sources for SCI's work

In SCI's April 2019-March 2020 budget year, the major sources of its funding were (a) unrestricted funds--41% of spending3--and (b) restricted funding from the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID). SCI receives this funding through Sightsavers, which receives DFID funding to treat NTDs in West and Central Africa and has named SCI as a subcontractor for this work in Cote d'Ivoire, DRC, Liberia, and Niger.4 SCI also received a number of smaller grants from other funders.5

In SCI's April 2019-March 2020 budget year, we estimate that roughly 50% of the unrestricted funding that SCI received was due to GiveWell's recommendation of SCI.6

More detail on SCI's current and past major sources of funding is available on a separate page with additional information about SCI.

## Breakdown of SCI's spending

Spending breakdown by country

April 2019 to March 2020 expenditures by country (in millions USD)? For breakdowns of SCI's spending by country in previous years, see our past reviews of SCI in this footnote.10

### Spending breakdown within country programs

In 2015, SCI began to use a system of country cashbooks, which compare monthly in-country actual spending to budgets.10 Below we have summarized the data from the country cashbooks covering April 2016 to March 2017 for Tanzania (excluding Zanzibar), Uganda, Zanzibar, Niger, Malawi, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burundi.12 We also received 2016-2017 cashbooks from Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We have excluded those countries from the overall analysis for reasons that are explained in GiveWell's analysis of SCI cashbooks 2016-2017, "Summary" tab, row 18. SCI also sent us data from its 2015-16 budget year, which is summarized here. The 2015-2016 documents included data from Niger, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda.13

Notes about the data in these cashbooks:  
Activity categories in the country cashbooks sometimes appear to be loosely defined and overlapping. For example, expenditure on drug distribution materials is sometimes classified as "drug distribution" and sometimes as "drug logistics. "14

There are some differences between expenses recorded in country cashbooks and expenses recorded in SCI budget vs. actuals 2015-16 Redacted and SCI Budget vs Actuals April 2016-March 2017 Redacted. For example, for Malawi, the total expenditure recorded for the 2015-16 budget year in both the country cashbook and SCI budget vs. actuals 2015-16 Redacted was $0.8 million, but total expenditure for Tanzania differed substantially in the two sources.15 SCI notes that the discrepancy for Tanzania is due to SCI recording the expenditure when the funds were sent to the country, while the cashbooks record when the funds are spent in-country.16 It is our understanding that SCI planned to change this system. The total amount of spending recorded in the seven country cashbooks we have included in the table below is $3.5 million, approximately one-third of the $10.9 million in total spending within country programs in SCI's 2016-17 budget year.17

### In-country SCI spending in seven countries. April 2016 - March 201718

SCI has also shared country cashbooks from its 2017-18 and 2018-19 budget years. We have not reviewed these cashbooks in depth.

## Other projects

In addition, SCI has received some smaller grants for a variety of projects, including:

_Research._ SCI has received a number of smaller grants to carry out research related to NTD control.19

_Other NTD-related activities_. SCI has also used funding from individuals for surgeries for hydrocele (a symptom of lymphatic filariasis) in Niger, and health education and water and sanitation programs in Burundi.20

## Does it work?

We believe that there is strong evidence that administration of deworming drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a priority program given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. To evaluate SCI's track record at executing programs, we have reviewed:

**Coverage surveys** from fourteen of the countries SCI has worked in, including many of the countries where SCI's work has been focused in the past five years. These household surveys estimate what percentage of individuals who were targeted for treatment actually received treatment. Overall, coverage of school-aged children was above 75% (the WHO-recommended minimum threshold) in most of the districts surveyed by SCI. We note some limitations of these surveys below.

**Prevalence and intensity studies** of infection over time from seven of the countries SCI has worked in over the past few years. Most of the surveys show improvements following SCI treatment programs. These surveys have a number of limitations and represent a small proportion of the total number of treatments delivered in SCI's programs.

**Academic papers** that might reflect the treatment coverage achieved by SCI's programs by directly measuring deworming drug uptake or by measuring worm prevalence in countries where SCI has worked.

The papers did not provide a clear case for or against programs being executed well. We discuss this analysis on a **separate page with additional information about SCI**. We have now reviewed some recent monitoring results from approximately 90% of the countries in which SCI works. For those countries from which we have seen monitoring results, we have often seen one or two years of results from the past several years. In total, SCI has conducted studies to monitor (a non-representative sample of) about 60% of the treatments it funded from 2014-17 to determine whether its programs have reached a large proportion of children targeted. We are somewhat uncertain about the results we have seen because of methodological limitations of the studies. In this section, we also discuss how the disease burden in the areas SCI works in compares to the places where the independent studies that form the evidence base for the impact of deworming were conducted. While SCI's programs generally target areas that require mass treatment according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the disease burden in SCI areas is on average lower than in the study areas, so our expectation is that the average impact per child treated is lower in SCI areas. We adjust our cost-effectiveness analysis accordingly.

### Is there independent evidence that the program is effective?

SCI supports mass school-based deworming programs, the independent evidence for which we discuss extensively in our intervention report on deworming programs. In short, we believe that there is strong evidence that administration of the drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a priority program given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. There are some important differences between the type and severity of worm infections in the places SCI works and the places where the key studies on improved life outcomes from deworming took place, which we discuss below.

### Are deworming pills delivered to and ingested by recipients?

## Coverage surveys

We have reviewed results from coverage surveys that SCI has conducted, or worked with partners to conduct, in:

Cote d'Ivoire: 2014, 2016, and 2018  
Malawi: 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017  
Uganda: 2014 and 2017  
Mozambique: 2015 and 2016  
Zanzibar: 2015 and 2018  
Zambia: 2015  
Ethiopia: 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018  
Madagascar: 2016 and 2017  
Burundi: 2017  
Liberia: 2017 and 2018  
Mauritania: 2017 and 2018  
Niger: 2017 and 2018  
Nigeria: 2017  
Tanzania: 2017 and 2018  
Democratic Republic of the Congo: 2018

We summarize the methods and results of the above surveys in this spreadsheet and discuss themes in the sections that follow. We have also received coverage surveys that SCI has conducted, or worked with partners to conduct, in Burundi (2019), Ethiopia (2019), Malawi (2018 and 2019), Uganda (2018 and 2019), and Zambia (2018). We have not reviewed these surveys in detail, and as such they are not covered in the discussion that follows.

## Methods

In each of the surveys, surveyors visit a sample of households and ask children, or in some cases their parents on their behalf, whether they received treatment in the most recent MDA. Villages and households for these surveys are generally selected randomly or quasi-randomly.22 Other survey questions, such as questions about age, gender, where the respondent received the treatment, and why the respondent did not take the drug(s), are often included as well.22 The main results are reported as "survey coverage" figures (the number of school-aged children interviewed who ingested the drug(s) divided by the total number of school-aged children interviewed), and are intended to check the accuracy of governments' "reported coverage" figures (the number of treatments delivered to school-aged children according to government administrative data divided by the estimated number of eligible school-aged children in the area).23

The methodology used in SCI's coverage surveys has differed somewhat across surveys. We have summarized the details of the methodologies used in the surveys in this spreadsheet ("Methods" sheet). "Survey coverage" and "reported coverage" estimates of the proportion of school-aged children that ingested deworming pills in SCI programs can differ substantially.24 We generally believe that coverage surveys provide more reliable information on the proportion of school-aged children that received and ingested deworming pills than "reported coverage" figures calculated by governments of countries with SCI-supported programs (justifications in footnote).25 However, we note some limitations to SCI's coverage surveys:

**Accuracy of survey responses:** We have a few concerns about the accuracy of responses from school-aged children, particularly young children (e.g., 5-6 year olds), on whether they received deworming treatments. Some coverage surveys include "verification questions" (e.g., asking children if they recognize pills), but we have not yet seen evidence from these questions that raises our general confidence in the accuracy of SCI's coverage surveys. **Length of time between MDA and survey:** This varies between less than a month and nine months in the coverage surveys we have seen from SCI. Intuitively, the more time that passes, the less likely children are to remember accurately and the more likely they are to confuse past MDAs. Ethiopia (2018) had the shortest interval, at 0-2 months, and Liberia (2018) had the longest, at 3-9 months, of the surveys for which we have seen information about the length of time between the MDA occurring and the survey occurring. Other surveys were generally carried out 2-4 months after the MDA.26

**Verification questions:** In Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi, Uganda, Zanzibar, Zambia, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mauritania, Liberia, Burundi, Niger, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania, surveyors asked some verification questions in at least one of the coverage surveys that we have seen, such as whether respondents recognized pills or dose poles presented by the interviewers, what they thought of the pills (praziquantel is very large and tastes bitter), and how many pills they took.27  
* In Mozambique (2015), respondents were asked whether they recognized the dose pole used in schistosomiasis MDAs. However, in that survey parents were surveyed on their children's behalf28 and most children (79%) received drugs at school,29 presumably when parents were not present. We do not know how to interpret the result that a very high percentage of parents (median 90%, ranging 61-94% across provinces) reported recognizing the dose pole.30 SCI hypothesized that parents may either recognize the dose pole from publicity efforts prior to the MDA or remember a similar dose pole from previous MDAs for lymphatic filariasis.31 In either case, this may indicate that the coverage survey was not measuring actual delivery of drugs to children in the 2015 MDA. The Mozambique (2016) coverage survey does not indicate that any verification questions were asked.32  
* Recognition of pills and dose poles was low in some coverage surveys. This is surprising given the high survey coverage rates in those surveys, and reduces our confidence in the accuracy of the survey coverage rates. For example, from the most recent round of coverage surveys we have seen, from 2017 and 2018, children seem to have particularly low recognition in Mauritania (2017) and Ethiopia (2017). In Mauritania (2017), recognition of praziquantel pills is approximately 10% or less in two out of three districts, and yet praziquantel survey coverage rates are greater than 80% in both districts.33 In Ethiopia (2017), recognition of both praziquantel and albendazole pills is approximately 40% or less in at least three out of four regions, and yet survey coverage rates for both treatments are greater than 75% in all regions.34

**Supervision and auditing of surveys:** Many of SCI's reports on coverage surveys mention that teams of surveyors were overseen by supervisors. It is our understanding that supervisors provide teams with guidance on the logistics of implementing coverage surveys35 but do not implement any specific data quality or auditing procedures, such as re-surveying a sample of households to check the accuracy of the data collected.36 SCI told us that its U.K.-based staff review data daily as it is entered, looking for missing or concerning data and correcting errors.37 Additionally, there are limitations that apply only to some of SCI's coverage surveys:38

### Selection of geographic target area:

All of the surveys were limited to specific geographic areas (such as districts). In Uganda (2014), Zambia (2015), Cote d'Ivoire (2014, 2015, and 2017), Ethiopia (2015), Madagascar (2016), Mauritania (2016), Nigeria (2017), Tanzania (2017 and 2018), Liberia (2017 and 2018), Zanzibar (2017), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018), and Niger (2018), these were selected randomly or nearly randomly. In Malawi (2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017), Mozambique (2015), Ethiopia (2016, 2017, and 2018), Burundi (2017a and 2017b), Niger (2017), and Uganda (2017), the districts were purposefully selected and not intended to be nationally representative. In Mauritania (2018), one district was randomly selected while the remaining two districts were purposefully selected. The selection procedures for Zanzibar (2015), Mozambique (2016), and Madagascar (2017) were not given in the documents we have seen on the surveys or were unclear.39 We believe the criteria used for the non-random sampling of districts in Ethiopia (2016 and 2017) and Malawi (2017) are particularly likely to lead to bias in the coverage results, though we are uncertain how many districts were excluded as a result of the criteria used.40 Villages and households are randomly selected within each geographic target area.41

### Independence from the government:

In Mozambique (2015 and 2016), the survey was carried out by government health staff, who may have had an incentive to bias the results. SCI told us, "[M]ost of the interviews in one district were done by the other district officers with no connection with the district."42 We believe the Ethiopia (2016, 2017, and 2018), Mauritania (2017), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018) surveys were also carried out by government health workers. Information we received on the Malawi (2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017), Uganda (2017), and Madagascar (2017) distributions note that the surveyors were independent of the government. Students or staff from universities or research institutions conducted the surveys in Uganda (2014), Zanzibar (2015 and 2018), Zambia (2015), Cote d'Ivoire (2014, 2016, and 2018), Burundi (2017a and 2017b), Niger (2017 and 2018), Mauritania (2018), and Tanzania (2018).43 It is unclear to us who conducted the Ethiopia (2015), Madagascar (2016), Nigeria (2017), Tanzania (2017), and Liberia (2017 and 2018) surveys.

### Whether parents or children were interviewed:

In Mozambique (2015 and 2016), parents were interviewed about whether their children took the drugs. In both Cote d'Ivoire and Malawi (both 2012 and 2014 surveys), if children in a household were not available, then their parents were interviewed about whether the children had received deworming drugs. SCI made different choices about whether to include these responses in the results, which slightly inflated the results overall.44 SCI told us that parents were not asked to answer on behalf of their children in Uganda (2014), Zanzibar (2015), Ethiopia (2015), and Madagascar (2016), and that going forward, SCI no longer plans to have parents answer on the behalf of children.45 We have seen no further mention of this in most of the reports for the 2017 and 2018 coverage surveys. The Ethiopia (2016 and 2018) and Tanzania (2018) coverage survey protocols indicate that caretakers could be asked whether their children received deworming drugs but only for non-school-based MDAs.46

## Results

Results from the coverage surveys we have seen are available here. For both coverage of praziquantel (to treat schistosomiasis) and coverage of albendazole (to treat STH), the median point estimate for coverage achieved by SCI, according to coverage surveys, was 85%. The fact that the surveys identified low coverage in several cases increases our confidence in their reliability. Given the smaller sample size, government involvement in the survey, and question about parents recognizing the dose pole noted above, we are more skeptical about the results from Mozambique (2015) than those from other surveys.

We have low confidence in the results from Mauritania (2017) because of government involvement, uncertainty about how districts were selected and children's low recognition of the pills. We also have low confidence in the results from Mozambique (2016) and Ethiopia (2016 and 2017) because of government involvement and uncertainty/concerns about how districts were selected. Additionally, we have limited confidence in the results of Cote d'Ivoire (2016) due to concerns about the reliability of the data.47

### Prevalence and intensity studies

SCI has conducted surveys to track changes in schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity rates following SCI-supported treatment programs. In each of these studies, SCI tracked infection rates at the same schools ("sentinel sites") each year. In general, prevalence and intensity of the parasites decreased over time in each of the countries studied. We note several methodological limitations of these surveys below. Below, we discuss results from studies of schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity from nine countries: Niger (2004-2006),48 Burundi (2007-2010 and 2007/8-2017),49 Liberia (2012-2013),50 Malawi (2012-2017), Madagascar (2015-2017), Tanzania (2016-2017), Cote d'Ivoire (2013-2016), Ethiopia (unclear when baseline took place; follow-up in 2016/2017), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018).51 We summarize the methods and results in this spreadsheet and discuss themes in the sections that follow. We have also seen impact surveys from Liberia (2018), Cote d'Ivoire (2017 and 2018), Tanzibar (2018), Zambia (2018), Madagascar (2018), Burundi (2018), and Ethiopia (2018) and reassessment reports from Malawi (2017 and 2018), Tanzania (2018), and Cote d'Ivoire (2019) We have not reviewed these surveys in detail, and as such they are not covered in the discussion that follows.

## Results from prevalence and intensity studies

The studies in Niger, Malawi (2012-17), Burundi (2007-10) and Liberia (2012-13) were originally designed as cohort studies, in which the same individuals are repeatedly surveyed over time.52 In the 2015 Malawi and 2013 Liberia studies, SCI switched to a cross-sectional sample, where random children from the same schools were surveyed, rather than the same individuals.53 The studies in Burundi (2007/8-2017), Madagascar (2015-17), Tanzania (2016-17), Cote d'Ivoire (2013-16), Ethiopia (2016/17), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018) also sample a random cross-section of children from the same schools in the baseline and follow-up surveys.54 There is no control group for these studies due to the ethical implications of withholding treatment from infected children.55 Results from the impact surveys we have seen are available here. Prevalence and intensity for the two main types of parasites that cause schistosomiasis, _S. haematobium_ and _S. mansoni_, decreased over time in each of the countries studied other than Cote d'Ivoire, in which there was a small increase in prevalence for both types of infection, and Tanzania, in which there was an increase in prevalence and intensity for _S. mansoni_.56 The prevalence and intensity of _S. mansoni_ increased between the second and third follow-up surveys in Burundi (2007/8-2017), but remained significantly lower than in the baseline.57 The prevalence and intensity of two of the three soil-transmitted helminths, hookworm and ascaris, also decreased over time in most of the countries studied.58

Though it is possible that other factors besides the treatment program caused these declines (such as improved sanitation infrastructure), the fact that the declines occurred over a short period following treatment strongly suggests that treatment caused or contributed to it. The prevalence and intensity of the third **soil-transmitted helminth**, trichuris, was generally low and the changes over time were more mixed. Prevalence and intensity decreased in approximately the same number of countries as it increased.59

In some countries, there were large differences in the change in prevalence across schools, with some schools experiencing changes in the opposite direction to the average trend for the country as a whole. In Cote d'Ivoire, despite little change in the prevalence of _S. mansoni_ or _S. haematobium_ on average, several schools experienced increases in the region of 10%.60 In Madagascar, while the prevalence of _S. haematobium_ infection and heavy-intensity infection decreased overall, there were large differences across schools.61 In Ethiopia, the prevalence of S. mansoni increased in nearly one third of schools, despite an overall reduction.62

Some of the studies also report results for other indicators of disease, such as anemia. We omit discussion of these other indicators because they are more likely to be influenced by external factors than are prevalence and intensity (see our **previous review of SCI** for discussion of these indicators and SCI Liberia impact survey dashboard 2012-13 for results from Liberia). Limitations of the prevalence and intensity study data include:

**Monitoring of selected locations in some countries.** It appears that, in the Niger and Burundi pilot studies, locations included in the study were selectively chosen rather than selected to be a representative sample of treated areas. In the Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi and Tanzania studies, schools were sampled randomly from locations at medium and high risk of infection in line with a stratified statistical approach. We are uncertain how locations in the Burundi (2007/8-2017) study were chosen.63

**Attrition of schools from the sample.** In Liberia, nearly one-third of the schools surveyed during the baseline year could not be re-visited in the follow-up year (which SCI attributes to inaccurate school identity numbers, school closures, and/or inaccurate recording of GPS coordinates), and were replaced by nearby schools.64 In Madagascar, two out of twenty-nine locations could not be revisited and were not replaced.65

**Low follow-up rates in cohort studies.** Follow-up rates were low in two of the three studies using a cohort model for follow-up (89% at the first year follow-up in Niger, 33%-50% in the pilot survey and 53%-80% in the other schools survey in Burundi (2007-2010), and 52% in the first follow-up in Malawi.66 To be included in follow-up surveys, children must be present in school when the surveys are done.67 If those who are present in school are less likely to be infected than those who are not present, this could lead to overstating the impact of the program. The connection between infection status and absenteeism could be a direct relationship (infection could cause absenteeism) or an indirect one (a third factor, such as poverty, could cause both higher levels of infection --perhaps through poor sanitation infrastructure-- and absenteeism). As previously noted, SCI has moved away from the use of cohort studies.

### Different methods of measurement for the prevalence of _S. mansoni_ lead to different prevalence rates in Burundi (2007/8-2017).

In Burundi (2007/8-2017), both the rapid urine-based Circulating Catholic Antigen (CCA) and Kato-Katz methods are used to measure the prevalence of _S. mansoni_. Prevalence using the CCA method is always higher and for one school was nearly fifty times higher. It is unclear which method is used in the reported results, or whether the same method is used in the baseline and each follow-up survey.68

### The procedure used to sample children changed between the baseline and follow-up surveys in Malawi.

In the second, third and fourth follow-up surveys in Malawi, children were sampled by age, not by grade as in the baseline. It is unclear whether the age distribution of children in these follow-ups is fully comparable to the baseline, and so whether prevalence rates are comparable.69

### Small sample size in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The survey in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was conducted on a small sample size.

# Are SCI's monitoring results representative of its work overall?

We have now reviewed monitoring results (coverage or pre- and post-treatment prevalence and intensity surveys) that cover about 60% of the treatments that SCI delivered in 2014-2017 and 70% of treatments in 2017.71 (As noted above, we have not yet reviewed all of the results that are available from 2018-19.) There is one large country program, Sudan, for which we have not seen any monitoring results.72

SCI told us that it is sometimes unable to share results because programmatic data about populations is owned by governments and therefore, in line with data sharing agreements between SCI and the countries, it is necessary to gain permission from the governments before data can be shared. It can also take some time for data, once collected, to reach SCI because in some countries it is cleaned and analyzed by country program staff before being shared with SCI.73 For example, for Mozambique, one of SCI's largest recipients of both restricted and unrestricted funds, SCI shared a report from a consultant who visited the country in May 2015 to assist with data cleaning and analysis for prevalence data from 2012, 2013, and 2014. The report notes major problems with this data and the refusal of the government to allow SCI and other international partners to have access to the data outside of Mozambique.74

Based on conversations with SCI, we understood that it planned to carry out more coverage surveys than we have received results from. Therefore, the results we have seen could overstate SCI's impact if coverage surveys are more likely to be skipped or the results withheld in countries with lower coverage rates. There are a couple of reasons this might be the case:

Country programs that have more capacity and experience are likely to be those that both carry out high-quality distributions and complete all the steps necessary for coverage surveys to be implemented and the results shared with SCI (and thus with GiveWell). Coverage surveys are more likely to be skipped or results withheld if implementers recognize that the surveys are likely to show low coverage results and reflect poorly on them. We have no evidence that this has occurred for SCI-supported programs, and note this only as a general possibility.

## What is the likely impact per treatment in SCI's programs compared with the independent studies on the impact of deworming?

In general, mass deworming programs treat everyone in a targeted demographic, regardless of whether each individual is infected (more). Because of this, the benefits (and therefore the cost-effectiveness) of a program are highly dependent on the baseline prevalence of worm infections. In this section, we discuss how the disease burden in the areas SCI works in compares to the places where the independent studies that form the evidence base for the impact of deworming were conducted. While it is our understanding that SCI's programs generally target areas that require mass treatment according to WHO guidelines, the disease burden in SCI areas is on average lower than in the study areas, so our expectation is that the impact per child treated is lower in SCI areas. We adjust our cost-effectiveness estimate (more below) accordingly. We have seen baseline data on the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and STH infections for countries that account for about three-quarters of the treatments SCI has delivered in recent years. Schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity in these countries was generally fairly low compared to the studies providing the best evidence for the benefits of deworming (Croke 2014 and Miguel and Kremer 2004). Baseline data was collected in schools that had been selected for prevalence and intensity studies. The baseline reports use methodologies that seem similar to the other SCI prevalence and intensity studies discussed above. With the exception of the study discussed above from Malawi, we have not fully vetted the methodology used in these studies. In Malawi an error in data collection may have resulted in prevalence being underestimated.75 In Zanzibar, treatment has been ongoing,76 so the study does not reflect pre-treatment conditions. Detailed results and sources are available in this spreadsheet.

## Are there any negative or offsetting impacts?

We discuss several possible considerations but do not see significant concerns.

Administering deworming drugs seems to be a relatively straightforward program.77 However, there are potential issues that could reduce the effectiveness of some treatments, such as:

Drug quality: For example, if drugs are not stored properly, they may lose effectiveness or expire. Dosage: If the incorrect dosage is given, the drugs may not have the intended effect and/or children may experience additional side effects. Replacement of government funding: We have limited information about whether governments would pay for the parts of the program paid for by SCI in its absence. We also have little information about how governments would use the resources they put toward deworming if they did not choose to implement deworming programs. Diversion of skilled labor: Drug distribution occurs only once every year or two and is conducted by volunteers in communities or teachers in schools. Given the limited time and skill demands of mass drug distribution, we are not highly concerned about distorted incentives for skilled professionals. Planning for the program can take senior government staff time. While we have limited information on what these staff would spend their time on in the absence of deworming programs, we would guess that they would support other education or health initiatives. Adverse effects and unintended consequences of taking deworming drugs: Our understanding is that expected side effects are minimal and there is little reason to be concerned about drug resistance in the near term (more information from our report on deworming). We are somewhat more concerned about potential side effects during integrated NTD MDAs, since multiple drugs are taken within a short time period. However, it is our understanding that organizations follow protocols to space out the treatments so as to avoid adverse effects. Popular discontent: We have heard a couple of accounts of discontent in response to SCI's mass drug administration campaigns, including one case that led to riots.78 SCI notes that following episodes of popular discontent, it has worked with governments to improve public education about the programs.79 Additionally, during deworming activities supported by Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative in Ogun State, Nigeria in December 2017, rumors of students collapsing reportedly generated panic that led some parents to take their children out of school; the Ogun State government denied that any students collapsed.80

What do you get for your dollar?

We estimate that on average the total cost of a schistosomiasis treatment (which is often combined with STH treatment) delivered in SCI's programs is $1.03. Excluding the cost of drugs (which are often donated) and in-kind government contributions to the programs, we estimate that SCI's cost per treatment is $0.40. We make a number of assumptions and judgments in developing our estimate. Our process could introduce errors that overstate or understate the actual cost, and there are some significant sources of uncertainty. More on our approach below. Note that our estimate of the number of lives significantly improved by SCI's programs is a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors. We discuss how the cost per treatment figure relates to how much it costs to improve a child's health and development in our report on mass treatment programs for schistosomiasis and STH. We incorporate our estimates into a cost-effectiveness model which is available here.

SCI's estimates

In October 2017, SCI estimated that it would cost _E_0.18 on average per additional treatment delivered to a school-aged child, or about $0.24 USD at the exchange rate at the time. It estimated _E_0.27 per child in the first year of a new country program.81 For community-based distributions (used when adults are also targeted for treatment), SCI also estimated _E_0.27 per person in delivery costs, but noted that it would need to purchase praziquantel for adults at a cost of _E_0.24 per treatment. Praziquantel is currently donated by a pharmaceutical company for school-aged children but not for adults.82

Our approach

Our general approach to calculating the cost per treatment is to identify comparable cost and treatment data and take the ratio. We prefer to have a broadly representative selection of treatments in order to mitigate possible distortions, such as using data from a new program, which may incur costs from advocacy, mapping, etc. before it has delivered any treatments. It is our understanding that SCI generally intends to treat for STH in all places where it treats for schistosomiasis, so the treatments SCI reports can generally be interpreted as combination schistosomiasis and STH treatments,83 though we are aware of several cases in which schistosomiasis-only treatments were delivered either by design or due to problems with implementation, and of some cases where SCI delivered STH-only treatments (SCI told us that STH-only treatments are not counted in its treatment numbers).84

To get the total cost, we attempt to include all partners (not just SCI), such that our cost per treatment represents everything required to deliver the treatments.85 In particular, we include these categories of costs:

‚Ä¢ SCI's funding to country programs (e.g., to fund drug delivery).  
‚Ä¢ SCI headquarters' costs (e.g., for management and technical salaries), including an estimate of costs paid by Imperial College (e.g., office space and some legal and administrative expenses).  
‚Ä¢ Cost of drugs. We include the full market cost of all praziquantel that is needed to deliver the treatments, regardless of whether SCI purchased it or used donated drugs. It is our understanding that DFID funds praziquantel for some countries and that in recent years SCI has not purchased drugs beyond what is funded by DFID and donated by a pharmaceutical company.  
‚Ä¢ Costs incurred by the government implementing the program (e.g., for staff salaries when working on treatment programs).

We start with this total cost figure and apply adjustments in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for cases where we believe the charity's funds have caused other actors to shift funds from a less cost-effective use to a more cost-effective use ("leverage") or from a more cost-effective use to a less cost-effective use ("funging"). (Further discussion in this blog post.) SCI notes that cost per treatment calculations should include sensitivity analysis86‚Äîi.e., analysis on the degree to which the cost per treatment varies when various assumptions vary. We have not yet completed such an analysis.

Our analysis

We analyzed several sources of data, which cover different country programs and time periods between April 2015 and March 2019, and developed several different cost per treatment estimates based on the inclusion or exclusion of different types of costs. Full details in this spreadsheet. Our estimates are:

‚Ä¢ SCI's cost per schistosomiasis treatment, including government costs and drug costs: $1.03  
‚Ä¢ SCI's cost per schistosomiasis treatment, including drug costs, but excluding government costs: $0.72  
‚Ä¢ SCI's cost per schistosomiasis treatment, including government costs, but excluding drug costs: $0.71  
‚Ä¢ SCI's cost per schistosomiasis treatment, excluding drug costs and government costs: $0.40

Shortcomings of our analysis

While we believe the estimates described above are reasonable, we want to highlight specific reasons to interpret them with caution. We rely on reported treatment data. Our understanding is that these data can often be inaccurate. We have discounted the number of treatments (by 5%) based on the differences between reported treatment rates and treatment rates found in the coverage surveys discussed above (see footnote for why this is an imperfect comparison).87

We rely on an estimate that 30% of overall program costs are attributable to the government. We derived this estimate from an analysis of a single program in Niger (this footnote elaborates on this estimate).88

We have learned about some cases where SCI reported treatments for a program where it played a limited role.89 We have adjusted for the cases we know of, but are not confident that we have learned about all such cases. We do not have data that indicate what proportion of drugs are wasted. We expect that in some cases drugs are purchased or donated but expire before use. We do not know how common this is. In our analysis, we have assumed that 10% of drugs are wasted. We do not have data on the expenses Imperial College incurs to support SCI. Based on a conversation with SCI, we have roughly estimated these expenses as 10% of SCI's expenses (excluding drugs and government contributions).90 In DRC, SCI is one of several donors contributing to an integrated neglected tropical disease (NTD) program with pooled funding.91 We are uncertain about how many deworming treatments to attribute to SCI's contribution to the program. Our understanding is that the treatment numbers SCI has reported to us in recent years represent the total number of praziquantel treatments delivered in all of DRC, which we would guess would not be appropriate to attribute to SCI's contributions alone.92 In our 2020 cost per child dewormed analysis, as a rough estimation we have assumed that SCI Foundation's cost per child dewormed in DRC is the same as Sightsavers' cost per child dewormed in DRC.93 We note that SCI has provided data on total numbers of treatments delivered in DRC (including deworming treatments and treatments for other NTDs) for 2018-19‚Äîwe have not yet reviewed this data closely, but we may do so for a future update to our cost per child dewormed per year analysis.94 Due to limited available information, we have excluded some countries SCI Foundation supported in some years from our cost per person dewormed per year analysis.95

Is there room for more funding? We believe that SCI could use more funding than it expects to receive to support its deworming programs. In short:

Available funding: As of April 2020, SCI held $27.8 million in funding, $17.8 million of which was uncommitted and available to support additional work.  
Expected funding: We project that SCI will receive an additional $13 million to support its work over the next three years.  
Spending opportunities: SCI has identified opportunities to spend up to $53.7 million, beyond the funding it has already committed, on deworming of school-aged children over the next three years. In sum, we estimate that SCI could use up to an additional $22.9 million to support deworming of school-aged children in the countries where it works during the period April 2022 through March 2024. This estimate is sensitive to our best guess of how much funding will be available from a major funder for deworming over the next three years. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet. Below, we discuss our approach to assessing SCI's room for more funding.

Our approach

In general, we assess top charities' funding needs over a three-year period.96 We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets over the next three years, along with information about their current available funding and funding pipeline. The difference between a charity's three-year budget and the funding we project that it will have available to support that budget is the charity's room for more funding.

Available funding

As of April 2020, SCI held $17.8 million in funding available to support additional work. This figure represents the $27.8 million in funding SCI had in the bank,97 less the $10 million it had already committed to deworming programs that it will support between April 2020 and March 2021. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Available and expected funding."

Expected funding

We project that SCI will receive an additional $13 million in the period April 2021 through March 2024 to support its work in those years. This projection represents our best guess based on past revenue and our understanding of SCI's funding pipeline. It excludes any funding we may specifically recommend to SCI, beyond our November 2020 recommendation to Open Philanthropy described below. We include the following sources of funding in our projection:

Funding currently held by GiveWell to be granted to SCI. We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.

_Funding recommended by GiveWell to be granted by_

_Open Philanthropy.98_ In November 2020, we recommended that Open Philanthropy grant $3.1 million to SCI to support extending the funding runway of the programs it will support in 2021 through 2022. We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year. _Projected funding due to being a GiveWell top charity._

GiveWell maintains a list of all charities that meet our criteria, along with a recommendation for which charity or charities to give to in order to maximize the impact of additional donations. Some donors give based on our top charity list, but do not follow our recommendation for marginal funding. We estimate the amount that SCI will receive from these donors in the next year and include this amount in our projection of funding available for that year only.99

_Projected funding independent of GiveWell._ We use SCI's annual revenue from the previous year, less the amount we estimate was GiveWell-directed (this includes the funding described above plus funding we specifically recommended to SCI) to estimate the funding that SCI received independent of GiveWell.100 We project that SCI will receive this amount in each of the next three years. _Projected restricted funding from the UK government's Department for International Development._ Through its ASCEND program, the UK government is funding Sightsavers to treat NTDs in West and Central Africa, and SCI is acting as a subcontractor for this work in Cote d'Ivoire, DRC, Liberia, and Niger.101 This funding is set to close at the end of March 2022 and has not been renewed beyond that point; SCI has not projected any funding from the UK government in its 2022-23 or 2023-24 program years.102 Our best guess, based on an impression that institutional funders have tended to renew grants or decrease them gradually over time, is that the UK government will continue to support deworming at some level in those years. We thus use the revenue received by SCI from the ASCEND program in the period April 2019 through March 2020 and project that SCI will receive 50% of this revenue in the 2022-23 program year and 25% in the 2023-24 program year, for a total of $3.9 million in those two program years. Our estimate of SCI's expected funding is sensitive to our best guess, described above, of how the UK government will allocate funding over the next three years. It is possible that it will behave differently from how we have projected, in which case the $13 million figure may be an over- or underestimate. More details

and calculations in **this spreadsheet**, sheet "Available and expected funding." 

## Spending opportunities

SCI has identified opportunities to spend up to $68.3 million to support deworming of school-aged children103 in the countries where it works during the period April 2021 through March 2024. SCI has categorized these opportunities as either relatively certain to materialize or as relatively less certain to materialize. We are unsure about what portion of the latter category of opportunities we should reasonably expect to materialize and have excluded them from this analysis. We have also excluded a projected spending opportunity in Kenya; because another of our top charities, Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative, **supports a national deworming program in Kenya**, we think it is unlikely that the opportunity will materialize for SCI to provide additional deworming support to the country. Our resulting best guess is that SCI will have $53.7 million in spending opportunities over the next three years. We have relatively high uncertainty about this estimate, primarily due to our uncertainty about how the UK government will allocate funding over the next three years. As mentioned above, SCI has not projected any funding in 2022-24 from the UK government for the deworming programs SCI has supported historically,104 but we have adjusted this assumption by projecting that a portion of this funding will continue. However, SCI has also not projected any funding in 2022-24 from the UK government for deworming programs that have been supported historically by other implementers,105 and has assumed that SCI will take over support of those programs in 2022-24. We have not adjusted this assumption; if the UK government behaves differently from how SCI has projected, the $53.7 million figure may be an overestimate. On the other hand, if some of the opportunities that SCI has categorized as less certain to materialize do ultimately materialize, then the $53.7 million figure may be an underestimate. After applying SCI's available and expected funding, we estimate that SCI could use up to an additional $22.9 million in funding. We estimate that SCI has sufficient funding available to support its work in its 2021-22 program year, such that additional funding now would support work between April 2022 and March 2024. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheets "RFMF projections" and "Spending opportunities." 

## Global need for treatment

There appears to be a substantial unmet need for STH and schistosomiasis treatment globally. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report on 2016 treatments stating that:106

69% of school-age children in need of treatment were treated for STH in 2016, up from 63% in 2015 and 45% in 2014. Coverage was 65% in African countries in 2016. 52% of school-age children in need of treatment were treated for schistosomiasis in 2016, up from 42% in 2015. Coverage was 58% in African countries in 2016. We have not vetted these data. 

## 5Cl as an organization

We use qualitative assessments of our top charities to inform our funding recommendations. See this page for more information about this process and for our qualitative assessment of SCI as an organization.
