### Descriptions of work in selected countries

#### Section last updated: November 2016

In 2014, we spoke with four of SCI's program managers to better understand SCI's role in four countries. These conversations were mostly consistent with our general understanding of SCI's work. We selected Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Mozambique because SCI has spent significant unrestricted funds, the type of funding GiveWell has recommended, in these countries (more **below**). SCI selected Uganda as the fourth case study. We have summarized SCI's work in these countries below. In addition, in 2015, SCI shared some details about its work in Sudan, where it recently began supporting a program, and in Nigeria, where it is considering supporting a program in the future. We have not yet written up summaries of this work (documents SCI shared are listed in footnote).1

In 2016, we did not attempt to update our understanding of SCI's role in mass drug administration (MDA) programs beyond reviewing spending data.

## Cote d'Ivoire

**History:** There was no large-scale schistosomiasis treatment program in the country prior to SCI's involvement.2 SCI began working in Cote d'Ivoire in 2010, but mapping and treatments did not begin until 2012 due to political turmoil. It has funded mapping and treatment for all qualifying districts.3 SCI expected to fund about 4.9 million treatments during its 2014-15 budget year;4 it reported delivering 3.1 million treatments in that period.5 During its 2015-16 budget year, SCI planned to deliver around 0.6 million treatments and reported delivering 1.4 million treatments.6 SCI previously told us that it spent a small amount of unrestricted funding in the country prior to 2011; we do not know what this funding was for.7

**Current plans (as of October 2016):** SCI plans to deliver 2.4 million treatments in its April 2016 to March 2017 budget year8 and 2.6 million treatments in its April 2017 to March 2018 budget year.9

**Funding:** SCI has used the U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID) funding, a grant from the company Vitol, and unrestricted funding in Cote d'Ivoire.10 In the 2014-15 budget year, SCI spent about $250,000 in restricted funding and $820,000 in unrestricted funding in the country, a significant increase over 2013-14, when SCI spent $580,000 in restricted funding and $20,000 in unrestricted funding.11 In 2015-16, SCI spent around $130,000 in unrestricted funding and around $70,000 in restricted funding in Cote d'Ivoire.12

**Impact of unrestricted funds:** SCI told us in 2014 that it believed that availability of unrestricted funds had allowed the program to scale up faster than it otherwise could have.18

**Partners:** In the early stages of the program, SCI primarily worked with the Ministry of Health and, for mapping, the Universite Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Starting in 2014, SCI began working with other partners, including Sightsavers, the END Fund, and Helen Keller International on a more integrated neglected tropical diseases (NTD) program.14

**Role of SCI staff:** SCI's Program Manager for Cote d'Ivoire described her role (as of October 2014) as providing technical expertise, helping create budgets, monitoring training and MDAs, responding to problems (for example, surveying health workers to understand low coverage of non-enrolled children, and advising on how to proceed with the program during a security threat), refining the protocol for the coverage survey, and coordinating with partners for integrated MDAs.15 From November 2013 through November 2014, she traveled to Cote d'Ivoire five times and spent almost four months there in total to assist with and monitor mapping, sentinel site and coverage survey data collection, three MDAs, and budgeting.16 She also noted the role of other SCI staff in the program: the finance team checks receipts against expense reports,17 and the biostatistician analyzes monitoring data and advises government staff on data issues.18

## Ethiopia

### History:

There was no sustained, large-scale schistosomiasis treatment program in the country prior to SCI's involvement, only a one-off, sub-national treatment.19 SCI began conversations with the government of Ethiopia about starting a national schistosomiasis treatment program in 2012. In 2013, it funded planning for the program. It funded mapping between November 2013 and April 2014, and a first round of treatment in 2013.20 In October 2016, SCI sent us a report on the 2013-14 mapping surveys (and on a second round of mapping in 2015); we have not yet reviewed this report in depth.21 In April 2015, Ethiopia treated a reported 2.9 million children for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH). SCI conducted a coverage survey following this round of treatment and collected baseline data on infection rates from 22 sentinel schools prior to the treatment round (more on these data collection methods below).22 SCI sent us a report on the baseline sentinel site surveys in October 2016; we have not yet reviewed the report in depth.23 During the remainder of SCI's 2015-16 budget year, SCI reports that an additional 5.3 million children received treatments.24

Current plans (as of October 2016): SCI plans to deliver schistosomiasis treatments to 6.5 million children (4.5 million of which will also receive STH treatments) in its 2016-17 budget year in Ethiopia,25 and plans to deliver 7.6 million schistosomiasis treatments in its April 2017 to March 2018 budget year.26

Funding: SCI spent around $2.1 million in unrestricted funding and $0.8 million in restricted funding in Ethiopia between April 2015 and March 2016.27 The END Fund and DFID have now allocated restricted funds for treatment in the country.28

Impact of unrestricted funds: SCI believes that availability of mapping data significantly improved the chances of securing funding from the END Fund and DFID, and that, at a minimum, the availability of unrestricted funds accelerated the program by a few years.29 Ethiopia's Neglected Tropical Diseases Program Manager told us that the government had not dedicated funding to schistosomiasis and that without SCI's involvement the program would likely not have gone forward. According to him, Ethiopia was not aware of any other potential partners for this work when it began working with SCI.30

Partners: SCI is funding the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to carry out treatments. It partnered with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, the technical arm of the FMOH, and the Partnership for Child Development (PCD) on mapping. PCD funded mapping in part of the country and delivered treatments in a pilot program. D eworm the World Initiative is providing technical assistance to the government.31

**Role of SCI staff:** SCI's Program Manager for Ethiopia described his role (as of October 2014) as assisting with initial program set up and funder agreements, drafting detailed plans for the next 12 months and general plans for the next 5 years, and providing technical assistance for mapping and some guidance on MDA implementation. At the time, he lived in the country32 and worked closely with the government NTD team.33

## 4 Mozambique

**History:** There was no large-scale schistosomiasis treatment program in the country prior to the involvement of SCI and Filarial Programmes Support Unit (FPSU; formerly the Centre for Neglected Tropical Diseases) (FPSU). SCI had previously funded a small-scale treatment program in Mozambique with unrestricted funding.34 SCI's grant from DFID, which started in 2010, includes funding for a sub-grant to FPSU to run schistosomiasis treatment programs in three countries, one of which is Mozambique.35 SCI and FPSU decided on this arrangement because SCI believed it would increase the chances of DFID awarding the grant.36 From April 2015 to March 2016, SCI reports delivering 4.4 million treatments, out of a targeted 5.8 million.37

**Current plans (as of October 2016):** SCI reports that it plans to deliver 8.8 million treatments in Mozambique between April 2016 and March 2017,38 and 7.3 million treatments between April 2017 and March 2018.39 SCI told us that one of the rounds of MDA originally scheduled for 2016-17 is now scheduled for 2017-18.40

**Funding:** SCI has spent both restricted funding from DFID and unrestricted funding in Mozambique. We believe the information on SCI's spending in Mozambique before the 2015-16 budget year may not be fully accurate (see footnote).41 In its 2015-16 budget year, SCI spent around $0.6 million in restricted funding and no unrestricted funds in Mozambique.42

**Impact of unrestricted funds:** SCI told us that unrestricted funds have helped the program scale, but perhaps not as much as it might appear, since SCI has shifted DFID funding to other countries with the expectation of using unrestricted funds in Mozambique.43

**Partners:** The Ministry of Health implements the program. SCI/FPSU also collaborate with RTI International, which is working on trachoma in Mozambique and has staff in-country. RTI helps to keep SCI/FPSU informed about program progress.44

**Role of SCI staff:** FPSU manages the program day-to-day. SCI has provided some assistance with monitoring and evaluation. We do not have more detail on SCI/FPSU's role in the country.45

## Uganda

**History:** SCI has worked in Uganda since 2003 and has received funding for this work from each of its large grants: Gates Foundation, USAID, and DFID. There was a gap in SCI's work between the USAID and DFID funding.46 SCI reported that it delivered 23,000 treatments in April 2014 to March 2015.47 It had planned to fund 400,000 treatments this period;48 we haven't discussed with SCI why significantly fewer treatments were delivered than planned. Between April 2015 and March 2016, SCI reports that it delivered 890,000 treatments in Uganda; 1.2 million treatments were planned.49

**Current plans (as of October 2016):** SCI plans to deliver 1.1 million treatments in Uganda between April 2016 and March 2017,50 and 2.0 million treatments between April 2017 and March 2018.51

**Funding:** In recent years, SCI has primarily used DFID funding in Uganda (about $280,000 in the fiscal year covering 2013-14, $50,000 in 2014-15, and $380,000 in 2015-16).52 In 2014, SCI allocated a small amount of unrestricted funding to Uganda to increase the number of sentinel sites for operational research purposes.53 SCI also spent about $50,000 in unrestricted funds in Uganda in 2014-15;54 we do not know what these funds were used for. SCI spent around $176,000 in unrestricted funding in Uganda in its 2015-16 budget year, substantially more than previous years.55

**Partners:** RTI International, funded by USAID, works in Uganda on an integrated mass NTD treatment program. SCI provides schistosomiasis treatment in those areas where RTI does not.56

**Role of SCI staff:** SCI told us that, due to strong in-country capacity, SCI provides only limited technical assistance for MDA. Instead, SCI's technical assistance in the country is focused on operational research on how best to move toward elimination of schistosomiasis.57 SCI's program manager for Uganda describes her role as (as of October 2014) assisting with budgets and plans, talking to the government regularly (largely through email) leading up to an MDA to make sure all the components are prepared, traveling to the country to oversee collection of prevalence and intensity data prior to an MDA, following up with the government after an MDA to get the data needed for reporting to DFID, and participating in activity reviews after each stage of the program (for example, after an MDA and after monitoring and evaluation activities).58

## Major funding sources for SCI's work

_Section last updated: November 2016_

## Large grants

SCI's work has historically been driven by a number of large grants, each with somewhat different program designs and geographic coverage.

SCI's major grants:

5/25/2021

Initial Gates Foundation grant: SCI was founded in 2002 through a $32 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.59 This grant was used to create national treatment programs for schistosomiasis and STH in six countries.60

Grants for integrated NTD control: In 2006, SCI received large grants from USAID and the Gates Foundation to support integrated NTD programs in eight countries for five years to treat lymphatic fliariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma, in addition to schistosomiasis and STH.61

It received a grant in 2007 to expand its work to Rwanda and Burundi.62 All of these grants were completed in 2011.63

DFID grants: In 2010, SCI received PS10.5 million64 (plus separate funding for drugs) from DFID for treating schistosomiasis and STH65 in eight countries over five years.66 Other NTDs are not covered by the grant, though DFID also provided funding to the FPSU to integrate treatment for lymphatic fliariasis with SCI-funded schistosomiasis and STH programs in six countries.67 In 2014, DFID awarded SCI an additional PS16.6 million over four and a half years (June 2014 to December 2018) to extend the program and expand it to an additional two countries.68

Unrestricted funding

Prior to 2011, unrestricted funds accounted for a very small portion of SCI's total funding.69 SCI told us that this funding was primarily used to fund treatments in regions of Cote d'Ivoire and Mozambique.70

In part due to GiveWell's recommendation, since November 2011, SCI has received significantly more unrestricted funds: through September 2016, GiveWell had tracked about $14.6 million in donations to SCI due to our research.71 We estimate that around 63% of the unrestricted funds that SCI raised in April 2013 to March 2016 (the period for which we have seen data) were due to GiveWell's recommendation.72

Unrestricted funds now make up a large portion of SCI's revenue. For April 2015 to March 2016, SCI reports that 48% of its revenue was unrestricted.73

Additional academic evidence

Section last updated: November 2016

To provide additional information on SCI's track record, in 2014, we conducted a search for published papers on treatment coverage rates and schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity in countries where SCI has worked. (We revisited this project in 2016 to review a recent paper from Melissa Parker and Tim Allen [Allen and Parker 2016]; we have not yet written up our conclusions. In short, our work in 2016 is largely consistent with the conclusions presented below.)

In 2014, we focused on papers by Melissa Parker and Tim Allen, who were funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to provide an anthropological perspective on SCI's work,74 papers cited in papers by Melissa Parker and Tim Allen, and other papers we identified on this topic from a Google Scholar search.75

The papers we identified were all from Tanzania, Uganda, and Zanzibar, perhaps because these are places that Melissa Parker and Tim Allen's work has focused on. This spreadsheet summarizes the papers we considered. We have not fully vetted these studies. The studies were generally designed for purposes other than to evaluate SCI's programs, so in many cases there is uncertainty about SCI's role in the areas studied. In the discussion below, we have excluded studies that we do not believe were conducted soon after treatment programs in areas targeted by SCI-funded programs. SCI staff and/or SCI funding were involved in many of the studies.76

It is difficult to draw any conclusions from these studies because of small sample sizes and lack of clarity on SCI's role in each location. In summary:77

Tanzania (excluding Zanzibar): Two studies at the district level, Stothard et al. 2013 and Chaula and Tarimo 2014, show relatively low schistosomiasis prevalence after treatment (4% and 15% respectively; the latter claims that prevalence pre-MDA was 30%). SCI was working in Tanzania at the time of both studies, but it is not clear if SCI was working in the specific areas studied. Chaula and Tarimo 2014 also shows low treatment coverage (around 40%), though the researchers asked in 2013 about treatment provided in 2011 and 2012.

Zanzibar: All studies were conducted on Unguja, "the largest and most populated island of Zanzibar."78 Two studies, Stothard et al. 2009 and Rudge et al. 2008, each in a single school, found high prevalence of schistosomiasis in areas that had received treatment (65% and 50% prevalence, respectively). However, the sample sizes were small, it is not clear why these particular schools were selected, and, while SCI was working in Zanzibar at the time of both studies, it is not clear if SCI was working in the specific areas studied. Another study, Knopp et al. 2009, in two schools in an area that had received treatment (but perhaps not from SCI) found moderate prevalence of various STHs (e.g., 22% prevalence for hookworm and low infection intensity). The schools were selected because they had been surveyed in 1994, when prevalence was found to be much higher.

Uganda: We reviewed three studies of schistosomiasis prevalence. Muhumuza et al. 2013 was conducted in part of a district that seems to have received several rounds of treatment (but perhaps not from SCI). Brooker et al. 2005 was conducted across a district that had its first MDA the year before, which was funded by SCI. Standley et al. 2009 was conducted across six districts: one district that had never been treated (but from which only one school, which had low prevalence, was included in the analysis), two districts that seem to have treated only once, and three districts that seem to have been treated for many years by SCI. Standley et al. 2009 explicitly aimed to "ambush" schools that might not have been reached by treatment programs.79 Each study found moderate to high prevalence of schistosomiasis (Muhumuza et al. 2013: 35%, Brooker et al. 2005: 26%, and Standley et al. 2009: 42%). Muhumuza et al. 2013 and Standley et al. 2009 found fairly high infection intensity (116 and 634 average eggs per gram respectively among positive cases; the WHO threshold for "high intensity" is 400 eggs per gram80). Muhumuza et al. 2013 found 28% coverage in the most recent round of treatment. The coverage survey in Muhumuza et al. 2013 seems to have been six months after treatment.
