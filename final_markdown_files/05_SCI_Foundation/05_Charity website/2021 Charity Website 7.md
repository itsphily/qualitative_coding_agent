Global NETWORK FOR

NDS  
The SCI became a founding partner of the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases which promoted the integration of control or elimination programmes against seven NTDs.

By 2007, the SCI had facilitated the delivery of approximately 40 million treatments of praziquantel against schistosomiasis, and many more deworming doses of albendazole. \(O - 2010\)

The SCI expanded its reach after the award of the management of ICOSA (Integrated Control of Schistosomiasis and Intestinal Helminths in sub-Saharan Africa) - a programme funded by the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID).

The SCI announced that it had facilitated the delivery of its 100 millionth treatment of praziquantel against schistosomiasis thanks to funding from private donations which complemented the IC OSA award from DFID.
