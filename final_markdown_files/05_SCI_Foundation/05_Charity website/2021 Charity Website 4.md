* Prior to treatment, we support in-country Ministries of Health to assess the prevalence* of infection.  
* Our biostatisticians develop risk maps, detailing predicted levels of infection across endemic areas.  
* These maps show which areas require treatment and how often to distribute treatment.  
* Schools, and children attending them, are randomly selected to provide samples to test levels of infection before and after treatment. To determine how often treatment will be needed in an area, the risk level is assessed based on prevalence of infection and according to the World Health Organization guidelines.

Examples of these surveys are:

### Who received treatment? Coverage evaluation surveys are household surveys that measure what proportion of a target population received treatment at the last MDA in a selection of areas. These allow us to assess the quality of the implementation process in terms of achieving targets, and give an indication of the quality of a country's reporting process. ### What impact has treatment had on the disease (in terms of the number of people infected and the severity of those infections)? Sentinel site surveys follow a random selection of schools across a country or treatment area over the course of a programme. These indicate the overall

. Reassessment surveys allow a broader and more robust assessment of the impact of a programme following several rounds of treatment and provide the data that MoHs need to determine future treatment strategies. In the year ending 31 March 2020, we successfully supported nine country partners in completing 18 programmatic surveys: eight each of coverage and sentinel site surveys, and two reassessment surveys.

## Social Science Research

The social scientist's main responsibility is to identify and address barriers for the uptake of treatment against parasitic worm infections. They conduct three types of activities:

of social mobilisation and sensitisation strategies adopted by local programmes. 3. Uses evidence from operational research initiatives to design and evaluate behavioural change interventions, in collaboration with partners. This all helps determine what real-time adaptations may be needed to ensure that programmes continue to have the highest impact and are a best practice in public health. SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST
