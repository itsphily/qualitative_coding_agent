## SUPPURI ARE GUSI-EFFECTIVE

We've been consistently ranked as one of the most cost-effective non-profit initiatives in the world by GiveWell, an international charity evaluator. **Just PS1 can help deliver treatment for up to 3 people**. **The Big Give Challenge**

For one week this December, your **donation will be doubled** and PS1 will support treatment for 6 people! Send me an email reminder when The Big Give campaign goes live! * Average results demonstrated for all country programmes where data are available. For every treatment provided against schistosomiasis, treatments are also offered against intestinal worm infections where both diseases are present. Treatment numbers are for schistosomiasis only and dating from 2010 when the current reporting system was established.
