Summary

# What do they do?  
Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) supports programs focused on reducing malnutrition and averting blindness and poor vision; this review focuses only on Helen Keller's work on vitamin A supplementation (VAS) in sub-Saharan Africa. Helen Keller provides technical assistance, engages in advocacy, and contributes funding to government-run vitamin A supplementation programs. (More)

## Does it work?  
There is strong evidence from many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the 1980s and 1990s that VAS can substantially reduce child mortality, but weaker evidence on how effective VAS is in the places Helen Keller would work with additional funding in the next few years. Helen Keller has conducted studies to determine whether its mass distribution programs reach a large proportion of targeted children and generally found positive results. We have also investigated the question of what effect Helen Keller's support has on programs and found a number of cases where it seems likely that Helen Keller support is necessary for supplementation to occur. (More)

## What do you get for your dollar?  
We estimate that it costs $1.10 to deliver a vitamin A supplement in Helen Keller-supported programs. The numbers of deaths averted and other benefits of VAS are a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss below. (More)

## Is there room for more funding?  
We believe that Helen Keller could use more funding than it expects to receive for VAS mass campaigns. We estimate that Helen Keller

could use up to an additional $12.7 million to support VAS mass campaigns. (More)

Helen Keller's vitamin A supplementation program is recommended because:

VAS is a program with a strong evidence base and strong cost-effectiveness. Track record - Helen Keller has experience with supporting VAS programs in a large number of countries. Standout transparency - it has shared significant, detailed information about its programs with us. Room for more funding - we believe that Helen Keller could productively use more funding than it expects to receive to scale up its VAS activities. Major open questions include:

We have not investigated Helen Keller at the same level of depth as some of our other top charities. Our general experience has been that more investigation leads us to learn about more limitations and uncertainties associated with the impact of a program and charity. We remain highly uncertain about current rates of vitamin A deficiency among preschool-aged children in areas where Helen Keller supports VAS programs. If rates of vitamin A deficiency are low, it is likely that the impact of Helen Keller's VAS programs would be limited. Will Helen Keller-supported VAS programs achieve high coverage rates? Will Helen Keller's monitoring

provide high-quality evidence of its programs' impact?

# Our investigation process

In April 2017, we invited Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) to apply to be considered for a top charity recommendation for its vitamin A supplementation program. To date, our investigation of Helen Keller has consisted of:  
Conversations with Helen Keller staff.1  
Reviewing documents Helen Keller shared with us. A visit to Conakry, Guinea in October 2017 to meet with representatives of Helen Keller.

## What do they do?  
Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) supports programs focused on reducing malnutrition and averting blindness and poor vision in countries in Africa and Asia; it also provides vision screenings and distributes eyeglasses at schools in the United States.2  
In this review, we focus only on Helen Keller's vitamin A supplementation (VAS) programs, which operate in countries in sub-Saharan Africa.3 The World Health

Organization (WHO) recommends that all preschool-aged children (aged 6 to 59 months) in areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health problem receive vitamin A supplements two to three times per year.4 Helen Keller supports countries' VAS programs for preschool-aged children by providing technical assistance, engaging in advocacy, and contributing funding to governments for implementing the programs.

## What is vitamin A supplementation?  
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that serves many purposes in the body; in particular, the immune and visual systems require it to function properly.5 Essential nutrients must be obtained through diet since the body cannot produce them on its own.6 Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) can cause stunting, anemia, xerophthalmia (dry eyes, which can lead to blindness), increased severity of infections, and death.7 WHO notes that people who have diets containing few animal products and little vitamin A-fortified food may be particularly susceptible to VAD.8 WHO estimates that VAD is most common in its Africa and South-East Asia Regions.9 Infants, children, and pregnant or lactating women with low vitamin A intake appear to have a particularly high risk of the negative health impacts caused by VAD.10

WHO notes that vitamin A from high-dose supplements can be stored in the liver and used as needed in the body for several months.11 To prevent childhood morbidity and mortality, WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation (VAS) every four to six months for all children aged 6 to 59 months in areas where VAD is a public health problem.12

More information about VAS is available in our vitamin A supplementation intervention report.

## How are vitamin A supplements distributed and administered to preschool-aged children?

### Distribution

Helen Keller-supported VAS programs distribute vitamin A supplements through either mass distribution campaigns or through routine delivery (in which caregivers take their children to facilities to receive VAS every six months).13 We have requested that Helen Keller use future GiveWell-directed funding only for mass distribution campaigns because we have a limited understanding of how to measure Helen Keller's impact on routine delivery programs. Helen Keller supports two types of VAS mass distribution campaigns:

### Door-to-door campaigns

in which community health workers travel to recipients' homes to distribute and administer vitamin A supplements and other interventions to preschool-aged children.14

### Fixed-site campaigns

in which caregivers bring preschool-aged children to health facilities or outreach posts to receive vitamin A supplements and other interventions.15 Fixed-site campaigns use social mobilization activities (e.g., fliers and radio announcements) to remind caregivers to bring their preschool-aged children to nearby distribution sites during the campaign dates.16

### This spreadsheet

lists the distribution methods of VAS mass distribution campaigns Helen Keller supported with GiveWell-directed funding in 2018 and 2019.

### Administration

Health workers implementing VAS programs are instructed to cut vitamin A capsules open with scissors and squeeze the contents of the capsules directly into children's mouths.17 Health workers are also instructed to ask caregivers about the age of the child in order to provide the correct dosage of vitamin A: 100,000 IU for 6-11 month-old infants, and 200,000 IU to 12-59 month-old children.18

# What is Helen Keller's role in VAS programs?  
Helen Keller provides the following types of support to government-run VAS programs:19

Technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation,20 training health workers and managers,21 policy design,22 planning and budgeting,23 and social mobilization24 for VAS programs (details in footnotes). Helen Keller mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates.25

Advocacy: Helen Keller encourages national governments to prioritize budgeting for and implementing VAS mass campaigns,26 and advocates for routine distribution of vitamin A supplements through health facilities.27

Funding: Helen Keller provides grants to governments to cover a portion of the implementation costs of VAS programs.28

UNICEF and Nutrition International (formerly Micronutrient Initiative) also support VAS programs in countries where Helen Keller works. Nutrition International procures the vitamin A supplements used in the programs, and UNICEF provides technical and financial support to geographic regions in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso not supported by Helen Keller.29

# Helen Keller's spending on VAS campaigns

Helen Keller's work on VAS campaigns in 2018 and 2019 was primarily funded by GiveWell-directed funding.30 Details of its spending on VAS in 2018-2019 can be found in this spreadsheet. In short, in 2019:  
Helen Keller spent a total of $5.8 million on VAS campaigns, up from $3 million in 2018. By location, Helen Keller spent between roughly $0.5 and $1.2 million each in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, and Niger. It also spent a small amount ($0.2 million) in Sierra Leone.31 It spent an additional $1.2 million on regional and central support for these country programs. By category, Helen Keller spent around 26% on grants to governments for program implementation,32 55% on direct program costs (including campaign logistics, monitoring, personnel, travel, equipment, and supplies), and 19% on overhead. We summarize Helen Keller's past spending on VAS programs during its most recent (2013-2016) grant from Global Affairs Canada in this spreadsheet.33

## Does it work?  
We base our expectation of the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns on:  
1. the evidence of effectiveness of VAS at reducing child mortality.  
2. characteristics of the areas targeted by Helen Keller's VAS campaigns (including vitamin A deficiency and child mortality), and  
3. evidence that a high proportion of targeted children receive and ingest vitamin A supplements. This expectation relies on the assumption that Helen Keller's support of VAS campaigns increases the number of children who receive VAS, compared to the number who would have in the absence of its support. To test whether this assumption holds up, we consider evidence about whether Helen Keller's support of past VAS campaigns either caused those campaigns to occur or increased the coverage rates they achieved. Finally, we consider whether there are factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that would offset the impact of Helen Keller's VAS programs, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes.

## Is there independent evidence that the program is effective?  
A large number of RCTs of VAS that were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found that VAS greatly reduces child mortality. A 1999-2004 trial with more participants than all previous studies combined (the Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A, or DEVTA, trial) did not find a statistically significant effect on mortality. We remain uncertain about what could explain this difference in results.

Further details on trials of VAS:

A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of sixteen randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial conducted in the 1980s and 1990s (Imdad et al. 2010) finds that VAS reduces mortality of 6 to 59-month-old children by 24% (95% confidence interval 17% to 31% reduction in mortality rates).34 The Deworming and Enhanced Vitamin A (DEVTA) study, a more recent trial (taking place between 1999-2004 and published in 2013) in India with around one million participants, estimates that VAS reduced child mortality by 4% and cannot rule out the possibility that VAS did not affect child mortality at all (the 95% confidence interval ranged from a 3% increase in child mortality to an 11% decrease).35 An updated version of the Cochrane review (Imdad et al. 2017) combined DEVTA and another smaller recent trial (Fisker et al. 2014) with previous trials.36 Its fixed-effect meta-analysis finds that VAS causes a 12% reduction in child mortality (95% confidence interval 7% to 17% reduction) and its random-effects meta-analysis finds that VAS causes a 24% reduction in child mortality (95% confidence interval 17% to 31% reduction).37 (See the following footnote for a description of the differences between fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses.38 Even though the overall effect found in the updated meta-analysis remains statistically significant, it is unlikely that differences between the results of DEVTA and earlier trials were due to random chance alone.39

We are uncertain about what could explain why the earlier trials and DEVTA found such different results. Some potential explanations include:

The population treated by DEVTA had lower baseline child mortality rates and may have had better overall health than many previously studied populations.40 Deaths averted by VAS in worse-off populations may have already been averted through other means (e.g., increased vaccination rates) in the DEVTA population.41 This hypothesis is undermined somewhat by the apparent lack of a correlation between how much mortality risk was reduced and baseline mortality rate in non-DEVTA trials.42

Some researchers not involved in the study have pointed to evidence suggesting that DEVTA may have failed to achieve as high a coverage rate as it reported.43

DEVTA may have had methodological weaknesses that caused it to fail to detect a statistically significant mortality effect, even if VAS had a real effect on mortality rates in the population studied (details in footnote).44

For more details, see our vitamin A supplementation intervention report. A shorter summary of our views is available in our blog post on vitamin A supplementation programs.

# Are programs targeted at areas where they are likely to be effective? We have several sources of uncertainty about how to apply evidence from the trials discussed above to the contexts in which VAS programs operate today, including: More children in today's contexts may be receiving vitamin A through food fortification programs or improved diets than children in the earlier contexts did. There appears to be limited information available on current rates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in the populations targeted by VAS. Child mortality rates in developing countries have decreased substantially over the past few decades. It is possible that deaths that may have been averted by VAS in worse-off populations in the past may already be averted through other means (e.g., increased immunization rates) in today's contexts. To estimate what effect we should expect from VAS in locations where Helen Keller supports VAS programs, we have considered the following questions: How prevalent is vitamin A deficiency in areas where Helen Keller works? How high are child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works?

How prevalent is vitamin A deficiency in areas where Helen Keller works? There is limited recent data on the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) among populations targeted by Helen Keller's VAS programs. Our best estimate, using data from a model of VAD prevalence created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease project, is that the prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children in countries where Helen Keller works or plans to work is between 25% and 36%. We estimate that the prevalence of VAD in populations represented in the meta-analysis of the effect of VAS on mortality was roughly 59%. Based on these estimates, we expect that VAS has a smaller impact on child mortality rates in populations reached by Helen Keller's programs today than the impact on mortality found in populations studied in VAS trials. We incorporate this adjustment into our cost-effectiveness analysis of Helen Keller (see below). It appears unlikely that low rates of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) explain the DEVTA results, but it is still plausible that low rates of VAD in an area may indicate that VAS programs will have a limited effect on mortality there.45 (See footnote for arguments on ways in which VAD rates may not be indicative of the impact of VAS on child mortality; we have not yet evaluated these arguments carefully. )46

The prevalence of VAD in a population can be estimated using representative surveys of serum retinol concentrations or retinol-binding protein (measured in blood samples), clinically assessed eye signs of VAD (e.g., Bitot's spots, xerophthalmia), or other measures.47 WHO defines VAD as being indicated by a serum retinol concentration lower than 0.70 mmol/L, and severe VAD as a serum retinol concentration lower than 0.35 mmol/L.48 Our estimates for the prevalence of VAD among populations studied in trials included in Imdad et al. 2017 are in this spreadsheet ("Imdad 2017 - VAD prevalence estimates" sheet). We consider our weighted average estimate of 59% prevalence of VAD in populations studied in VAS trials to be a rough best guess, based on limited data. Our process and sources for creating this estimate are outlined in the following footnote.49

We remain uncertain about the prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children in areas where Helen Keller works after considering the following sources of information:

Vitamin A deficiency surveys: We have listed the most recent serum retinol and retinol-binding protein surveys of preschool-aged children in countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs in this spreadsheet. Notes on this data:

Of the nine countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, two have completed nationally-representative surveys of VAD (using serum retinol or retinol-binding protein biomarkers) among preschool-aged children in the past ten years. The remaining countries completed VAD surveys more than ten years ago, or have not ever completed any.50

The majority of these surveys find VAD prevalence among preschool-aged children in the "severe" range as defined by WHO (above 20% prevalence).51 But one of the more recent surveys, from Kenya in 2012, found prevalence rates in the "mild" range.52 Malawi and Ghana have not received support from Helen Keller for VAS programs, but have implemented VAD surveys in the past five years—a very low prevalence of VAD among preschool-aged children was reported from a 2015-16 survey in Malawi (4%), and a relatively high rate (21%) was found in Ghana in 2017.53

VAS appears to have only a temporary impact on measures of serum retinol and retinol-binding protein concentrations.54 Accordingly, measures of serum retinol or retinol-binding protein may not be useful for evaluating the impact of a VAS program—instead, they may reflect whether or not dietary vitamin A intake is adequate.55

We have not searched for recent surveys of the prevalence of Bitot's spots or other eye signs of VAD; our understanding is that these indicators of VAD may be responsive to VAS, and so would not be useful as an indicator of "underlying" VAD in a population reached by a VAS program, but we have not investigated this issue in depth.56

Stevens et al. 2015 incorporates the most recent available VAD surveys and other relevant information (e.g., availability of animal-source foods) into a mathematical model to estimate rates of VAD as of 2013.57 We have not carefully reviewed the methodology used in this paper. Stevens et al. 2015 concludes that VAD was likely to be high (above 40%) in 2013 throughout sub-Saharan Africa.58 Three more recent vitamin A deficiency surveys from Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Kenya found considerably lower rates of VAD among preschool-aged children than the lower bound estimate for sub-Saharan African countries in Stevens et al. 2015.59

Vitamin A food fortification: Excluding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all countries in which Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs mandate that vegetable oil be fortified with vitamin A. A few others mandate or allow fortification of wheat flour or sugar with vitamin A as well. (Some countries also have programs encouraging the consumption of crops biofortified with vitamin A, but we have not investigated these programs in depth.)60 See details in this spreadsheet. We are uncertain about whether these food fortification programs have had impacts on rates of VAD among preschool-aged children in these countries. Our key findings:

In most countries in which Helen Keller has recently supported or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, we have not seen any household- or market-level surveys testing whether food samples are adequately fortified.61

A market-level survey of vegetable oil in the city of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, found that nearly all samples were adequately fortified, but other surveys we have seen found relatively low rates of adequately-fortified oil.62

Engle-Stone et al. 2017 found that rates of VAD among preschool-aged children in two cities in Cameroon did not significantly decline between 2009 and 2012, despite vitamin A fortification of vegetable oil becoming mandatory in 2011.63

### Conversations with Helen Keller and experts on vitamin A deficiency:

We have discussed our concerns about the lack of recent data on vitamin A deficiency with Helen Keller. Helen Keller told us that it believes it would be very surprising if vitamin A deficiency were no longer a problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa, especially in countries with high child mortality and malnutrition rates.64 Dr. Sherry Tanumihardjo, an expert on vitamin A status assessment, has told us that since many vitamin A oil fortification programs in countries in sub-Saharan Africa are relatively new, it would not be surprising if many of the programs were not yet functioning well enough to have an impact on VAD rates among preschool-aged children.65

In 2018, we took the information above into account to form a subjective best guess of VAD prevalence among populations targeted by Helen Keller's VAS campaigns.66 In 2019, following a conversation with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), we decided to instead use VAD prevalence estimates from its Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project.67 IHME's modeling takes past vitamin A deficiency survey results, vitamin A supplementation coverage, a socio-demographic index, and an estimate of the availability of vitamin A in a country's food supply into account (excluding fortified foods).68 IHME's estimates indicate that, as of 2017, VAD prevalence ranged from 25% to 36% among children aged 6 to 59 months in countries where Helen Keller is supporting or plans to support VAS campaigns.69 We would guess that IHME's estimates of the prevalence of VAD are more likely to be accurate than our subjective best-guesses, but our confidence in this judgment is limited for the following reasons: IHME told us that its model does not take vitamin A food fortification into account.70 We are uncertain how much we should expect vitamin A food fortification programs to affect VAD prevalence. IHME's vitamin A deficiency modeling takes vitamin A supplementation coverage into account, so a country with high coverage for vitamin A supplementation over time would be estimated to have lower vitamin A deficiency.71

To estimate the impact of VAS, we would ideally like to consider estimates of what VAD prevalence would be in absence of VAS programs.

### How high are child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works?

Child mortality rates in countries where Helen Keller works are lower than child mortality rates of some populations studied in trials of VAS in the 1980s and 1990s, but not so much lower that we would expect that Helen Keller's programs would be unlikely to be effective on average. (See above for an explanation of why VAS may have a limited impact on preventing additional child mortalities in populations where baseline rates are already relatively low.) For the nine countries where Helen Keller is supporting or plans to support VAS mass campaign programs, we estimate that mortality rates for children aged 6 to 59 months range from 4.6 to 19.0 deaths per 1,000 child-years as of 2017.72 Some major VAS trials took place in contexts where baseline mortality rates were considerably higher than these rates (see Table 1 below). Trials listed in Table 1 with baseline child mortality rates of 10.6 per 1,000 child-years or higher found that VAS significantly reduced child mortality, but the trials with lower baseline rates did not find statistically significant effects.73

Three out of the nine countries where Helen Keller supports or plans to support VAS programs have mortality rates below 10.6 per 1,000 child-years.74 For comparison, control group child mortality rates in the six main trials included in Imdad et al. 2017 are presented in the following table. 19 trials are included in the all-cause mortality meta-analysis in Imdad et al. 2017, but we focus on these six trials because they account for around 90% of Imdad et al. 2017's weighted mean estimate of the effect of VAS on mortality.75

\begin{table} 
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} 
Study & Age & Control & Mortality & Deaths/Child- \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table} 
Table 1: Characteristics of the six main studies used in the Cochrane review’s estimate of the effect of VAS on all-cause mortality

There are major limitations to our analysis so far of baseline child mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works. In particular: We have only reviewed data on national average child mortality rates. It would be more appropriate to use regional or local mortality data to evaluate the impact of Helen Keller's sub-national technical assistance work. We have not yet looked into whether reasonably high-quality data exist at the sub-national level. It seems unlikely to us that there is a real baseline mortality rate "threshold" for the effectiveness of VAS (i.e., that VAS has an impact on child mortality when baseline rates are above 10.6 per 1,000 child-years, but no effect when baseline rates are below 10.6 per 1,000 child-years). We compare baseline mortality rates in areas where Helen Keller works to 10.6 per 1,000 child-years because it may be useful as a general indication of where VAS programs are more or less effective at reducing mortality. We are uncertain whether VAS might have an impact on all mortalities caused by infectious diseases, or only a subset of specific infectious diseases. (It does not seem plausible to us that VAS could have an impact on other causes of child mortality, like accidents.) The only statistically significant cause-specific mortality reduction effect found in a meta-analysis of trials of VAS for preschool-aged children was for diarrhea.83

The same meta-analysis found a statistically significant reduction in measles incidence, but not mortality.84 See our analysis comparing mortality rates and causes of mortality between populations studied in VAS trials and targeted populations in countries where Helen Keller works in this spreadsheet. "External validity by country" sheet.

## Are vitamin A supplements delivered to and ingested by targeted children?

Helen Keller conducts coverage surveys to determine what proportion of the target population (children aged 6-59 months) was reached with VAS in the relevant campaign. We use results from past campaigns to understand the impact we should expect future campaigns to have. Specifically, we use coverage survey results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the cost of treating a child with VAS. Our interpretation of these coverage survey results is informed by their comprehensiveness and the methodology used to collect them.

### Comprehensiveness

See this spreadsheet for all results we have seen from Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. In 2018, Helen Keller began supporting VAS campaigns with GiveWell-directed funds. That year, Helen Keller supported eight such campaigns: two each in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Mali. We have seen results from all five coverage surveys that took place; surveys did not take place for three campaigns.85 In 2019, Helen Keller supported eleven VAS campaigns: one in Mali and two each in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Kenya, and Niger. We have seen results from all seven coverage surveys that took place; surveys did not take place for four campaigns.86 The surveys we have seen from 2018 and 2019 represent around 65% of Helen Keller's total spending on VAS campaigns in those years.87 While this constitutes substantial evidence for the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns, we note that it is less thorough than monitoring we have seen from some of our other top charities. Our confidence that we are seeing a representative picture of Helen Keller's work is increased by the fact that in 2018 we saw coverage surveys from all four countries where Helen Keller supported VAS campaigns, and in 2019 we saw coverage surveys from five of six countries where Helen Keller supported VAS campaigns (the exception being Kenya).88 We incorporate this assessment into our cost-effectiveness model.89

Helen Keller has also shared coverage surveys from VAS campaigns conducted prior to 2018. We have reviewed these surveys but put limited weight on their results90 because they cover a relatively small portion of Helen Keller's past work91 and many were conducted in areas where Helen Keller expected coverage to be low.92 We have focused on reviewing results from 2018 and 2019, as we believe they are more likely to be indicative of what we can expect from future VAS campaigns that Helen Keller supports using GiveWell-directed funds.

## Methodology

In Helen Keller's coverage surveys, data collectors visit a sample of households and ask household members whether the eligible children in those households received VAS during the relevant campaign. As noted above, we have focused on understanding the methodology used in the coverage surveys conducted for campaigns in 2018 and 2019 that were supported with GiveWell-directed funds. Full details of the methodology used in those surveys are in this spreadsheet.

In 2019, Helen Keller developed a revised coverage survey guide,93 with a new sampling methodology.94 As such, the remainder of this section focuses on the methodology used in the coverage surveys conducted for campaigns in 2019, along with results from those surveys. Below, we summarize Helen Keller's general 2019 coverage survey methodology and discuss methodological strengths and weaknesses. Overall, we believe that Helen Keller's coverage surveys are designed to measure key indicators of the success of VAS campaigns and to achieve samples that are generally representative of target populations. However, we are concerned that the self-reported nature of responses may produce bias in results. We are also uncertain about the quality of survey implementation because we have not seen results from the procedure used to audit data collectors' work. We incorporate our assessment of the quality of Helen Keller's coverage survey methodology into our cost-effectiveness model95 and into our qualitative assessment of Helen Keller's organizational strength.

Respondent selection: Helen Keller's 2019 coverage surveys employed two-stage cluster sampling of households in the relevant study area.96 In each survey, the study area was subdivided into smaller "enumeration areas," which were stratified as either urban or rural and in some cases by an additional quality (e.g., Helen Keller-supported or non-Helen Keller-supported).97 Enumeration areas were then selected randomly, generally with probability proportional to size, from each stratum.98 Next, data collectors performed a census of all eligible households in selected enumeration areas.99 Census data was sent to the central supervision team, which randomly selected ten eligible households (i.e., households that contained at least one child aged 6-59 months) per enumeration area. All eligible children in selected households were surveyed.100

We expect this selection protocol to result in a sample that is generally representative of the target population. We believe that bias may be introduced by data collectors during the household census, either unintentionally (if households are missed) or intentionally (if they only include households that are easier to reach).101 We believe both possibilities would bias results upward, as households missed by data collectors may also have been missed by the relevant campaign. We note that we have not seen evidence that this occurred and note it only as a possibility. If a selected household is unavailable, data collectors are instructed to return up to two additional times to attempt to interview that household.102 The coverage survey reports for the first 2019 campaign in Burkina Faso and the second 2019 campaign in Cote d'Ivoire state that replacement households were provided to data collectors;103 we do not know how often replacement households were used in those cases. Our understanding is that replacement households were not provided in other surveys.104

In the surveys we have reviewed, 99% or higher of the targeted number of households were interviewed.105 This low sample attrition (i.e., households randomly selected to be interviewed not being interviewed) is unsurprising, as household interviews were conducted shortly after the household census.

### Survey design

Helen Keller has developed standard questionnaires,106 which in 2019 were adapted for use in each country and translated into local languages. Each of the 2019 coverage surveys we have reviewed included a pilot survey, during which questionnaires were tested and updated prior to survey implementation.107 The adaptation, translation, and piloting of questionnaires in each setting increases our confidence that they are administered appropriately and consistently across contexts. A potential source of bias in Helen Keller's coverage surveys is their heavy reliance on self-reported responses. The questionnaire used during household interviews instructs data collectors to ask household members questions about VAS and other interventions, such as deworming, received by each eligible child in the household during the relevant campaign.108 We believe that these responses are at risk of recall bias, as respondents must answer questions about multiple interventions and possibly multiple children. This concern is mitigated by the fact that in most cases, the recall period for these responses was relatively short, about one month.109 Self-reported responses are also at risk of social desirability bias that could lead respondents to overreport VAS administration, if they believe that this is the preferred response of data collectors. We would have more confidence in a survey that tested the reliability of self-reported responses against some objective measure. The questionnaire instructs data collectors to show household members vitamin A capsules and deworming tablets (or photos of these items) when asking questions about these treatments, but while these visual aids may improve accurate recall, they are not used to verify responses (for example, by asking respondents to identify these items before they are asked if eligible children received them).

### Survey implementation:

Helen Keller contracts with independent consultants that recruit data collectors and supervisors and oversee survey implementation. Generally, data collectors and supervisors were not involved in VAS campaign implementation, which suggests that they are unlikely to have a personal interest in survey outcomes. Helen Keller's 2019 coverage surveys included an auditing procedure in which supervisors randomly selected and then re-surveyed 10% of households in order to assess the accuracy of initial results, to which they were blinded. We see the inclusion of such a procedure as a methodological strength, both because it may encourage accurate data collection and because it provides a check on the accuracy of results. However, we have not seen data on the level of correspondence found between initial and re-survey results. We are thus uncertain about the quality of survey implementation.

### Data capture:

Data was collected electronically.14 One concern we have about coverage surveys in general is that data may be lost after being collected. However, we believe it is unlikely that substantial data loss occurred after collection in Helen Keller's 2019 coverage surveys. This is because, as mentioned above, in the surveys we have reviewed, data was collected and uploaded from 99% or higher of the number of households that were targeted to be interviewed.15

## Results

We believe that results from Helen Keller's coverage surveys provide relatively strong evidence that a high proportion of the target population has been reached with VAS in past campaigns. We use results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the **cost of treating a child with VAS**. See **this spreadsheet** for all results we have seen from Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. In short, in 2019:

The median coverage rate from surveys of campaigns that were supported by Helen Keller using GiveWell-directed funds was 85%.16

The lowest coverage rate measured by these surveys was 74%, from the first VAS campaign of the year in two regions of Mali supported by Helen Keller.17 The highest coverage rate was 94%, from the first VAS campaign of the year in six regions of Niger supported by Helen Keller.18

75% of these surveys measured coverage rates above 80%,19 which is the coverage rate targeted by Helen Keller for its VAS campaigns.120

## How does Helen Keller's support affect program outcomes? 

The evidence we have discussed to this point forms the basis of our expectation of the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns. This expectation relies on the assumption that Helen Keller's support of VAS campaigns increases the number of children who receive VAS, compared to the number who would have in the absence of its support. To test whether this assumption holds up, we have considered evidence about whether Helen Keller's support of past VAS campaigns either caused those campaigns to occur or increased the coverage rates they achieved. We have found strong evidence in some cases that Helen Keller's financial support enables VAS mass campaigns to occur. Helen Keller's support may impact the outcome of VAS mass campaigns in the following ways:

**Increasing coverage rates:** Helen Keller identifies districts or regions participating in mass campaigns that have low VAS coverage rates and provides sub-national governments in those regions with technical support.121

Causing VAS campaigns to occur: In the absence of external technical assistance and funding, Helen Keller told us that VAS campaigns and programs would not occur at all in some countries.122

We have completed case studies on the types of impact Helen Keller's involvement may have on VAS mass campaigns for a selection of Helen Keller's past country programs. Helen Keller selected the countries for these case studies based on the availability of in-country staff for phone interviews; we are uncertain how representative our five country case studies are of the thirteen countries in which Helen Keller has recently supported VAS programs. In our case studies, we found strong evidence in a few cases that Helen Keller's financial support enables mass distributions of VAS to occur. We have not yet seen evidence we find convincing that Helen Keller's technical assistance enables mass distribution programs to achieve higher coverage rates than the programs would achieve in Helen Keller's absence, primarily because we lack information about coverage rates in areas without Helen Keller-supported programs (details in footnote).123

The full details of our case studies are available in this spreadsheet.

## Are there any negative or offsetting impacts?

In this section, we consider factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that could offset the impact of Helen Keller's VAS campaigns, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes.

### Potential VAS interaction with vaccines and increased mortality in some groups: Benn et al. 2009

Reanalyzed data from an earlier VAS trial in Ghana to test the hypothesis that VAS reduced mortality in children whose most recent vaccine was a live vaccine (e.g., measles), but could lead to increased mortality in children (particularly girls) whose most recent vaccine was an inactivated vaccine (e.g., DTP).124 The data re-analysis found that VAS was associated with nonsignificant increases in mortality among girls who had received vaccinations.125 The authors of Fisker et al. 2014, a 2007-2010 trial in Guinea-Bissau of VAS, intended for the trial to test for interactions between VAS, live or inactivated vaccines, and gender.126 The trial found no significant effect on mortality overall, a nonsignificant increase in mortality for boys, and no evidence of a differential effect based on receiving live or inactivated vaccines.127 Based on the results of Fisker et al. 2014, it does not appear that increased mortality following VAS and live or inactivated vaccinations for boys or girls is a substantial concern. We have also completed research on the biological plausibility of interactions between VAS, vaccines, and sex, and did not find reasons to believe that harmful impacts are highly plausible (details in footnote).128

### Adverse side effects of vitamin A supplements:

Some preschool-aged children experience side effects after taking vitamin A supplements, including loose stools, headache, irritability, fever, nausea, and vomiting.129 WHO cites an estimate of the prevalence of these types of side effects of 1.5% to 7%; we have not vetted this estimate.130

**Potential vitamin A overdose:** Chronic excessive vitamin A intake can cause a serious condition called vitamin A toxicity (also known as hypervitaminosis A).131 Our understanding is that cases of vitamin A toxicity are very rare globally, and that VAS programs are not thought to be a cause of cases of vitamin A toxicity.132

**Diversion of skilled labor:** VAS mass campaigns involve Ministry of Health staff, nurses, and other health workers.133 We are uncertain of the degree to which participating in VAS programs reduces their ability to complete other duties, but we note that our understanding is that VAS campaigns usually take between a few days and a few weeks to complete.134

## What do you get for your dollar?

# Cost per vitamin A supplement delivered

We estimate that on average the total cost to deliver a vitamin A supplement through Helen Keller-supported mass distribution programs is $1.10.

## Our approach

For programs that distribute health commodities, our general approach for calculating a "cost per item delivered" estimate is to identify comparable data on costs and items delivered and take the ratio. We try to include all costs incurred to carry out a project, not just those that the charity in question pays for itself. We start with this total cost figure and apply adjustments in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for cases in which we believe the charity's funds have caused other actors to shift funds from a less cost-effective use to a more cost-effective use ("leverage") or from a more cost-effective use to a less cost-effective use ("funging"). We prefer to calculate average "cost per item delivered" estimates using data from a broadly representative sample of mass distribution rounds, since costs may vary considerably in different contexts. We have used the following inputs to construct our cost per supplement estimate for Helen Keller:

Helen Keller's actual expenditures for VAS distribution rounds in 2018 and 2019 in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.135

Rough estimates of expected spending by other organizations supporting VAS distribution rounds in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in 2018 and 2019, including UNICEF, Nutrition International, the World Health Organization (WHO), World Vision, and Save the Children.136

An assumption about the amount that the governments of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger will contribute to VAS programs in the form of in-kind contributions.137

An estimate of the number of children who received vitamin A supplements, based on estimates from Helen Keller of the number of children in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger aged 6-59 months and the results of Helen Keller's coverage surveys we have seen from GiveWell-supported campaigns.138

## Our cost per supplement estimate

Using the approach described in the section above, we estimate that it costs $1.10 on average to deliver a vitamin A supplement in Helen Keller-supported VAS mass distribution programs. Full details are in this spreadsheet.

Shortcomings of our cost per supplement analysis

The following are key limitations of our cost per supplement analysis:

We have limited information on the contributions of organizations other than Helen Keller supporting VAS mass campaigns in Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger in 2018 and 2019 (UNICEF, Save the Children, Nutrition International, WHO, World Vision, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria).39 We have only seen information on how much funding these organizations have budgeted for government grants to support program implementation, but our cost per supplement estimate also relies on rough estimates of how much additional funding these organizations will use for other expenses, including personnel and overhead costs.140

We rely on an estimate that 30% of overall program costs are indirect government costs (e.g., time-use of salaried government officials), the same estimate we use for the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative's deworming programs. We would guess that VAS programs and deworming programs require similar types of contributions from governments, but we note that the 30% estimate is derived from a single deworming program in Niger.141

Our cost per supplement estimate also relies on Helen Keller's estimates of the population of 6-to-59-month-old children in Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.142 We are uncertain about the accuracy of these population estimates. We only have cost per supplement estimates for Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, but Helen Keller also currently supports VAS campaigns in Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya.143 We do not include cost per supplement estimates for Cote d'Ivoire and Kenya in our analysis because we have seen limited information from Helen Keller's programs in those countries to date (details in footnote).144

### Cost-effectiveness

See our most recent cost-effectiveness model for estimates of the cost per life saved through Helen Keller's VAS programs. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. Helen Keller-supported VAS campaigns also deliver additional interventions alongside VAS, including deworming, polio vaccination, "mop-up" immunizations (for children who have missed scheduled immunizations), and screening for severe acute malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition.145 A major limitation of our cost-effectiveness analysis of Helen Keller is that we do not directly include benefits resulting from interventions delivered alongside VAS in Helen Keller-supported programs.146

## Is there room for more funding?

We believe that Helen Keller could use more funding than it expects to receive to expand its support of VAS mass campaigns in Cameroon, Kenya, and additional states in Nigeria. In short:

**Available funding:** As of June 30, 2020, Helen Keller held $23.3 million in funding for VAS mass campaigns. It had committed all but $2.0 million of this funding to support VAS mass campaigns in 2020-2023. **Expected funding:** We project that Helen Keller will receive an additional $11.8 million to support its work over the next three years. **Spending opportunities:** Helen Keller has identified opportunities to spend up to $24.4 million, beyond the commitments it has already made, over the next three years. In sum, we estimate that Helen Keller could use up to an additional $12.7 million to support VAS mass campaigns. We have substantial uncertainties about these funding gaps (details below). More details and calculations are available in this spreadsheet. Below, we discuss our approach to assessing Helen Keller's room for more funding.

## Our approach

In general, we assess top charities' funding needs over a three-year period.147 We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets over the next three years, along with information about their current available funding and funding pipeline. The difference between a charity's three-year budget and the funding we project that it will have available to support that budget is the charity's room for more funding. For this analysis, we focus only on Helen Keller's programs supporting VAS mass campaigns.

### Available funding

As of June 30, 2020, Helen Keller held $2.0 million in funding available to support additional future work. This figure represents the $23.3 million in funding Helen Keller had in the bank,148 less the $21.3 million in funding it had already committed to future activities. Helen Keller's funding commitments include providing support to VAS mass campaigns in upcoming years in

# Expected funding

We project that Helen Keller will receive an additional $11.8 million to support its work over the next three years. This projection represents our best guess based on past revenue and our understanding of Helen Keller's funding pipeline. It excludes any funding we may specifically recommend to Helen Keller, beyond our November 2020 recommendation to Open Philanthropy described below. We include the following sources of funding in our projection:

Funding currently held by GiveWell to be granted to Helen Keller. We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.149

Funding recommended by GiveWell to be granted by Open Philanthropy.150 In November 2020, we recommended that Open Philanthropy grant $8.1 million to Helen Keller to support extending its current programs through 2023 and expanding to Benue state, Nigeria.151 We include this amount in

our projection of funding available for the next year.152

Projected funding due to being a GiveWell top charity. GiveWell maintains a list of all charities that meet our criteria, along with a recommendation for which charity or charities to give to in order to maximize the impact of additional donations. Some donors give based on our top charity list, but do not follow our recommendation for marginal funding. We estimate the amount that Helen Keller will receive from these donors in the next year and include this amount in our projection of funding available for that year only.153

We assume for our projection that two foundations that have previously supported Helen Keller's VAS mass campaigns will renew their support in 2022 and 2023--we are uncertain about whether these foundations will in fact make additional grants to Helen Keller.154

More details and calculations are available in the "Available and expected funding" and "Additional calculations" sheets of this spreadsheet.

### Past sources of funds for VAS programs

Between 2006 and 2016, Helen Keller's VAS programs were primarily funded by Global Affairs Canada.155

Most recently, Global Affairs Canada granted $29 million CAD to Helen Keller to support VAS programs in 13 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 2013 and 2016.156 Helen Keller submitted a concept note to Global Affairs Canada for the continuation of these programs between 2016 and 2021, but Helen Keller did not receive a new grant.157 Global Affairs Canada has also made grants to UNICEF and Nutrition International to support VAS programs in sub-Saharan Africa.158 Helen Keller told us that, going forward, Global Affairs Canada planned to grant funds only to UNICEF for VAS programs in order to ease administrative burdens.159

## Spending opportunities

Helen Keller has identified opportunities to spend up to $24.4 million, beyond the commitments it has already made. After applying Helen Keller's expected funding, we estimate that Helen Keller could use up to an additional $12.7 million in funding over the next three years to expand its support of VAS programs in Cameroon, Kenya, and four states in Nigeria. For these funding gaps, we note open questions about what would happen in the absence of Helen Keller's support:

**Cameroon ($3.8 million):** Helen Keller has proposed supporting regions of Cameroon that have recently received support for VAS mass campaigns from UNICEF.160 It is our understanding that it is not yet clear whether UNICEF will be able to continue to support VAS campaigns in these regions of Cameroon going forward--UNICEF's ability to support these regions depends in part on the amount of funding it receives from Global Affairs Canada following 2020, which is not yet finalized.161

**Nigeria ($5.4 million):** In 2020, Helen Keller began supporting VAS mass campaigns in Nasarawa, Nigeria, and it has proposed expanding its support to five additional states over the next three years;162 our November 2020 recommendation to Open Philanthropy (see above) provided funding for expansion to the first of these states, Benue. It is our understanding that some states in Nigeria implement VAS campaigns and there is little high-quality information available on the coverage rates that have been achieved in recent years. Helen Keller proposed supporting VAS campaigns in Bauchi State, Nigeria, in 2019, and we asked Helen Keller to implement a baseline coverage survey prior to beginning its work. The coverage survey found a coverage rate of 86%, and Helen Keller learned that another organization, Catholic Relief Services, was already supporting VAS campaigns in the state.163 We have not seen baseline coverage surveys from Nasarawa or Helen Keller's proposed expansion states in Nigeria, so we are uncertain about what VAS coverage levels to expect in the absence of Helen Keller's support. Helen Keller has shared a qualitative assessment of VAS distribution

in health facilities in Nasarawa State in November 2019.164

**Kenya ($3.5 million):** Helen Keller has proposed expanding, between 2021 and 2023, its support of VAS campaigns to additional geographic areas of Kenya that have been supported by UNICEF in recent years. We are uncertain about the extent to which UNICEF may be able to continue to support these areas in upcoming years.165 Our question about UNICEF's plans is informed, in part, by discussions we had with Helen Keller about a funding gap for VAS in Kenya in 2020. Helen Keller told us in June 2020 that it expected to need an additional $1 million per year for VAS in Kenya starting in the second half of 2020.166 According to Helen Keller, the need emerged due to a reallocation of UNICEF's support from vitamin A to COVID-19 response.167 We later learned that it was likely that UNICEF would in fact allocate funding to the VAS program in the second half of 2020 rather than letting it lapse.168 However, according to Helen Keller, at the current level of UNICEF support, there may be opportunities to increase VAS coverage rates in UNICEF-supported areas through additional financial and technical support.169

More details and calculations are available in the "RFMF projections" and "Spending opportunities" sheets of this spreadsheet.

Global room for more funding for VAS programs

Global Affairs Canada granted 70 million CAD to Helen Keller and UNICEF for VAS programs between 2013 and 2016 and made a new grant of 70 million CAD to UNICEF for VAS programs between 2016 and 2020.170

Due to declines in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, granting 70 million CAD over four years rather than three years, and an increase in the proportion of the grant intended to cover immunization activities, it appears that Global Affairs Canada is now granting considerably less funding per year for VAS programs in total than it did between 2013 and 2016.170

Our understanding is that prior to 2016, Global Affairs Canada was the only large funder supporting the implementation of VAS programs, and that no other major funders have begun supporting VAS programs since 2016.172

### Helen Keller as an organization

We use qualitative assessments of our top charities to inform our funding recommendations. See this page for more information about this process and for our qualitative assessment of Helen Keller as an organization.
