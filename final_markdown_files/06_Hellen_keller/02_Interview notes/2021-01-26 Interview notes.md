## Summary

GiveWell spoke with Helen Keller and UNICEF as part of its investigation into a potential grant to Helen Keller to support vitamin A supplementation (VAS) in Cameroon. Conversation topics included goals and resources available for VAS in Cameroon, avenues for VAS implementation, how and why certain regions are prioritized, and funding gaps.

## VAS programming in Cameroon

VAS programming, including but not limited to VAS campaigns, is an important priority for the government and its partners in Cameroon due to the country's high child mortality rate, and is among the first activities that UNICEF aims to fund each year. UNICEF and Helen Keller's support for VAS is aligned with the goals of the Cameroonian government, which considers micronutrient deficiency reduction a pillar of its overall nutrition strategy. The government's goal is to provide VAS twice a year for children under five years old. Helen Keller has supported VAS in Cameroon for about 25 years. Other nutritional priorities for the government of Cameroon include nutrition in emergencies and decreasing stunting among children through a large-scale, multisectoral, nutrition-sensitive operation plan.

## Current funding sources for nutrition programming

There is limited government funding available for nutrition work in Cameroon. Currently, funding for most activities comes from the government's partners, including UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), World Food Programme (WFP), and large non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Helen Keller. Partner organizations frequently advocate within the higher levels of government to carve out a budget specifically for nutrition to go beyond salaries for the health/nutrition staff and some nutrition-sensitive interventions.

### How VAS is implemented in Cameroon

#### Routine health service delivery

VAS is integrated into routine health service delivery for children aged six to 11 months. Children in this age group may receive VAS during their six-month or nine-month routine health system contacts, or if they visit a clinic for any other reason during this time. According to UNICEF and Helen Keller, VAS coverage of this population through routine delivery is around 80% for the first semester 2020. The immunization calendar for children has been expanded up to two years, which will involve adding another measles vaccination contact at 15 months (thus providing another opportunity to administer VAS). However, this expansion would still leave many children aged 24 to 59 months without a routine source of VAS; reaching these children would require stand-alone VAS campaigns or integrating VAS into community health platforms.

#### Bottlenecks to expanding routine VAS

The government and its partners have shown willingness to integrate VAS into routine care for children up to 23 months, and expanded VAS has been piloted. The primary bottleneck is lack of funding. Additionally, because of the importance of reaching children with VAS on schedule, Helen Keller and UNICEF have continued to rely heavily on campaigns to achieve and maintain adequate coverage.

#### Integration into national immunization or other mass distribution campaigns

To expand coverage nationwide, Cameroon often incorporates VAS into existing national immunization efforts, such as polio or measles immunization campaigns. National measles campaigns generally take place once every three to five years in Cameroon; the last one was two years ago, and the next one will likely be in 2024. UNICEF also once integrated VAS into a mass distribution of antimalarial bednets. UNICEF may also integrate VAS into National Immunization Days, which are supposed to take place annually but do not always happen on schedule. These are door-to-door campaigns.

#### Stand-alone VAS campaigns

Stand-alone VAS campaigns are generally too costly to be feasibly implemented by UNICEF alone. A stand-alone campaign was implemented in the Far North and North regions only in December 2020, at a cost of $300,000, but this was an exception and would not be possible to do every year.

### Prioritization by region

In line with government goals, UNICEF aims to reach all 10 regions of Cameroon each year with VAS programming, usually by integrating VAS into a national campaign. However, for several reasons this goal may not be achievable, in which case UNICEF prioritizes four of the 10 regions: North, Far North, East, and Adamawa. These regions are UNICEF's primary targets based on their high rates of vitamin A deficiency and child mortality.

#### Reasons for limiting VAS to certain regions

Insufficient funding is one reason VAS in Cameroon may be limited to these four regions. However, a more common reason is lack of an available systematic national platform in which to integrate a VAS component. In the past year, restrictions on mass drug administration due to the COVID-19 pandemic posed an additional hurdle. A VAS and polio campaign scheduled for March 2020 was cancelled due to COVID-19; this was partially substituted by the stand-alone VAS campaign in the Far North and North regions in December 2020. If there is no national platform available, UNICEF tries to conduct stand-alone VAS campaigns in priority regions using the funding it has, rather than cancelling VAS campaigns outright. Because of limited coverage in 2020, UNICEF aims to achieve at least 90% coverage in both of the 2021 VAS campaigns.

#### Helen Keller's prioritization among regions

Helen Keller would ideally like to support all 10 regions in Cameroon in order to maximize coverage. However, Helen Keller follows UNICEF's guidance to determine where nutrition programming is most needed. This has led it to prioritize the North, Far North, East, and Adamawa regions for VAS support.

#### Funding gaps

Supplies of vitamin A capsules for both 2021 VAS campaigns in Cameroon will be covered via in-kind donations. The funding gap lies in operational costs. Using funds from Global Affairs Canada (GAC), UNICEF will contribute to cover operational costs for the first campaign of the year, which will be administered via a National Immunization Day in April in all 10 regions. For the second campaign of the year, UNICEF does not have funding to cover operational costs, nor a confirmed national campaign in which to integrate VAS delivery.

#### How funding gaps are determined

Funding needs can remain very uncertain until the last minute. UNICEF did not know how the first campaign of 2021 would be funded as recently as the end of December 2020; two weeks after that, it learned of the opportunity to integrate VAS into the April National Immunization Day and was able to get top-up funds from GAC. Budgets for VAS campaigns may also vary considerably depending on the platform used and the geographical coverage. Integrating VAS into the April National Immunization Day, covering all 10 regions, is expected to cost $150,000, while a dedicated VAS campaign in only four regions could cost $500,000. Not knowing what platform may be available for the campaign makes it difficult to estimate funding needs.

### Possible funding sources

UNICEF is unsure whether it will receive funding for VAS from GAC in the future, or how much. If UNICEF does receive a new GAC allocation, it expects that the priority use of that funding will be to stimulate demand for expanded VAS and increase coverage up to 23 months via routine delivery, not to cover the costs of the second campaign of 2021.
