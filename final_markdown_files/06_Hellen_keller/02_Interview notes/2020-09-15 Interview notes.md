## Summary

GiveWell spoke with Dr. Klemm and Mr. Fiedler of HKI as part of its investigation into neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS). Conversation topics included the biological basis for NVAS, overview of existing research and current expert thinking on NVAS, plausibility of harm from NVAS, and barriers to adoption.

### Biological basis for NVAS

Vitamin A is a powerful, almost hormone-like essential nutrient that assists in a range of functions, including lung function. Children are born with low liver stores of the nutrient and depend on external sources, primarily breast milk, to ensure adequate vitamin A in the first several weeks of life. The vitamin A concentration in breast milk from mothers deficient in vitamin A may be inadequate to meet the infant's needs. Studies have suggested that supplementation for postpartum mothers in deficient populations increases the concentration of retinol (a form of vitamin A) in breast milk and raises vitamin A levels in their children. However, some mothers and children in these studies remained deficient despite maternal supplementation (see, for example, Rice, Stoltzfus et al. 1999). It is possible that the deficiency thresholds used for adults are not applicable to very young children, and therefore results indicating deficiency might be misleading. Dr. Klemm is uncertain as to whether liver stores of vitamin A at birth also vary depending on maternal deficiency during pregnancy, but believes research has been done to address this question.

## Overview of research and current thinking on NVAS

Experts are divided on the effectiveness of NVAS. Although early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Asia suggested a benefit, evidence from later trials including African populations have not shown a benefit. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently does not recommend vitamin A supplementation for newborns, but is in the process of reviewing new data and possibly modifying its position on newborn vitamin A supplementation.

### Evidence from early RCTs

A study in Indonesia, which looked at the safety of giving newborns relatively high doses of vitamin A, incidentally found a large reduction in mortality in the treated group, and no evidence of increased risk of intracranial pressure. A later study in Tamil Nadu, India, looking specifically at mortality after six months, also found a significant mortality reduction in the treatment group. After the Tamil Nadu trial, Dr. Klemm and other researchers at Johns Hopkins University nested a study of the effects of NVAS into an ongoing 60,000-pregnancy study in Bangladesh. Because most women in Bangladesh give birth at home, the nested study used a birth surveillance system, in which community health workers would dose the infants with vitamin A during home visits, then alert the research team. Follow-ups were scheduled for six months after the dosing. Because the nested study found a significant reduction in mortality in the treatment group, the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee for the study recommended that the study be terminated early so that infants in the control arm could also benefit from the intervention. With conclusive evidence of the benefits of newborn vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh, Hopkins researchers began advocating for the Bangladeshi government to pilot the intervention in a real-life program setting before taking the intervention to scale.

### WHO trials

Subsequently, WHO commissioned three trials, funded by the Gates Foundation, on the effects of NVAS in Tanzania, Ghana, and India. Dr. Klemm and his colleagues had recommended conducting studies on NVAS in settings with high infant mortality and known maternal vitamin A deficiency. However, the African populations studied had little evidence of maternal deficiency, and these trials showed no reduction in mortality; the Ghana study showed a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in mortality in the treatment group. The study in Haryana, India, where there was evidence of moderate maternal deficiency, showed a moderate reduction in mortality. WHO assembled a group to pool the existing data on NVAS and conduct a meta-analysis, but ultimately did not update its guidance to recommend NVAS.

### Plausibility of harm from NVAS

Some of the evidence from studies of NVAS in African settings indicates no benefit and possible harm to treated newborns. However, Dr. Klemm does not see a biological basis for harm from NVAS. In the studies conducted by Dr. Klemm and his colleagues, newborns received 50,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A, several times more than a child's recommended daily amount. The vitamin A was also delivered in the form of palmitate, which is absorbed as an ester. This has raised concerns of increased intracranial pressure, one symptom of which is thought to be a bulging fontanel (soft spot) on the infant's head, indicating that the cranium is compensating for increased pressure. Bulging fontanel has been reported in a small percentage of newborns receiving high doses of vitamin A, including in the Indonesia study that identified an incidental mortality benefit. However, this study's authors concluded that bulging fontanel was a transient physiological response to increased intracranial volume and was not associated with increased morbidity. In the study led by Dr. Klemm in Bangladesh, medical doctors were sent to follow up with each of the 16,000 participating infants, and no difference in harmful effects (such as bulging fontanel or vomiting) was reported among the treatment group. In addition, the increased mortality risk found by the Ghana study was âˆ¼12% but was not statistically significant (Relative Risk was 1.12, 95% CI 0.95-1.33). Because of these factors, Dr. Klemm believes the evidence from African settings regarding excess mortality risk associated with newborn vitamin A is likely to be statistical noise. However, because the intervention targets very young children, a high degree of caution is warranted.

### Role of deficiency source in diagnosis and treatment

One obstacle to correctly diagnosing vitamin A deficiency is fluctuation in levels of different proteins during illness. Vitamin A is transported within the body by retinol-binding protein (RBP). In the presence of an infection, RBP is sequestered by the liver (possibly because the liver requires amino acids in RBP to fight the infection), while levels of ferritin, an iron-storage protein, increase. This occurs regardless of the infected person's deficiency status for these nutrients before the illness. At the same time, the infection produces markers of inflammation in the form of elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and alphaglycoprotein (AGP). To Dr. Klemm's knowledge, most rapid tests for vitamin A deficiency do not control for the presence of CRP and AGP, which could help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. However, this is complicated by the fact that a child with an infection is likely to be vitamin-deficient to begin with, and infection also has an effect on diet and the way the body uses vitamins. In a recent deficiency-screening study in Bangladesh, Dr. Klemm and his colleagues observed high levels of deficiency and low levels of inflammatory proteins such as CRP and AGP. This suggested that the deficiency was largely due to inadequate diet, not illness. If high levels of inflammatory proteins had been present, it would have been harder to determine if the deficiency was due to diet, frequent illness, or a combination. It is also possible that supplementation's effects could vary depending on the cause of the deficiency. Vitamin A plays an important role in the body's immune response, and there is renewed interest in studying its effects in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other researchers who specialize in immune response and biochemical function may be more knowledgeable about this.

### Barriers to adoption

#### Administration in a home setting

Mortality among newborns is highest in the first week of life. To maximize benefit from NVAS, newborns must be dosed within a few days of birth, which can be challenging in settings where most women give birth at home. Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period. The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.

#### Absence of WHO guidance

Because WHO does not recommend NVAS, persuading governments to implement this intervention can be challenging.

#### Access to proper dosage

To Dr. Klemm's knowledge, there is no commercial manufacturer of vitamin A in the 50,000-IU dose used in trials. The WHO-recommended dose used in current supplementation campaigns is 100,000 IU for children aged six to 11 months and 200,000 IU for children aged 12 to 59 months.

#### Packaging and storage

How the newborn vitamin A dose is packaged and delivered can affect the cost of the intervention. If the vitamin A is administered at the time of birth to women giving birth in a health facility, or by a health worker during a postpartum visit, newborn vitamin A doses can be packaged in inexpensive plastic bottles. If, however, the vitamin A supplements are pre-delivered to a home of an expectant mother or given to a woman at an antenatal visit (for her to store until the birth of her baby), appropriate packaging will be required for each capsule, and this may be costly, adding to the overall cost of the intervention.

#### Path to delivering the intervention at scale

Despite the lack of WHO guidance and uncertainty around the evidence, there is an opportunity for an interested donor to fund NVAS at scale. This would require identifying a setting with at least a moderate level of vitamin A deficiency among women, as well as high levels of neonatal mortality. Once a setting has been chosen, one possible initial approach might be to focus on facility deliveries only, which would make administration easier. In many countries, facility deliveries are becoming more common; in Nepal, for example, more than half of children are born in an attended facility. In short, some work would need to be done to ensure operational feasibility, possibly including operational pilot programs.
