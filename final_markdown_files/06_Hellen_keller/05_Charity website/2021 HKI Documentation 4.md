## Step 1: Before starting

Wash hands with soap and water

### Step 2: Obtaining relevant information from the care giver

* Ask the age of the child to determine the appropriate dose of vitamin A (6-59 months) and whether the child is old enough for a deworming tablet (12-59 months).

### Step 3: Administering a Vitamin A supplement to a child

* Make sure the child is calm and request the caregiver to hold the child.
* Hold the vitamin A capsule upright with the nipple pointing up.
* Cut the nipple with a clean pair of scissors to open the capsule while it is still in the upright position.
* Squeeze all the contents (oil drops) of the vitamin A capsule into child's mouth.
* Throw the empty capsule into a dustbin.

### Remember:

If the distribution point runs out of red (200,000 IU) capsules, two blue (100,000 IU) capsules can be given in place of one red capsule. If the distribution points runs out of blue capsules squeeze half the number of drops from a red capsule into the mouth of a child aged 6-11 months.

### Step 4: Administering a deworming tablet to a child

* For children aged 12-59 months, ask the caretaker to tell the child to chew and swallow the deworming tablet.
* **If the child cannot chew the tablet**, crush it preferably between two spoons or use a spoon and a cup, and add a small amount of clean water to form a paste. With assistance of the caregiver, give the paste to the child.

### Remember:

Never force a child to take a deworming tablet, as there is a serious risk that the child will choke on the tablet. If the child is upset, request the caregiver to wait until the child is ready to receive the tablet.
