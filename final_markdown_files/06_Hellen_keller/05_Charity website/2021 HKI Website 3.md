###### Abstract

In this thesis, we propose a new method for estimating the number of variables in a given set of variables. We show that the number of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set of variables in a given set
