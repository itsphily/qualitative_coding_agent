**Vitamin A**

**Why Vitamin A supplementation?**

**Research has demonstrated that the twice-yearly provision of high dose of vitamin A supplements to at least 80% of the children aged from 6 months to 5 years reduces their mortality by up to 24%. It also prevents blindness and reinforces the immune system, thus protecting from measles.**

**Because of such strong evidence, the WHO recommends that all children aged 6 to 59 months are supplemented every 4 to 6 months with high dose Vitamin A supplements everywhere Vitamin A deficiency is a public health concern.**

**Vitamin A deficiency remains very high in Sub Saharan Africa, with most recent estimates suggesting that up to 48% of children under five are vitamin A deficient in the region.**

**Mortality affecting children under five years of age has seen a significant decline over the last decade, but still remains unacceptably high in most countries of Sub Saharan Africa. Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is therefore still highly needed in most Sub Saharan African countries.**

**What has been achieved so far?**

**Helen Keller international (HKI) has been at the forefront of VAS since the 1990's, supporting the research that revealed the major impact of VAS on mortality and then supporting the sharp increase of coverage of VAS in up to 16 countries (13 currently) of Sub-Saharan Africa and helping most of them reach up to 95% coverage among children under five years in the last years.**

**HKI approaches ensuring equity and focus on Hard To Reach populations often contributed to reach the 95% coverage. To achieve such results, HKI supported national and sub-national governments in designing and implementing the most cost effective delivery models for their contexts. Through these models, HKI has supported the distribution of close to 300 million vitamin A capsules in the last five years.**

**Abstract**

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the problem of maximizing the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective function of the objective**
