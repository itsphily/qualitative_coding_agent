Objectives and process

The objective of Supportive Supervision [SS] is to improve performance of services through a series of steps:

1. Assess the performance of the services with the service provider (give the opportunity to the service provider to analyze his own practice as you fill up the checklist);
2. Identify areas of good performance and areas of insufficient performance, and acknowledge them both;
3. Identify the reasons for insufficient performance with the service provider and identify solutions together for improving performance;
4. Set an action plan that is time bound, measurable and achievable with the service provider and ensure that both supervisor and service provider sign off on it;
5. Re-assess the performance after a period agreed with the service provider and the achievement of the actions agreed upon by re-starting at step 1. Make sure you consider the results of the previous SS exercise in the actions identified below. Also make sure the actions are proposed and agreed upon by the service provider and the facility in - charge

* **Principles** *
- The SS checklist should be administered by supervisors in charge of the facility or a member of the health management team at county or district level. It can also be managed by external actors with agreement from local health authorities.
- SS should not be conducted once only. A follow up visit should be planned in advance to measure progress 3 to 6 months after the first visit.
- All facilities in a county or district should be visited at least once a year, with more visits for services showing the lowest level of performance.
- District or county managers as well as facility supervisors should at least have a book to register dates of SS for each facility, score achieved and next visits to be organized.
- The supportive supervision should last at least 2 hours to ensure that the supervisor has the time to verify all documents and make visual observations of services provided and provide feedback to the team supervised.
* **How to fill the checklist** *
- As many comments as possible should be added for each row: scores are just one indication to provide a visual tool for measuring improvement of performance, but comments are the essential aspect that will help identify issues and solutions. This tool is a qualitative tool as much as a quantitative one so it is important to give as many details as possible for each observation.
- All answers and scoring should be confirmed by visual observation:
  - If the service provider answers positively to the existence of a plan for outreach, he should be able to show the plan.
  - Social mobilization should be confirmed by the actors in charge of it, not just by the service provider.

Reporting should be confirmed by documents.
* Quality of service delivery questions should be confirmed by visual observations.
