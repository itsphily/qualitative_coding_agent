MORE THAN 868 MILLION CHILDREN

{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/276933/WER9350.pdf?uq=1} ARE AT RISK OF PARASITIC WORM INFECTIONS. WE HELP REACH OVER 280 MILLION OF THEM ANNUALLY - FOR LESS THAN US 50 CENTS PER TREATMENT. An eight-time GiveWell top charity (https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative), our Deworm the World Initiative combats worm infections by working with governments to deliver mass school-based deworming programs. Since 2014, we have supported governments to deliver over 1 billion treatments, which are proven to improve the nutrition, cognition, school attendance, and long-term economic prospects of children. "OF THE DEWORMING CHARITIES WE HAVE EVALUATED, [DEWORM THE WORLD] HAS THE STRONGEST TRACK RECORD OF DEMONSTRATING THAT ITS PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE." - GiveWell, 2018

Parasitic worm infections, technically known as soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis, spread primarily in areas with inadequate sanitation - affecting poor communities around the world. These infections interfere with children's nutrient uptake, often leading to anemia, malnourishment, and impaired mental and physical development. As a result, infection means that children are less likely to attend school, adversely affecting educational outcomes. **Regular treatment with a simple pill is universally recognized as a safe and effective solution to combat these infections.**

Our Deworm the World Initiative helps bring the treatment for free to children at their schools instead of placing the burden on the families to obtain it. We partner with governments to regularly treat all at-risk children in places where at least 20% are infected with worms, as recommended by the World Health Organization. **School-based deworming works by freeing children from worm infection, improving their health and enabling them to attend school regularly.**

. It leverages existing education infrastructure, making it easy to reach children. Teachers are trusted by their communities and can be easily trained to administer medication.

Our program has scaled rapidly: we've gone from reaching \(35\) million children to reaching over \(280\) million today, by supporting governments to conduct school-based dewowing. Providing regular treatment has reduced worm infections in these geographies, improving life outcomes for hundreds of millions of children. (https://www.evidenceaction.org)

"A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT DEWORMING WORK's FROME CHILDREN'S HEALTH, WELL-BEING, EDUCATION, AND LONG TERM ECONOMIC FUTURE." - WHO, 2016

Independent rigorous research, including by Nobel Laureate Michael Hetner, shows that deforming" leads to **significant improvements in nutrition, cognition, school participation, and future earnings**. Here is a summary of key research findings:

* A meta-analysis found that deworming programs lead to an average weight gain of 0.3kg in children (https://www.nber.org/papers/w22382), equivalent to moving a three-year-old from the 25th to the 50th percentile of WHO child growth standards. * Children who were less than one year old when their siblings received deworming treatment show significant cognitive gains comparable to between 0.5 and 0.8 years of schooling (http://economics.ozier.com/owen/papers/ozier_early_deworming_20150417e.pdf). * A randomized controlled trial in Western Kenya (http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/1/Identifying-Impacts-on-Education-and-Health-in-the-Presence-of-Treatment-Externalities.pdf) found that children who received deworming had a 25% reduction in school absenteeism, when compared to those who did not. * Following those same children in Kenya, researchers found that receiving two to three additional years of deworming increased their income by 13% and consumption by 14% two decades after treatment (http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/research/twenty-year-economic-impacts-of-deworming). More details on this study can be found in this blog. (https://www.evidenceaction.org/press-release-the-44-cent-treatment-that-dramatically-changed-lives-in-kenya/)
* A study using historical data from the United States (https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/1/73/1924773) in the 1910s found that parasitic worms could have explained as much as 22% of the early income gap between the North and South. You can delve deeper into the evidence in this blog (https://www.evidenceaction.org/a-summary-of-the-deworming-evidence-base/) that summarizes much of the existing research regarding deworming, and this one (https://www.evidenceaction.org/press-release-the-44-cent-treatment-that-dramatically-changed-lives-in-kenya/) that discusses the 20 year deworming impacts study.

## Abstract

In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to solve the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution to the problem of finding a solution

We get involved from program inception--advocating with policymakers about the need and importance of school-based deworming--and with their buy-in, collaborating program, iterate to improve it, and ensure program goals are met.

## Systems

We create a set of systems to help governments launch, scale, and sustain high-quality deworming programs, and rigorously monitor and assess them to enable regular improvements. With this model, we have achieved unparalleled impact at a lower cost than virtually any other organization conducting deworming programs.

### 1. Policy and Advocacy

We advocate with governments to launch deworming programs, and work collaboratively with ministries of health and education to establish effective policies and governance structures. We support alignment of school-based deworming with other health and education priorities to enable long-term political and resource commitments, and share global best practices to improve cost-effectiveness and results.
