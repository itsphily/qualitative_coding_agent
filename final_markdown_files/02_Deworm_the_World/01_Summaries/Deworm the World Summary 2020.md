**Does it work? ** We believe that there is strong evidence that administration of deworming drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a **priority program** given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. Deworm the World sends monitors to schools during and, for most distributions, after deworming to determine whether the programs it supports have reached a large proportion of children targeted. We have reviewed data from each of its major programs, which overall indicate strong results. (**More**)

**What do you get for your dollar? ** Our best guess is that deworming is generally highly cost-effective. We estimate that, in Kenya, the cost per child dewormed is about $0.66 per child, or $0.46 per child excluding in-kind contributions from governments. We estimate that the cost per child treated in India is roughly half of that. We expect the cost per treatment in other countries to be closer to that in Kenya than India, and may be more expensive in the early stages of a program. The number of lives significantly improved is a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss in detail in a **separate report**. (**More**)

of the sections below.

## What do they do?

The Deworm the World Initiative is a program led by

Evidence Action, an organization that focuses on scaling up

interventions that it believes are cost-effective and

evidence-based. Deworm the World advocates for and

supports the implementation of government-run

deworming programs for preschool- and school-age

children.3 The support that Deworm the World provides is

of two types: 1) offering technical assistance to

governments implementing deworming, and 2) funding

components of deworming programs.4

The deworming programs that Deworm the World

supports are focused on executing school-based mass drug

administrations (MDAs), in which the aim is to treat the

entire population of children within a geographic area by

distributing deworming pills.5 Deworm the World focuses

on MDAs that treat children infected with soil-transmitted

helminthiasis (STH).6 Where needed, these programs also

include treatment for schistosomiasis.7

In the countries it works in, Deworm the World works primarily with government staff to implement deworming programs; as it has expanded to new countries, it has started to also collaborate with non-governmental partners to support governments.8 Deworm the World has also funded or is considering working on a few projects that fall outside of its purview of supporting the direct implementation of deworming programs, specifically related to monitoring and research (see footnote).9

Deworm the World was founded in 2007,10 and as of 2020 had supported deworming treatments in India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Vietnam and Pakistan.11 Many of these programs are recent and represent progress on Evidence Action's efforts to scale up Deworm the World; as of early 2015, Deworm the World had only supported treatments in India and Kenya. On a separate page with additional information about Deworm the World, we discuss more details of its work by country. Below, we discuss:

A breakdown of Deworm the World's spending

Deworm the World's relationship to Evidence Action

### Deworm the World's role in government-led deworming programs

The deworming programs that Deworm the World supports are implemented by the governments it works with.12 Below, we expand on Deworm the World's role in the programs it supports. Note that we use "Deworming Day" to mean the day on which the MDA takes place. Similarly, we use "Mop-Up Day" to refer to the day that occurs several days after Deworming Day and is when students who were absent or sick on Deworming Day are given their deworming pills (although note that not all countries have just one Deworming Day or include a Mop-Up Day in their program).13

The assistance that Deworm the World provides in each country varies based on what each partnering government needs.14 Historically, Deworm the World's role has included the following:15

1. Advocacy. Deworm the World actively encourages national and large sub-national governments to implement mass school-based deworming programs.16 Our impression is that Deworm the World's advocacy consists of meeting with health and education officials in a government to discuss the benefits of deworming and how a deworming program might be implemented.17 Deworm the World has told us that it will not work with a government on a national deworming program until it has built a strong working relationship with that government via its advocacy.18 Deworm the World also participates in the broader "STH community"; that is, it works with other organizations advocating for and implementing activities that aim to further reduce or eliminate STH globally.19

2. Prevalence surveys. Before Deworm the World helps launch a deworming program in a new area, it evaluates whether the prevalence of worm infections is sufficient to justify an MDA for the school-age population.20 If no prevalence surveys have been conducted recently, it generally commissions one.21 The results of prevalence surveys are used to determine the appropriate treatment strategy (in particular, MDA frequency) for a given location.22 It also plans to conduct follow-up prevalence surveys periodically, so that it can track the impact of the MDAs and refine treatment strategies as needed, in accordance with WHO guidelines.23 Deworm the World generally contracts out work on prevalence surveys.24

3. High-level program planning. Deworm the World has told us that it often assists governments with high-level operational decisions, such as developing the country's treatment strategy and operational guidelines25 and creating a budget for the program.26

4. Drug procurement and protocols. Deworm the World assists governments in obtaining drugs, designing drug distribution and tracking processes, and developing adverse event protocols for cases where children react poorly to treatment.27 For example, Deworm the World has helped governments submit requests for deworming drugs (albendazole or praziquantel) to the World Health Organization (WHO) global drug donation program.28

5. Program preparation: trainings and distribution of materials. Deworm the World has helped governments design and organize what it calls a "training cascade" (more detail in the footnote).29 Through the training cascade, teachers and other government staff learn how to implement a Deworming Day and receive materials necessary for implementation (such as reporting forms and drugs).30 In the past, Deworm the World has hired or trained staff to lead the trainings and developed materials for the trainings.31 In India, Deworm the World has also arranged tele-callers to reach out to schools to assess their preparedness and notify government officials of any problems before Deworming Day.32

6. Community sensitization. Deworm the World supports community sensitization efforts, which aim to make local communities aware of Deworming Day and the benefits of deworming children.33 For example, via the training cascade, teachers are instructed to spread the word about Deworming Day to their communities.34 Deworm the World has also developed text message campaigns, organized public announcement events, and edited mass media materials to be more appropriate for local contexts.35

7. Monitoring and evaluation. Deworm the World told us that it helps governments design or improve reporting and monitoring systems. It also collects monitoring data independently.36 Deworm the World focuses on assisting with the collection of three main types of monitoring data:37

Monitoring before and during deworming:

Monitors hired by Deworm the World visit schools before and during Deworming Day and Mop-Up

Day. They are meant to assess both a) how prepared schools and health systems are to implement deworming and b) the extent to which proper procedures are followed.38 Monitoring visits may include assessments of the quality of trainings, community sensitization efforts, and Deworming Day activities, depending on what Deworm the World and the government agree to monitor.39

Coverage reporting: On Deworming Day and Mop-Up Day, teachers are asked to mark the number of children that they deworm and schools complete specially designed reporting forms to tally the number of children treated. This data is then aggregated and reported by school staff to government officials.

Our understanding is that data is generally aggregated stepwise by officials at several levels (e.g., in India: school, node, block, district, and state) to create a reported coverage estimate for a region.40 Deworm the World notes that, more recently, block officials in India have submitted coverage data online to the national government.41

Coverage validation: Approximately one week after Mop-Up Day, Deworm the World sends independent monitors back to schools to check the coverage data and attendance records recorded at schools against the data submitted and ask students about whether or not they were dewormed.42 This data can then be compared to the coverage data reported by the government.

Typically, Deworm the World hires and trains third-party monitors to collect process monitoring and coverage validation data; the following footnote includes Deworm the World's descriptions of the monitor selection process used in four states in India in 2015.43 In Kenya, Evidence Action (Deworm the World's parent organization) maintains a monitoring team year-round that Deworm the World makes use of.44

On a separate page, we detail Deworm the World's work by country.

Breakdown of Deworm the World's spending

We summarize Deworm the World's spending for 2017, 2018, and 2019 in this spreadsheet. In short:

* Deworm the World spent a total of $13.9 million on deworming programs in 2019, up from $11.4 million in 2018.45

In 2019, about 40% of its spending was from funding sources that are restricted to a particular project. This restricted funding primarily supported programs in India and Kenya, which are funded by CIFF, the END Fund, EPIC Foundation UK and EPIC Foundation France, and Dubai Cares.46 The other 60% of funding was from funds that Deworm the World can allocate at its discretion (this includes GiveWell-directed funds). Deworm the World primarily used this unrestricted funding to fully support its programs in Nigeria and Pakistan and to support a portion of program costs in India and Kenya. Deworm the World's biggest program in 2019 (and historically) was in India (accounting for 55% of its program spending). Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan accounted for 13-17% of Deworm the World's program spending each, and Ethiopia and Vietnam for less than 1% each.47

For information on spending in previous periods, see the previous versions of our review of Deworm the World.

Deworm the World and Evidence Action

In early 2013, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) announced the formation of Evidence Action to scale cost-effective and evidence-based programs. Two IPA initiatives, Deworm the World and Dispensers for Safe Water, were spun off from IPA to be managed by Evidence Action. Evidence Action subsequently built a department for investigating, testing, and considering new programs for scaling up called Evidence Action Beta; one program in the Beta portfolio was No Lean Season, which GiveWell also recommended as a top charity in 2017.48 We removed No Lean Season from our list of top charities in 2018; see this blog post for more detail. In 2019, Evidence Action replaced Evidence Action Beta with Evidence Action Accelerator, which will continue the work of developing new programs. We focus this review on Deworm the World and discuss the room for more funding implications of Deworm the World being a program of a larger organization below.

Does it work?

We believe that there is strong evidence that administration of deworming drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a priority program given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. We believe the evidence from Deworm the World's monitoring makes a relatively strong case that the programs it has supported have successfully dewormed children. Here we focus on Deworm the World's monitoring from Kenya, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan because those are its largest programs.49 Deworm the World's track record in Kenya and India is strong. Deworm the World's track record in Nigeria and Pakistan is more limited, but what we have seen seems fairly strong. In the sections below, we focus on the following questions to understand whether Deworm the World's activities are having the intended impact. Are mass school-based deworming programs effective when implemented well?

Are mass school-based
deworming programs effective
when implemented well?

Deworm the World supports mass school-based deworming programs, the independent evidence for which we discuss extensively in our intervention report on deworming programs. In short, we believe that there is strong evidence that administration of the drugs reduces worm loads but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes; we consider deworming a priority program given the possibility of strong benefits at low cost. There are some important differences between the type and severity of worm infections in the places Deworm the World works and the places where the key studies on improved life outcomes from deworming took place (which we discuss below). In particular, Deworm the World primarily provides support to mass drug administrations (MDAs) that treat populations in which fewer children are infected with soil-transmitted helminths and where the severity of infections tends to be lower (as compared to populations in the key studies we refer to above). In addition, some of the programs Deworm the World supports do not treat schistosomiasis because it is not endemic in the areas the programs support.50

Are Deworm the World's programs targeted at areas of need? What is the likely impact per treatment in Deworm the World's programs compared with the independent studies on the impact of deworming?

In general, mass deworming programs treat everyone in a targeted demographic, regardless of whether each individual is infected (more). Because of this, the benefits (and therefore the cost-effectiveness) of a program are highly dependent on the baseline prevalence of worm infections. In this section, we discuss how the disease burden in the areas Deworm the World works in compares to the places where the independent studies that form the evidence base for the impact of deworming were conducted. While it is our understanding that Deworm the World programs generally target areas that require mass treatment according to WHO guidelines,51 the disease burden in Deworm the World areas is on average lower than in the study areas, so our expectation is that the impact per child treated is lower in Deworm the World areas. We adjust our cost-effectiveness estimate accordingly (more below). In this spreadsheet, we compare the worm prevalence in places where Deworm the World currently supports a program to the prevalence from the studies providing the best evidence for the benefits of deworming. The prevalences in the table may not be directly comparable to one another. Prevalence surveys were conducted in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh after multiple rounds of treatment, in Bihar and Rajasthan after one round of treatment, and in Uttar Pradesh after multiple rounds of treatment in some districts.52 It is likely that prevalence was higher at baseline for these regions. Deworm the World notes that with a few exceptions, it conducts prevalence surveys prior to supporting treatment.53

Deworm the World notes that there are relevant methodological differences between the prevalence surveys, which makes them difficult to compare;54 we agree that this data is not ideal for our purposes but believe that it provides the best estimate we have and adjusting for baseline infection rates is an important part of our cost-effectiveness model. Treatment for lymphatic filarias

In some of the countries where Deworm the World works, there are existing programs to treat lymphatic filariasis (LF).55 Albendazole, the same drug used to treat STH, is usually used in combination with one additional drug to treat LF (and the same dosage is used for both treatments).56 For areas that have existing LF treatment programs, the effect of Deworm the World's support may be to transition an area from once-per-year deworming treatment (for STH) to twice-per-year treatment.57

We detail what we know about the status of LF programs in the areas in which Deworm the World works on a separate page with additional information about Deworm the World.

Are deworming pills delivered to and ingested by recipients?

The information we have seen from monitors hired and trained by Deworm the World in India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan suggests that the programs successfully deliver pills to children, who then swallow them. Additionally, prevalence surveys in Kenya, and to a lesser degree Bihar, India, show that the prevalence rates of STH and schistosomiasis have declined substantially since Deworm the World started supporting MDAs in those areas, providing additional evidence that the treatments are reaching recipients.

Evidence from monitoring

Deworm the World conducts monitoring to assess the quality of program implementation ("process monitoring") and to evaluate government reports of what proportion of the target population was reached with deworming treatment in the previous MDA ("coverage validation"). We use results from past MDAs to understand the impact we should expect future MDAs to have. Specifically, we use coverage validation results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the cost of reaching a child with deworming. Our interpretation of these coverage validation results is informed by their comprehensiveness and the methodology used to collect them.

Comprehensiveness

See this spreadsheet for all process monitoring and coverage validation results we have seen from Deworm the World's programs in India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. We focus our review on coverage validation results, which we believe provide the best indication of program impact. Specifically, we focus on results from India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan because those are Deworm the World's largest programs.59 We have seen coverage validation results from 2014-19 in Kenya and from 2015-19 in India; over the years, we have reviewed these results to varying degrees of depth due to their high degree of consistency across years. We have also reviewed coverage validation results from 2018-19 in Nigeria and 2019 in Pakistan, which was the first year that Deworm the World supported a program in that location. In general, in locations in Nigeria and Pakistan where Deworm the World has supported two deworming rounds per year,60 it has only conducted coverage validation for one of the two rounds, but conducted process monitoring for all rounds.61 We thus believe that we have seen a relatively thorough picture of the impact of Deworm the World's programs; we incorporate this assessment into our cost-effectiveness model.

Methodology

For each of its programs, Deworm the World hires monitors (who are not associated with the government implementing the program) to:63

* [Sometimes] Make calls to communities and schools before Deworming Day. In India, Deworm the World asks monitors to call, unannounced, a random selection of schools and/or communities before Deworming Day. During the calls, monitors interview teachers, headmasters, and other functionalities, asking a variety of questions to assess preparedness, such as whether or not the school has enough treatments for Deworming Day and if a representative from the school attended training.64
* Observe activities on Deworming Day and Mop-Up Day. In all of its programs, Deworm the World sends its monitors, unannounced, to observe a random sample of schools on Deworming Day and Mop-Up Day.65 At the schools, monitors interview teachers and school administrators to assess how prepared the school was for Deworming Day.

For example, monitors often ask if the school has sufficient drugs for Deworming Day, whether or not a school representative attended training, and a variety of questions to test teachers' knowledge about the proper procedures for the MDA campaign, such as what the teacher should do if a child is feeling sick.66 Then, the monitors observe randomly selected classes, recording details about the Deworming Day activities, such as whether deworming is in progress, teachers are documenting who is dewormed, and teachers are watching to make sure that students swallow the pills.67 In Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan, monitors visit communities surrounding schools, select a sample of adults to interview, and ask questions to assess their awareness of Deworming Day. This helps Deworm the World determine how successful its community sensitization efforts were.68

* Conduct a coverage validation exercise. In India and Kenya, Deworm the World has typically sent out monitors within 1 to 2 weeks (though sometimes longer) of Deworming Day and Mop-Up Day to conduct a coverage validation exercise. It has also done so in the two most recent program years in Nigeria and in its first program year in Pakistan.69

In India, coverage validation takes place at a randomly selected sample of schools. In Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan, coverage validation takes place at households as well as schools in order to evaluate coverage for both enrolled and non-enrolled children.70 During household-based coverage validation, households are randomly selected, and then eligible children within households are interviewed about their experience on Deworming Day.71 During school-based coverage validation, monitors randomly select a small sample of students to interview, asking the children questions about their experience on Deworming Day.

which are largely the same questions as those asked during household interviews.72 For example, they ask if the child received a pill and if the child swallowed the pill under supervision.73 In India, monitors also check class registers and record the number of students that were dewormed according to the school or anganwadi center's records.74

In India, Deworm the World interviews only enrolled children who were present on either Deworming Day or Mop-up Day in schools where deworming happened on at least one of those days;75 attendance data is collected separately in India to assess the rate of absenteeism on Deworming Day and Mop-up Day.76 In Kenya, Nigeria, and Vietnam, Deworm the World interviews a sample of all children, regardless of whether they were present on Deworming Day or Mop-up Day or whether they are enrolled or non-enrolled.77

While we believe that Deworm the World's monitoring is overall of high quality, we note a few ways in which its methodology may produce bias in the results:

Process monitoring:

Even though school staff are not aware ahead of time that a monitor is coming to visit, once a monitor arrives, staff may be motivated to execute the program in a more rigorous fashion than they would have otherwise. This potential bias is one of the reasons that we also rely on coverage validation that takes place in a different sample of schools after Deworming Day when assessing the quality of Deworm the World's programs.

Reports we have seen indicate that, in general, monitors observe the deworming process in the vast majority (90% or above) of schools they visit in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan, though there have been some exceptions (detailed in the footnote).78 This rate has been more variable in India, ranging from 24% to 87%.79 Low observation rates could be due to deworming not being in progress at the time the monitors conduct their observations, either because it has already been completed (which Deworm the World notes may often be the case), because it has not started yet, or because it is not taking place that day.80

### Coverage validation:

Deworm the World's program and monitoring are generally done through schools, which may lead non-enrolled children to be missed by the program. Schools are supposed to target and record the treatments they distribute to non-enrolled children.81 Most locations do not have reliable data on how many non-enrolled children there are.82 In Nigeria, Kenya, and Pakistan, Deworm the World's coverage validation has taken place in communities in addition to schools, in order to estimate coverage among all children in the targeted age range, including non-enrolled children.83 For the 2019 coverage validation results we have reviewed from Nigeria and Pakistan, only small samples of non-enrolled children were interviewed in households,84 suggesting that enrollment rates in the surveyed areas were high.85

A potential source of bias in Deworm the World's coverage validation surveys is the surveys' heavy reliance on self-reported responses from children. These responses are at risk of recall bias, though this concern is reduced by the fact that coverage validation has typically been conducted within a few weeks of MDA. They may also be at risk of social desirability bias: it is possible that children may overreport coverage if they feel pressure from teachers to report positively on their administration of deworming treatment, or if children believe that this is the preferred response of data collectors. Coverage validation has generally found very high proportions of students reporting being dewormed, with a coverage rate in one survey of 100%.86 Very high coverage numbers in India may be partially explained by the fact, discussed above, that Deworm the World interviews only children who were present on either Deworming Day or Mop-up Day in schools where deworming occurred on at least one of those days; see footnote for clarification from Deworm the World.87 Deworm the World tries to interview students away from their teachers, to reduce pressure, and also has some checks on students' answers.88 When children are interviewed at home rather than at school, their parents are usually present during the interview.89

## Results

We believe that results from Deworm the World's coverage validation, and to a lesser extent its process monitoring, provide relatively strong evidence that a high proportion of the target population has been reached with deworming treatment in past MDAs. We use coverage validation results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the cost of reaching a child with deworming. See this spreadsheet for all results we have reviewed from Deworm the World's programs. In short:90

In the majority of surveys we have reviewed, coverage of school-aged children was above 75% (the WHO-recommended minimum threshold). Across years, median coverage has been 97% in India (2015-19), 93% in Kenya (2014-19), 80% in Nigeria (2018-19), and 79% in Pakistan (2019). In the spreadsheet, we also report results we have reviewed from Deworm the World's process monitoring on Deworming Day. We have not prioritized reviewing results from the process monitoring Deworm the World conducts _before_ Deworming Day, although we think it could also provide insight as to the quality of Deworm the World's program.

### Evidence from prevalence surveys over time

Deworm the World or its partners have conducted surveys in India and Kenya to track changes in schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity rates following Deworm the World-supported treatment programs. We have reviewed prevalence surveys conducted in Kenya from 2012 to 2016. In general, prevalence and intensity of the parasites decreased over this time period. Our understanding is that the most likely cause of this decrease was the national deworming program, which Deworm the World supports; alternative explanations for the decrease, such as the existence of other large-scale deworming programs or widespread changes in water and sanitation facilities or practices, seem to us to be unlikely. We have also reviewed two surveys of prevalence conducted in Bihar, India, at baseline and after several years of treatment; the results from the surveys are not directly comparable, but point in the direction of the program having an effect on prevalence levels. We discuss methodology, results, and limitations to using these surveys as evidence of Deworm the World's impact on another page. Deworm the World has also shared prevalence surveys conducted in Kenya and in two states in India in 2018. We have not yet reviewed their results or methodology in depth.

## How does Deworm the World affect program outcomes?

Deworm the World may be having an impact in the following ways:

It may increase the likelihood that a government implements a deworming program, by advocating for deworming programs, by offering to provide technical assistance, and/or by funding implementation. Deworm the World expects to pay for the majority of financial program costs in many of the new countries to which it has expanded or intends to expand.91

In situations where Deworm the World is funding a deworming program, we believe it is likely that Deworm the World plays an instrumental role in causing the program to happen.92 Full discussion of the evidence we have reviewed on this question is on a separate page with additional information on Deworm the World. It may improve the quality of a deworming program that would have been implemented without Deworm the World (leading to more children dewormed effectively or improved cost-effectiveness). Our intuition is that Deworm the World's activities increase the quality of the programs it supports, but we are uncertain about this. Full discussion of the evidence we have reviewed on this question is on a separate page with additional information on Deworm the World.

## Are there any negative or offsetting impacts?

In this section, we consider factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that could offset the impact of Deworm the World's programs, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes.

### Drug quality:

If drugs are not stored properly they may lose effectiveness or expire.93 Our understanding is that Deworm the World periodically tests the quality of drugs and has monitored storage conditions in each of its recent programs, and this information suggests there have been minimal issues.94 In India, state governments are responsible for procuring the drugs from local suppliers and quality testing them.95

### Dosage:

If the incorrect dosage is given, the drugs may not have the intended effect and/or children may experience additional side effects.96 It appears that for STH treatment, all children of a given age group are given the same dose of albendazole and that the dose is generally a single tablet for children 2 years old and above, and half a tablet for those between the ages of 1 and 2.97 Deworm the World monitors reported in 2015 (we haven't seen more recent data) that in programs in India, up to 9% of schools observed gave children less than the prescribed dose of albendazole and up to 5% gave more than the prescribed dose of albendazole.98

Replacement of government funding: We have limited information about whether governments would pay for the parts of the program paid for by Deworm the World in its absence, though our impression is that they would not.99 We also have little information about what governments would use deworming funds for if they did not choose to implement deworming programs.

### Diversion of skilled labor:

Drug distribution occurs only once or twice per year and is conducted by teachers in schools.

Based on our site visit in Rajasthan, our impression is that the Nodal Officer (the state official who manages all state school-based programs), the Nodal Officer's staff, and the people that the Nodal Officer manages throughout the state (Resource Persons and Community Development Project Officers) have significant capacity to take on additional programs, so their taking on this program doesn't impose a significant burden on their time.100 On the other hand, a principal we spoke with commented that he would prefer fewer school-based health programs because they take focus away from the school day.101

### Adverse effects and unintended consequences of taking deworming drugs:

Our understanding is that expected side effects are minimal and there is little reason to be concerned that drug resistance is currently a major issue. We note that fainting was common in at least one MDA supported by Deworm the World; this MDA included praziquantel for schistosomiasis, and Deworm the World attributes the fainting cases to students taking the drug with empty stomachs.102 More information in our report on deworming. Popular discontent: We have heard a couple of accounts of discontent in response to mass drug administration campaigns supported by the SCI Foundation, including one case that led to riots.103 Additionally, during deworming activities supported by Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative in Ogun State, Nigeria in December 2017, rumors of students collapsing reportedly generated panic that led some parents to take their children out of school; the Ogun State government denied that any students collapsed.104 During deworming activities supported by Deworm the World in Oyo State, Nigeria in February 2018, rumors of students reacting badly or dying after receiving deworming drugs spread, and several schools canceled Deworming Day; an investigation found that the children likely died of food poisoning unrelated to deworming.105

## What do you get for your dollar? This section examines the data that we have to inform our estimate of the expected cost-effectiveness of additional donations to Deworm the World. Note that the number of lives significantly improved is a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors. We incorporate these into a cost-effectiveness model which is available here. In this section, we focus on the cost per child treated, which is an important input in our cost-effectiveness model. On a separate page, we discuss:

How accurate are Deworm the World's reported coverage figures? Deworm the World uses government-reported figures on the number of treatments delivered when calculating its cost per treatment. We remain uncertain of the accuracy of these figures. More here. Does Deworm the World "leverage" government funds, such that its activities mobilize resources from other actors? We could imagine that Deworm the World's funds have substantial leverage but could also imagine that other actors' involvement is causing Deworm the World to pay for things for which other actors would otherwise have paid. Deworm the World may have less leverage in its future programs than it has had in past programs. More here.

## What is the cost per treatment? 

We estimate that in India children are dewormed for a total of about $0.35 per child, or $0.10 per child excluding the value of teachers' and principals' time spent on the program. In Kenya, we estimate the total cost per treatment at about $0.66 per treatment or $0.46 excluding the value of teachers' and principals' time spent on the program.

We expect the cost per treatment in the countries Deworm the World has expanded to recently and may expand to in the future to be closer to its costs in Kenya in the long run, but higher than its costs in Kenya at first due to additional costs associated with starting a new program. Deworm the World told us that the cost per treatment in India is unusually low.106 We note that Deworm the World's cost per child analysis from Cross River, Nigeria for 2016 was about 50% higher than its estimate for Kenya in 2015-2016.107

## Our approach

Our cost per treatment analyses rely heavily on analyses Deworm the World has done to allocate its own costs across programs, collect data on costs paid by other partners and governments, and estimate costs when data is not available. Deworm the World has told us that it tries to capture all costs of its program, regardless of who pays for the cost (including donated drugs). We have made several adjustments to Deworm the World's estimates:

For India, about two thirds of the total cost comes from contributions of time from government employees--which have been monetized according to salary levels--rather than financial costs. Appropriately valuing that time spent, and estimating how much time is spent by teachers and others due to the deworming program, is likely the largest source of uncertainty in the cost-per-child-treated calculation for India.108 In its own calculations, Deworm the World excludes the value of government employees' time because the government would have incurred these costs in the absence of the program.109

There are a few high-level costs not directly attributable to programs that Deworm the World does not include (such as exploratory work in new geographies that does not lead to a new program).10

We have included an estimate of these costs in our analyses. For Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Vietnam we have included an estimate of in-kind contributions from governments. This estimate is very rough and uses the same approach that we use in estimating the total cost per treatment for SCI. In short, we assume that government contributions account for 30% of the cost of the program, based on a 201 paper that analyzed the costs of an SCI program in Niger.11

We adjust the number of treatments reported by Deworm the World-supported programs by the attendance and coverage rates found in Deworm the World's monitoring. Details of this adjustment are in this spreadsheet. "No. of children devormed" sheets. We start with this total cost figure and apply adjustments in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for cases where we believe the charity's funds have caused other actors to shift funds from a less cost-effective use to a more cost-effective use ("leverage") or from a more cost-effective use to a less cost-effective use ("funging").

## Is there room for more funding? 

We believe that Deworm the World could use more funding than it expects to receive to support its deworming programs in the next three years. In short:

**Available funding:** As of June 2020, Deworm the World held $50.9 million in funding for its deworming programs. It had earmarked all of this funding to support future activities.  
**Expected funding:** We project that Deworm the World will receive $7.9 million that is available to support its work in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan over the next three years.  
**Spending opportunities:** Deworm the World has identified opportunities to spend up to $10.4 million, beyond the funding it currently holds or projects to receive, over the next three years in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In sum, we estimate that Deworm the World could use up to an additional $2.5 million to extend its support of deworming programs in Nigeria and Pakistan through 2023. More details and calculations in **this spreadsheet**. Below, we discuss our approach to assessing Deworm the

## Our approach

In general, we assess top charities' funding needs over a three-year period.12 We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets over the next three years, along with information about their current available funding and funding pipeline. The difference between a charity's three-year budget and the funding we project that it will have available to support that budget is the charity's room for more funding. For this analysis, we focus on the portion of Deworm the World's portfolio supported by funding that can be used flexibly across locations. We exclude the portion of Deworm the World's portfolio supported by funding restricted to specific locations.

## Available funding

As of June 2020, Deworm the World did not hold any uncommitted funding available to support its work. It had $50.9 million in the bank13 and had already committed $54.8 million to future activities (based on an expectation of $3.9 million in future revenue). More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Available and expected funding."

Expected funding

We project that Deworm the World will receive $13.4 million to support its work over the next three years. As mentioned above, $3.9 million of this funding will be used to support commitments Deworm the World has already made, leaving $9.4 million available to support additional work. Of this, we expect that Deworm the World will allocate $7.9 million to its programs in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan and the remainder to its programs in India, which are excluded from this analysis. This projection represents our best guess based on past revenue and our understanding of Deworm the World's funding pipeline. It excludes any funding we may specifically recommend to Deworm the World, beyond our November 2020 recommendation to Open Philanthropy (described below). We include the following sources of funding in our projection:

_Funding currently held by GiveWell to be granted to Deworm the World._ We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.  
_Funding recommended by GiveWell to be granted by Open Philanthropy._14 In November 2020, we recommended that Open Philanthropy grant $4.1 million to Deworm the World to a) support its programs in Kenya and in three states in Nigeria through 2023, and b) conduct scoping work in two potential new countries of operation (Ghana and Indonesia). We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.

_Projected funding due to being a GiveWell top charity._

GiveWell maintains a list of all charities that meet our criteria, along with a recommendation for which charity or charities to give to in order to maximize the impact of additional donations. Some donors give based on our top charity list, but do not follow our recommendation for marginal funding. We estimate the amount that Deworm the World will receive from these donors in the next year and include this amount in our projection of funding available for that year only.15

_Projected funding independent of GiveWell._ We use Deworm the World's annual revenue from the previous year, less the amount we estimate was GiveWell-directed (this includes the funding described above plus funding we specifically recommended to Deworm the World) to estimate the funding that Deworm the World received independent of GiveWell.16 We project that Deworm the World will receive this amount in each of the next three years.

_Projected unrestricted funding._ We do not expect Deworm the World's parent organization, Evidence Action, to allocate unrestricted funding to this program in the next three years. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Available and expected funding."

Spending opportunities

Deworm the World has identified opportunities to spend up to an additional $10.4 million over the next three years in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Evidence Action is not requesting any funding in direct support of its Indian geographies at this time. After applying Deworm the World's available and expected funding, we estimate that Deworm the World could use up to an additional $2.5 million in funding over the next three years. Additional funding would support program costs in Pakistan and in Lagos State, Nigeria in 2023. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Spending opportunities."

## Global need for treatment

There appears to be a substantial unmet need for STH and schistosomiasis treatment globally. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report on 2016 treatments stating that:17

69% of school-age children in need of treatment were treated for STH in 2016, up from 63% in 2015 and 45% in 2014. Coverage was 65% in African countries in 2016.

52% of school-age children in need of treatment were treated for schistosomiasis in 2016, up from 42% in 2015.

We have not vetted this data.

## Evidence Action as an organization

We use qualitative assessments of our top charities to inform our funding recommendations. See this page for more information about this process and for our qualitative assessment of Evidence Action as an organization.
