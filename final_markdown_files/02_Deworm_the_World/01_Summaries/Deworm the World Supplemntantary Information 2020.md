## Description of programs by country

### Section last updated: November 2016

As of September 2016, Deworm the World had supported deworming programs in India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Vietnam, and Nigeria, and it had started support (or was in discussions about starting support) in two other countries (Pakistan and Indonesia).1 Several of these programs started in 2015 or 2016; as of early 2015, Deworm the World had only supported deworming programs in Kenya and India. Each country has or will have a slightly different program model; we expand upon the programs by country below and have summarized some high-level details in this spreadsheet. 

### India

Deworm the World started working in India in 2009.2 It has assisted at both the state level and the national level with all areas mentioned on the main review page.3 Deworm the World has received funding for its work in India from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Dubai Cares, the END Fund, and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation (past).4

In 2014, following advocacy from Deworm the World, the national government decided to implement "National Deworming Day." a single-day school and preschool-based deworming program targeting all at-risk children aged 1-19 for soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) treatment.5 The first National Deworming Day was held in February 2015, with 11 states participating that day and one state postponing until April (five of which received direct support from Deworm the World).6 A second National Deworming Day was held in February 2016 in 30 of India's 36 states and union territories; eight of the participating states received support from Deworm the World.7 India held a third National Deworming Day in August 2016 in 26 states with prevalence rates meriting twice-per-year treatments; Deworm the World supported five of these states.8 Deworm the World is now seeking additional funding to expand its work to several additional states (more on the main review page). One state that Deworm the World previously supported--Delhi--has transitioned to implementing its deworming program with very limited technical support; Deworm the World expects to reduce support to other states as their capacity to operate their programs without Deworm the World's assistance increases over the next few years.9

## Kenya

Deworm the World started to work with the national government in Kenya in 2009, supporting a pilot school-based deworming program.10 In 2010, Deworm the World agreed to support Kenya's National School-Based Deworming Program (NSBDP), which started in 2012 under a 5-year plan funded by CIFF and the END Fund.11 Deworm the World has entered its fifth year of work in Kenya under this agreement (2016-2017) and is seeking funding to continue supporting the Kenya program (more on the main review page).12

Deworm the World provides assistance in all of the other areas we described on the main review page.13 Most of Kenya was mapped before Deworm the World started to work there, and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) is funded by CIFF to conduct independent prevalence surveys (with limited sample sizes) before and after each round of deworming.14 Deworm the World has received funding from the END Fund to support treatments for lymphatic filariasis in Kenya, starting in 2017.15

Similar to in India, the program in Kenya has moved towards a model in which deworming occurs on consolidated Deworming Days.16

Currently, Deworm the World has a robust staff presence in Kenya, in part because Deworm the World implements monitoring activities in Kenya itself (rather than hiring consulting firms to implement this) and acts as the fiscal agent for the program.17 The Kenya team occasionally supports and trains staff for Deworm the World's newer programs.18

## Ethiopia

In Ethiopia, Deworm the World partners with the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)--another of GiveWell's **recommended charities**--to advise the national government.19 Deworm the World started advising Ethiopia in late 2014, after Ethiopian government officials visited Kenya for a learning exchange and spoke with Deworm the World representatives during the trip.20

In early 2015, Ethiopia launched a national school-based deworming program.21 Deworm the World supported the government in implementing a pilot mass drug administration (MDA) in mid-2015 and the national program's first full MDA in late 2015.22 Deworm the World's work on the pilot was funded in part by its unrestricted funding.23 In mid-2015, CIFF and the END Fund decided to fund a five-year national school-based deworming program in Ethiopia.24

Deworm the World has told us that its role in Ethiopia is similar to its role in Kenya and India (though it has less of a staff presence), while SCI assists with activities that are more scientifically technical, such as conducting prevalence surveys.25

## Pakistan

Deworm the World first began to explore the possibility of working in Pakistan in 2015, for two reasons: Pakistan is believed to have a high worm burden across a large population, and there is currently no mass treatment of school-age children for STH in Pakistan.26

An organization that Evidence Action has partnered with on other programs--International Relief & Development (IRD)--works in the health sector in Pakistan.27

In Pakistan, Deworm the World is partnering with two local organizations: IRD and the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives (IDEAS),28 Neither organization has experience with school-based deworming.29 IRD has implemented other health programs and IDEAS is involved in education policy work.30

Because the prevalence of STH in Pakistan has not previously been mapped, IRD and Deworm the World are conducting a nationally representative prevalence survey there.31 The prevalence survey was initially slated to begin in early 2016, but was rescheduled to start in August 2016 after multiple delays; it is expected to finish in November 2016 (see footnote for detail).32 Results of the prevalence survey will determine the recommended treatment strategy for STH in Pakistan. Though WHO has predicted high prevalence of STH throughout most of the country, preliminary results are suggesting that there may be lower prevalence than originally thought, so it is unlikely a nationwide deworming program will be required.33

Deworm the World and its partners have reached out to provincial governments in Pakistan about implementing a deworming program; it expects conversations to move more quickly once results from the prevalence surveys are available.34 In June 2016, the national Ministry of Health in Pakistan dissolved, so Deworm the World expects to primarily work with individual provinces, similar to how it works closely with states in India; it believes that this will cause working in Pakistan to be somewhat more challenging.35

The prevalence survey in Pakistan is almost entirely supported by Deworm the World's unrestricted funding.36

## Nigeria

In 2015, Deworm the World hired a consulting firm to assess the opportunities for working in Nigeria.37 The assessment found that several states with a high burden of STH did not have any NGO partners focused on deworming.38 After meeting with government officials in four of the states, Deworm the World decided to work in Cross River.39

In Nigeria, the national government requests that all programs that target a neglected tropical disease (NTD) be integrated with other NTD programs.40 Deworm the World partners with RTI International in Cross River.41 Deworm the World is supporting the state government to implement school-based treatment for schistosomiasis and STH, while RTI focuses on community-based treatment of other endemic NTDs (more details in footnote).42 The first MDA they supported took place in June 2016.43

Most of Nigeria has already been mapped for STH and schistosomiasis, which means that Deworm the World does not need to assist with mapping surveys.44 Future activities in Nigeria will likely include advocacy and technical assistance to the national government and expanding Deworm the World's support to additional states.45 Deworm the World intends to register in Nigeria and establish a national office there to support its future scale-up.46

Deworm the World is funding its work in Nigeria with unrestricted funding.47

## Vietnam

Deworm the World is partnering with the Thrive Networks in Vietnam on an integrated deworming, sanitation, and hygiene education program in four provinces.48 The program is funded primarily by Dubai Cares and includes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the impact of hygiene education on STH reinfection rates.49 The program was approved by the Vietnamese government in late 2015.50

Some deworming already occurs in Vietnam; Deworm the World and Thrive Networks are partnering with the government to improve the existing deworming program in the four provinces targeted by the program.51 Deworm the World hopes to convince the national government to develop an evidence-based, cost-effective national deworming program.52

The first MDA supported by Deworm the World occurred in April 2016; it was conducted by the National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE)--the government agency in Vietnam that implements MDAs.53

After the MDA occurred, Deworm the World received the results from the baseline prevalence survey it conducted pre-MDA; the results indicated that the treatment frequency required for each province was lower than expected.54 Deworm the World is currently advocating for the government to adjust its strategy; the current government policy is to conduct biannual deworming MDAs.55

Deworm the World has also worked with NIMPE to conduct prevalence surveys in an additional 21 provinces.56 This was beyond the scope of the Dubai Cares grant, so Deworm the World supported the prevalence surveys with its unrestricted funding.57 The results from that survey indicated that most provinces only need treatment once per year or once every other year.58

Deworm the World originally became involved in Vietnam through discussions between its former Executive Director, Alix Zwane, and Thrive Networks' former regional director.59 We are unsure who initiated the partnership between the two organizations.

## Nepal

In early 2015, Deworm the World was in discussions with Nepal about starting a deworming program there.60 However, in mid-2015 Nepal experienced a large earthquake and those discussions were halted.61 It has not yet re-engaged with those conversations, in part due to capacity constraints.62

Deworm the World was first connected to the government of Nepal via the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) (similar to how the program in Bihar began).63

### Indonesia

Deworm the World has had initial conversations with the government of Indonesia about a potential deworming program there.64 Indonesia would require both technical assistance and funding for the implementation of a deworming program.65 Deworm the World hopes to make progress on conversations during the last quarter of 2016.66

### Lymphatic filariasis (LF) programs in the countries where Deworm the World works

#### Section last updated: November 2017

Rajasthan, India. Rajasthan is not endemic for LF so there is no LF treatment program there.67

#### Other states in India. There are active lymphatic filariasis (LF) programs in several of the states that Deworm the World supports.68 We discuss some details of India's LF program in this footnote.69 Deworm the World notes, "We do not believe that the reported LF treatments in India are accurate. We conducted some limited process monitoring and coverage validation for LF in certain states, and found that actual compliance appears much lower in some places (ranging from 22% in UP to 43% in MP and 67% in Telangana). "70

**Kenya. ** There are LF programs in six coastal-region counties in Kenya, which are treated in a program that is supported by Deworm the World. "n

**Ethiopia. ** Ethiopia has had an active LF program. Going forward it intends to coordinate LF treatments with treatments for STH to avoid duplication of efforts.72

**Nigeria. ** In Cross River, Deworm the World works with its partner RTI to support an integrated NTD program. Our understanding is that there is coordination to avoid duplication of efforts for LF and STH.73

**Vietnam. ** Vietnam recently stopped its LF program and intends to monitor whether or not it has successfully eliminated LF in the future.74

**Pakistan. ** Deworm the World staff told us that according to WHO, Pakistan is not endemic for LF.75

## Changes in prevalence over time

_Section last updated: November 2016, except where_  
_otherwise noted_

## India prevalence surveys

Deworm the World has conducted prevalence surveys in several of the states that it assists with in India, and has conducted one follow-up prevalence survey in the state of Bihar.76 The two surveys measuring the prevalence of worm infections in Bihar are consistent with the notion that the deworming program reduced infection rates in target populations. However, there are also plausible, alternative explanations for these results. (Note that the first survey was not designed to measure a subsequent change in infection rates, so our conclusion is not surprising.) The original prevalence study in Bihar measured prevalence in four of Bihar's 38 districts, which were selected to inform a prevalence model based on climatic and socioeconomic variance across the state.77 We are not sure how representative that survey was of the state as a whole since the districts were not chosen randomly.78 Since the survey found >50% prevalence,79 the government of Bihar planned to follow WHO's recommendation to conduct deworming MDAs twice per year, with one round each year led by the National Filaria Control Program (NFCP) and one round through schools that would be assisted by Deworm the World.80 However, according to Deworm the World, only four rounds of deworming took place between the two prevalence surveys in 2011 and early 2015, with one community-based round led by the NFCP and three school-based rounds assisted by Deworm the World.81

Deworm the World's follow-up survey in early 2015 was conducted in randomly selected districts and was designed to be representative of the entire state and the three climatic regions.82 The results of both surveys, broken down by climatic region, are in the table below; no single district was surveyed in both prevalence surveys.

\end{tabular}

We are unsure whether worm prevalence in Bihar would have increased or decreased in the four years between the two prevalence surveys if the three MDAs that Deworm the World supported had not occurred.84 Here we've listed some other factors that we weigh when considering these results:

**Methodological limitations of these prevalence surveys. ** It may be that the original prevalence survey took place in districts with unusually high worm prevalence. Since it is unclear whether the original prevalence survey was representative of the state or its climatic zones and the two prevalence surveys did not sample the same districts, it may be that the decrease in prevalence seen above is the result of comparing different populations rather than a fall in prevalence in the same population over time. 

**MDAs for lymphatic filariasis. ** The NFCP, which is designed to reduce the burden of LF as well as STH, claims it conducted MDAs in Bihar in 2012 and 2014 with albendazole, the drug used to treat STH.85 According to the Indian government's program website, the LF treatment program is designed to be annual, and reached 86% of the population in both 2012 and 2014.86 We would not be surprised if the coverage rates reported by the LF program were inaccurate, but we have not tried to verify them. Deworm the World has said that the 2014 round actually occurred in early 2015 after the 2015 prevalence survey.87 

Factors other than MDAs. There are a variety of large-scale changes that could affect worm prevalence, such as improved sanitation infrastructure or general development. According to India's central bank, inflation-adjusted per-capita income in Bihar increased by a total of 39% over a similar four year period, suggesting that there could have been broad improvements in the region that would be associated with better health and lower worm prevalence.88 Alternatively, it seems possible that population growth combined with poor sanitation infrastructure could have increased worm prevalence over this period if Deworm the World-supported MDAs had not been carried out.

## Kenya prevalence surveys

_Sub-section last updated: November 2017_

In Kenya, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) is funded by CIFF to conduct independent prevalence surveys before and after every MDA that Deworm the World supports; Deworm the World is not involved in these surveys.89

We have seen results from the prevalence surveys conducted before and after the Year 1 (2012-13), Year 2 (2013-14), Year 3 (2014-15), and Year 4 (2015-16) MDAs in Kenya.90 Deworm the World has provided us with details of a) how the baseline survey was conducted and b) pre-registered plans for follow up surveys.91 The plan for the surveys was to visit the same 60 schools each year and visit additional schools in years 1, 3 and 5.92 Note that we have not yet seen detailed descriptions of the methodologies used for the Year 2, Year 3, or Year 4 surveys, so we have not verified that they were carried out as intended.93 Further note that in Year 4 only 48 of 60 schools were surveyed post-MDA due to last-minute changes in the treatment schedule in three counties.94 The year 4 pre- and post-MDA prevalence data is therefore drawn from 48 schools only, which may have introduced bias into the results.95 The prevalence surveys are close to representative but not fully representative of the program Deworm the World supports: they are conducted in 20 districts randomly sampled from 66 districts in which STH was assumed to be endemic before Kenya started its national deworming program; we do not believe the 66 districts were selected randomly from all districts in the national program, though our understanding is that any bias is likely to be small.96 We summarize the key features of the prevalence surveys in this footnote.97 We believe these surveys provide evidence that the deworming program reduced infection rates in target populations, indicating that the program effectively reached targeted children. The tables below show the results of the prevalence surveys for Year 1 (2012-13), Year 2 (2013-14), Year 3 (2014-15), and Year 4 (2015-16).

## Kenya prevalence survey results - soil-transmitted helminths

\end{tabular}

Schools in Kenya do not all undergo MDAs simultaneously, but the surveys are conducted at approximately the same time before and after each MDA; the post-MDA surveys are conducted approximately 5-6 weeks after an MDA.106 Additionally, it seems possible that surveying the same 60 schools each year could introduce bias: if the schools have an incentive to show that the program is working, they may execute a higher-quality deworming program than they otherwise would if they weren't going to be re-surveyed.107 There is no control group for the prevalence surveys.

### Does Deworm the World increase the likelihood that governments implement deworming programs?

#### Section last updated: November 2016

While we have limited evidence to rely on, we would guess that Deworm the World increases the likelihood that (national and subnational) governments implement deworming programs. In India, state governments seem to heavily utilize Deworm the World when planning, implementing, and monitoring their deworming programs. In several present and future countries, Deworm the World pays (or expects it may pay) the majority of financial program costs, which increases our expectation that the organization is critical to the program happening.108

Below, we look in detail at what we know of Deworm the World's impact in India, as a light case study of Deworm the World's potential impact. We detail what we know with respect to Deworm the World's experience in India, including:

1. Our limited understanding of how Indian states have historically decided to launch and maintain health programs with NGO assistance;

2. Deworm the World's role in the mass school-based deworming programs that were in operation in India before the first national deworming day (NDD) in 2015, including our conversations with government officials in Rajasthan about their decision to launch a deworming program with Deworm the World's assistance;

3. The national government's interaction with Deworm the World as part of its decision to launch a national deworming day in India in 2015. We then present what we know of Deworm the World's impact in several other countries, where our knowledge is more limited.

## Reasons new health programs may be started or halted in India

Deworm the World and Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) have told us that Indian state governments often receive funds earmarked for broader health programs but often fail to spend these funds.109 We asked the **Center for Global Development (CGD)** for a recommendation of someone to talk to in order to understand states' decisions to initiate deworming programs, and CGD referred us to Professor Devesh Kapur.100 Dr. Kapur asserted that it takes significant internal political will or external stimulus (such as from a non-profit) to sufficiently overcome general bureaucratic inertia in India to sustain a new health program. This holds true even in cases where a national mandate exists for a program (as it does for school-based deworming). Dr. Kapur felt that in the majority of cases, nonprofit technical assistance was likely to increase the probability of a program's going forward.11

Deworm the World told us that it believes that some school health programs have been stalled in Indian states due to negative media attention;12 one of Deworm the World's goals is to prevent these reports in the states in which it works.13 The documentation that Deworm the World has sent us supports--but does not fully demonstrate--the possibility that negative media undermined consistent mass deworming in Assam before the National Deworming Day in 2015. We have not attempted to independently verify that possibility because we do not think we would likely be able to do so effectively. Nonetheless, it is plausible that were decision-makers in Indian states to have the impression that negative reports could cause a program to be halted, they might be less willing to move ahead, and Deworm the World's assurances that it would help prevent these reports could increase the likelihood that a state agrees to implement deworming.

## Early deworming programs in India and Deworm the World's role

In 2013 Deworm the World and CIFF told us that the Indian government mandates that all states provide school-based deworming through the larger school-based Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation program and that states can request funding for deworming through this program.14 At the end of 2013, the only states in India that appear to have been implementing school-based deworming programs were Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Jharkhand, Punjab, Rajasthan, and possibly Assam.18 Deworm the World states that it (or others affiliated with it) played a key role in four of these seven states' decisions to implement deworming.18 In late 2014, Deworm the World believed that more states were starting to launch their own deworming programs without assistance from Deworm the World but was unsure how many had successfully done so.17

Without involvement from Deworm the World, Assam initiated a vitamin A supplementation and deworming mass drug administration (MDA) in the 2010-2011 school year but reported low and conflicting coverage for that year.18 In the 2012-2013 school year Assam planned to implement a deworming program through the School Health Program, though we are not sure whether that program happened as planned.19 Assam did approach Deworm the World in late 2013 to explore opportunities for the organization to provide assistance to the state, though as of late 2016 Deworm the World has not become directly involved there.120

During our site visit to Deworm the World in Rajasthan, India, we spoke with three government officials who were involved in the deworming program.121 Of these, two stressed the importance of Deworm the World's technical assistance, and the person we perceive as having been most responsible (of the three) for the decision to go forward with deworming gave the impression that the availability of this technical assistance had been a key factor in deciding to go forward. It should be noted that one of the three gave the impression that Deworm the World's help was not needed, and all three conversations took place with multiple Deworm the World representatives present. With that said, the highest ranking of the three officials gave what we felt to be a nuanced and realistic picture of Deworm the World's impact that implied a substantial (while not determinative) role. She stated that a) the immediate availability of technical assistance improved her confidence that the program would proceed quickly and smoothly, b) she wasn't sure whether the program would have proceeded if not for Deworm the World, and c) she was interested in finding a nonprofit technical assistance partner for at least one other program in a different category.22 This suggests that nonprofit technical assistance can be a key factor in progressing a program.

## The National Deworming Day and Deworm the World's role

In 2014, Deworm the World told us that the Indian national government was pursuing the idea of having a coordinated national deworming day (NDD), whereby the national government would provide some assistance to states in implementing school-based deworming on a single day to encourage more states to implement the program. Deworm the World told us that it initially proposed this idea.123 Deworm the World said that the government asked it to provide technical assistance to the NDD, including helping develop the implementation strategy, designing and developing training and reference materials, community mobilization strategies, and monitoring and evaluation systems and reporting formats.124 The posters, ads for radio and television, training materials, and other documents that Deworm the World helped create for NDD are available at the website in this footnote.125

Deworm the World told us that, as part of its advisory role in the planning process, it advocated for a delay of the initial program from October 2014 to February 2015 because it believed there weren't sufficient drug supplies.126 The first NDD occurred in February 2015,127 with 12 states participating (with deworming in one additional state occurring in April).128 A second NDD occurred in February 2016, with 30 of India's 36 states and union territories participating,129

## Deworm the World's impact on the existence of deworming programs in other countries

In October 2016, we spoke to Deworm the World about whether or not deworming programs would have occurred in some of the other countries it works in without Deworm the World's assistance. Of the three countries we discussed, only one (Nigeria) seemed like a case for Deworm the World causing new deworming programs to exist:130

**Vietnam**: There was a national deworming program in Vietnam before Deworm the World started working there, although our impression is that this program did not treat all areas that needed a deworming MDA or treated those areas somewhat sporadically. Deworm the World told us that the RCT it is supporting in Vietnam likely would not have been funded if Deworm the World were not involved.131

**Nigeria**: Deworm the World believes that if it had not partnered with RTI in Cross River, Nigeria, RTI most likely would have supported community-based treatments specifically targeting onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis in the state; in those local government areas (LGAs) also endemic for schistosomiasis and/or STH, treatment for those would likely have been provided.132 Such a program would not have treated the LGAs in Cross River that are not endemic for LF and/or onchocerciasis but _are_ endemic for schistosomiasis and/or STH. There are many funders supporting NTD treatments in Nigeria, and Deworm the World noted that another organization may have supported deworming in Cross River if RTI and Deworm the World had not started to work there. However, many funders are focused on _integrated_ NTD programs, which often prioritize LF and onchocerciasis treatments, so Deworm the World is not sure if other organizations would have ensured that all appropriate LGAs were treated for schistosomiasis and STH.133 Furthermore, there are still funding gaps in Nigeria,134 so it is possible that if another funder had supported Cross River, this would have come at the expense of not covering another state.

**Ethiopia**: Ethiopia was already receiving support from SCI before Deworm the World started assisting the national government. SCI and the government were planning a national program;135 this program would have likely occurred without Deworm the World's support. We discuss how Deworm the World may have influenced the _quality_ of these programs below.

### Does Deworm the World's work increase the quality of deworming programs?

#### Section last updated: November 2016

Our intuition is that Deworm the World's activities increase the quality of the programs it supports, but we are highly uncertain about this. Deworm the World may improve program quality by:

Increasing the chances that the first deworming round in each state begins earlier than it otherwise would have and that subsequent rounds occur on schedule.136 Providing training or increasing the training quality by simplifying training material and creating a more robust training program for those who train representatives from each school.137 Ensuring that support roles are staffed.138

Improving focus and attention to detail, possibly increasing the likelihood that schools receive the materials and instructions necessary to implement the deworming program.139

Expanding the scope of the program to a broader age group.140

Increasing community acceptance of mass treatment and the ability of a program to avoid or withstand publicity associated with related or seemingly-related adverse events.141

Implementing or advocating for monitoring systems. This may improve program quality by creating a mechanism through which implementers are held accountable. Also, monitoring systems could generate lessons that Deworm the World and the government could use in future rounds of treatment.142

Advocating for treatment strategies that align with WHO guidelines, which may help to ensure that children are receiving the necessary dosage of drugs on an annual basis.143

Again, to answer this question we have primarily looked at evidence from Deworm the World's program in India. Evidence that relates to Deworm the World's impact on the quality of deworming programs includes the following, each discussed in more detail below:

Testimony of a government official in Rajasthan in 2013

Calls Deworm the World monitors made in India during the run-up to Deworming Day

A training we observed in 2013

We also note what we have learned from talking to Deworm the World about its programs in other countries.

## Testimony of a government official

We believe our strongest piece of evidence in favor of the idea that Deworm the World improves quality is the conversation we had with a Rajasthan nodal officer in 2013,144 who cited many of the points above and made the case that Deworm the World had played an important role in improving the quality of deworming, backing up an intuition that, without external support, such programs would often be of lower quality. On the other hand, (a) this conversation took place with multiple Deworm the World representatives present, and the nodal officer had worked closely with Deworm the World; (b) another government official (on the same visit) stated that he believed Deworm the World's technical help was not needed and did not add value, as the state was accustomed to running school health programs and deworming is a relatively simple one (we do not put strong weight on (b) alone, since the government official may have had other incentives to give the message he did and had not worked as closely with the program as the nodal officer, but in context of the other observations we find (b) worth noting).

## Monitoring calls before Deworming Day

As part of its standard monitoring process in India, Deworm the World has tele-callers place thousands of calls to government employees at different levels of government during the run-up to Deworming Day to ensure that preparations are proceeding as intended.145 Deworm the World reports that these calls helped to uncover problems, which were reported on the same day to the appropriate government officials to address.146

It also seems plausible that these calls reduce the likelihood that problems arise after the calls are placed, due to the signal of importance created by the call itself. We are unaware of how common these monitoring calls are as part of other government programs, nor are we aware of any data that could help quantify the size of the impact they have.

## Training observed in 2013

We felt that the training we attended in 2013 (the only part of Deworm the World's work that we observed directly) had major limitations in terms of potential to improve program quality.147 Deworm the World has made changes to address these since this visit, though we have not observed a training since that time.148

### Deworm the World's impact on program quality in other countries

In October 2016, we spoke to Deworm the World about how it has impacted the quality of programs that it has supported. In general, Deworm the World claims to have improved the quality of the programs it has worked with:149

**Vietnam**: In Vietnam, Deworm the World works with the National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE), which had conducted prevalence surveys and MDAs prior to Deworm the World's support. Deworm the World feels that collaboration with NIMPE in the four provinces Deworm the World is supporting has improved NIMPE's processes, although Deworm the World is unsure if NIMPE will adopt its practices more broadly. For example, prior to Deworm the World's support, NIMPE's prevalence surveys only examined a small number of schools in limited areas that were not fully representative of the area being surveyed.150 Additionally, NIMPE did not have procedures in place to train teachers and health workers on how to implement a Deworming Day; Deworm the World assisted with setting up these processes. Deworm the World has also been advocating for Vietnam to follow WHO guidelines when designing its treatment strategy; it hopes that this will make the program more evidence-based in the future.

**Nigeria**: In Nigeria, Deworm the World provided expertise on school-based MDA programs. Without its assistance, Deworm the World believes that its partner, RTI, may have started a program in Cross River that only supported community-based programs, which would have missed school-age children in areas where community-based programs were not recommended.

**Ethiopia**: Because it works closely with SCI in Ethiopia, Deworm the World believes that it is difficult to assess the impacts attributable to Deworm the World alone. SCI was providing technical assistance to Ethiopia before Deworm the World began to, and Deworm the World believes that SCI was planning to support the treatments of both schistosomiasis and STH prior to Deworm the World's involvement. Deworm the World noted that it leveraged its Kenya team's expertise to assist the Ethiopian government and to facilitate learning exchanges between the two countries.

## Accuracy of coverage data

_Section last updated: November 2016_

In calculating the cost-per-treatment figures above, we use the number of children treated in the programs, which is obtained from data reported by governments to Deworm the World. We have made adjustments to these figures in our cost-per-treatment analysis based on findings from Deworm the World's independent monitoring of treatment numbers in a sample of schools.

### Comparing classroom data to school data

Monitors visit a random sample of schools to compare each school's records of how many children it dewormed to the number of children that were dewormed according to its classroom records. Based on this data, it appears that many schools in 2015 did not follow the recording protocol, but the schools that did had reasonable agreement on the number of children dewormed between the classroom records and the school-wide records (details in this footnote).151

In 2016, the ratio of students recorded as dewormed in schools' records to the students the school reported as dewormed ranged from 53% to 94% (53% means that for every 100 students reported being dewormed, only 53 were actually recorded as dewormed when Deworm the World monitors checked schools' forms).152

### Comparing classroom data to state data

It is our understanding that Deworm the World does not regularly monitor the accuracy of the aggregation process beyond the school level for each round of deworming, although it periodically checks this.153 The number of children treated in each school is recorded in classrooms and then aggregated and reported by school staff to government officials. Our understanding is that data is generally aggregated stepwise by officials at several levels (school, node, block, district, and state) to create a reported coverage estimate for the entire state.154 Errors in the aggregation process could occur if those performing the aggregation have an incentive to overreport the number of children dewormed, or if reporting forms are lost (in which case we believe that deworming would be underreported).155

We calculated the portion of children that were dewormed --according to class records in schools which used class records or didn't do deworming--at the schools monitors visited. Then, we compared this to the fraction of total students covered out of total students enrolled in government schools (details of methodology in this footnote).156

The results of estimating statewide coverage using both government-reported data and monitors' data are in the below table.

## Estimates of total statewide coverage (India, 2015)157

While we don't put much weight in the comparison above, we note that a) there are cases in which the proportion of children covered is significantly different, which makes us more uncertain how much weight to put in the coverage figures, and b) the fact that we do not see a pattern of the government consistently over-reporting its coverage figures gives us slightly more confidence in using the coverage figures.

## Kenya

We have not looked in-depth at the data that Deworm the World has sent us related to coverage in Kenya. If we take the coverage reporting figures at face value, Kenya was able to treat 83% of its target population of children (in counties participating in the national deworming program).158 According to one recent summary monitoring report from Kenya that we have seen, monitors observed coverage to be 99% in the schools they visited (based on school records).159

As in India, Deworm the World's Kenya team also calculates the ratio of students recorded as being dewormed in classroom records to the students reported as dewormed by the school. In the 2014-15 round (Year 3, the most recent round for which we have data), Deworm the World found that this ratio was 105%, implying that the government had underreported coverage for that round.160

# Are donations to Deworm the World leveraged?

###### Abstract

We have written before about the complexity involved in trying to understand **leverage in charity**, and below we lay out the relevant issues worth considering in the case of Deworm the World. Donors to Deworm the World support only expenses paid by Deworm the World. Generally, Deworm the World tries to work with governments and other funders to create funding arrangements where each partner is contributing some portion of the program's costs. Sometimes, governments pay most of the expenses. For example, Deworm the World's costs in India are only approximately 44% of the overall cost of the program (not including the value of teacher time).161

The role that Deworm the World's funds play in the program is an important consideration in determining the cost-effectiveness of donations. This role could range between:

With leverage, high cost-effectiveness. Deworm the World's funds could have high leverage by: (a) causing government funds that otherwise would not have been spent or would have been spent on a lower-value program to be used in support of a deworming program; or (b) contributing a relatively small amount of funding to cause a deworming program to run significantly better, thereby reaching many more children than it otherwise would have.

No leverage, average cost-effectiveness. Deworm the World's funding may allow the program to reach more children at a similar overall cost-per-treatment as it would have otherwise.

Minimal contributions, low cost-effectiveness. If Deworm the World's work leads to few additional children receiving treatment, it may increase the overall cost-per-treatment. In the past, we guessed that Deworm the World's work in India played a role in increasing the likelihood that state governments conduct deworming programs, so we estimated that its leverage on funds used for scaling up India programs could have reasonably ranged from less than 1x (i.e., programs would have taken place without Deworm the World's involvement) to 4-5x, though we were highly uncertain about this estimate.162 India may have been an especially promising place to achieve leverage because the Indian national government had made money available for state governments interested in implementing deworming, and states may have been more likely to implement deworming with the addition of technical assistance.163

In the countries Deworm the World is starting to work in, governments may have less funding to support deworming. This may cause Deworm the World to pay a higher fraction of the overall cost of the program, making the upside potential for leverage of future donations more limited. For example, we estimate that Deworm the World bears the majority of total program costs in Kenya.164 Deworm the World has told us that it expects the cost per treatment of its future programs to be more similar to its program in Kenya than India, though we have not explicitly asked about whether it expects to pay a similar share of overall program costs as it does in its Kenya program.165

## Devorm the World Initiative and Evidence Action

_Section last updated: November 2016_

Deworm the World Initiative is led by Evidence Action. Evidence Action supports other programs in addition to Deworm the World.166

This has some implications relevant to Deworm the World's room for more funding: donations to Evidence Action, even if restricted to Deworm the World, might change the actions that staff take to fundraise (i.e., which grants they pursue, what type of funding they ask for). We've seen some evidence that this is the case:

In early 2015, Evidence Action's plan for using unrestricted funds included a relatively high priority to spend $0.8 million on Deworm the World.

After receiving funds related to GiveWell's recommendation that were designated for Deworm the World, Evidence Action allocated unrestricted funding to other programs instead of to Deworm the World. As such, it seems likely that $0.8 million of GiveWell directed funds (70% of GiveWell-directed funds to Deworm the World that year) caused on the margin more funding to Evidence Action's other programs, rather than more dewormings to take place.167

In early 2016, Evidence Action's plans for the first $1.55 million in unrestricted funding it raised included spending $100,000 in unrestricted funding on Deworm the World, $600,000 on Dispensers for Safe Water, $300,000 on Evidence Action Beta, and the rest on organizational development.168 The next $1.5 million raised after the first $1.55 million was expected to go towards reserves.169 We are not sure how this compares to Evidence Action's plans before the 2015 giving season, which were not shared with us. We note that Deworm the World was slated to receive significantly less than Dispensers for Safe Water, despite being a similarly sized program. It seems plausible to us that had Deworm the World not received so much unrestricted funding from GiveWell-influenced donors over the 2015 giving season, Evidence Action would have planned to allocate more of its expected unrestricted funding to Deworm the World. In late 2016, Evidence Action shared with us a rough estimate of how it planned to allocate (or already had allocated) $1.9 million in unrestricted funding in 2016.170

For the $1.9 million, $163,000 (8%) was expected to go to Deworm the World, which is slightly more than the portion expected in early 2016.171 However, no funding was allocated to Evidence Action Beta.172 While we are not sure why this is the case, it is possible that Evidence Action chose to use its funding on other programs after Good Ventures made a grant to Evidence Action Beta in early 2016.173 Evidence Action also planned to allocate significantly more than expected to Dispensers for Safe Water ($1 million, compared to $0.6 million originally planned).774 The reallocation of Evidence Action Beta funding, which served primarily to increase funding to Dispensers for Safe Water, again indicates that GiveWell-influenced funding may be impacting how Evidence Action chooses to use its unrestricted funding. Evidence Action also shared with us a rough estimate of how it would allocate $1.8 million in unrestricted funding that it expects to have in 2017: $600,000 is expected to be allocated to Deworm the World while $500,000 is expected to go to Dispensers for Safe Water and $100,00 to Evidence Action Beta (the rest is for organizational development).775

Deworm the World also notes that many of Evidence Action's investments in general organizational development have benefited Deworm the World, as well as Evidence Action's other programs, substantially.776
