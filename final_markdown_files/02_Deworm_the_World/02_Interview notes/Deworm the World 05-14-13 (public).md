## Topics Covered

* GiveWell explained our relationship with our recommended charities, as well as the process for becoming a recommended charity.
* Deworm the World asked for a better understanding of GiveWell's position on deworming as an intervention. GiveWell explained that we believe that deworming is an outstanding opportunity for donors to improve peoples' lives with additional funding.
* Deworm the World brought up that one challenge might be attributing impact of less-direct intervention aspects, such as working with local governments to improve deworming programs.
* Deworm the World stated that Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), which has historically housed Deworm the World, has created a new organization called Evidence Action to house Deworm the World and Dispensers for Safe Water.
* Deworm the World and GiveWell are planning to set up a follow up conversation to get a better understanding of what Deworm the World does, and how GiveWell would evaluate it.
