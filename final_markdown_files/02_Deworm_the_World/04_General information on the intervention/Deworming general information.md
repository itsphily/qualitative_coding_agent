Combination Deworming (Mass Drug Administration Targeting Both Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminths)

_Published: December 2013; Last updated: January 2018_

In a nutshell

This page discusses the general case for mass deworming. We focus our discussion on work similar to that of deworming programs implemented by several of our top charities. Mass deworming involves treating large numbers of people with parasite-killing drugs: praziquantel kills the parasites that cause schistosomiasis, while albendazole kills soil-transmitted helminths. Treatment is cheaper than diagnosis and usually takes place in areas where worms are fairly common. Also, side effects of the drugs are believed to be minor; thus, everyone in a given population (sometimes schoolchildren; sometimes the community at large) is treated, without being individually tested for the presence of infections. Mass deworming is generally very inexpensive on a per-person-treated basis (in the range of $0.50). The benefits are potentially major, but also debatable: parasitic infections rarely cause mortality or other acute effects, and the evidence on their impact on quality of life is thin. In brief:

There is strong evidence that administration of the drugs reduces worm loads, but weaker evidence on the causal relationship between reducing worm loads and improved life outcomes. Evidence for the impact of deworming on short-term general health is thin. We would guess that deworming has small impacts on weight, but the evidence for its impact on other health outcomes is weak. A series of follow-ups to one experiment (**Miguel and Kremer 2004**) finds that reducing worm infection loads during childhood can have a significant later impact on income. We find these studies to constitute evidence that is suggestive, though not conclusive or necessarily representative (the intensity of worm infections in this study was substantially heavier than the intensity of worm infections in most contexts where deworming is carried out today). We provide a deeper overview of the evidence for long-term effects of deworming below and at two blog posts: **here** and **here**. Attempts to estimate the cost-effectiveness of deworming within the **disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) framework** have been problematic. In 2011, GiveWell found the figures published by the World Health Organization to be **off by ~100x due to errors** and **flawed in other ways even once corrected**. Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, but our best guess is that deworming is comparably cost-effective to our **priority programs** (more).

# What are the infections targeted by mass deworming, i.e., soil-transmitted helminithiasis (STH) and schistosomiasis? Schistosomiasis

Schistosomiasis involves infection with parasites released by snails and transmitted through the skin when it is exposed to infested water.1 The most common species of schistosoma infections in humans are _S. mansoni, S. haematobium,_ and _S. japonicum.2_

While _S. japonicum_ is present primarily in Asia and the Pacific, _S. mansoni_ and _S. haematobium_ are found in much of the tropics, including Sub-Saharan Africa.3 There is disagreement about how common schistosomiasis infections are; estimates range from 200 million to more than 600 million people infected.4 The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative treats schistosomiasis and STH while the Deworm the World Initiative mainly treats STH. Since the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative works mainly in Africa, we focus here on the morbidity caused by those species present in Africa, _S. mansoni_ and _S. haematobium_. _S. japonicum_ is believed by some scholars to be more dangerous than the other strains that cause schistosomiasis.5

The pathology of schistosomiasis varies by species and infection intensity. _S. mansoni_ tends to infect the intestines, liver, and spleen,6 while _S. haematobium_ typically infects blood vessels near the bladder.7

The burden of infections is typically highest in children and young adults and gradually declines as people age (even without treatment).8

In general, the morbidity caused by schistosomiasis arises from the eggs that the parasite lays while it inhabits the human host.9 Symptoms can include:

Hematuria (blood in the urine) or dysuria (painful urination);10 anemia and other nutritional deficiencies.11 Because these symptoms can have many causes, particularly in very poor populations (where schistosomiasis tends to be most prevalent), it is difficult to pinpoint the extent to which schistosomiasis contributes to them; the best information we have on this question comes from studies of deworming, which we discuss **below**. Urinary tract infections and other bladder problems at late stages of the disease, potentially leading to bladder cancer and kidney failure;12 blood diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal pain, and liver failure;13 death.14 As discussed **below**, death due to schistosomiasis is quite rare; we have no good quantification of the contribution of schistosomiasis to non-fatal problems along these lines. Developmental effects. There is some evidence that schistosomiasis and/or STH impair development and can lower quality of life over the long term. We discuss this further **below**. Some, but not all, symptoms of schistosomiasis are reversible with treatment.15

## Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH)

Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) includes trichuriais (or whipworm infection), hookworm infection, and asceriasis (or roundworm infection). Each is estimated to affect the following number of people worldwide:16

Trichuriais: 604-795 million people

Hookworm: 576-740 million people

Asceriasis: 807-1,121 million people

The asceriasis and trichuriais worms feed on the contents of the intestines, while hookworms feed on host blood in the small intestine, moving frequently and leaving small bleeding sores behind.17

People can be, and often are, infected by multiple worms (and multiple species of worms) at once.18

The prevailing understanding of soil-transmitted helminths is that many cases are asymptomatic and that morbidity depends on the intensity of infection.19 Symptoms can include:

Anemia and other nutritional deficiencies.20 Because these symptoms can have many causes, particularly in very poor populations (where STHs tend to be most prevalent), it is difficult to pinpoint the extent to which STHs contribute to them; the best information we have on this question comes from studies of deworming, which we discuss below. Intestinal obstruction,21 inflammation of the colon,22 and death.23 As discussed below, the non-fatal effects are generally rare and brief in duration. Developmental effects. There is some evidence that schistosomiasis and/or STH impair development and can lower quality of life over the long term. We discuss this further below.

## How does mass deworming work?

Mass deworming is intended for areas with fairly high prevalence of the infections discussed here; people are treated without being individually tested. For STH, the World Health Organization recommends treatment with albendazole or mebendazole, with frequency of administration varying with prevalence of infection.24

For schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization recommends treating schoolaged children and other at-risk populations with praziquantel, with frequency of administration varying with prevalence of infection.25

Distributions target preschool-age children, school-age children, or the population at large.26 The Disease Control Priorities Report states that schools provide a strong infrastructure and that teachers can be trained to deliver drugs safely.27

A fuller picture of the process can be gained from our notes on our visit to a stakeholders meeting for a national deworming program and a demonstration deworming, as guests of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative.

## Does mass deworming have a strong track record?

Strong evidence suggests that mass deworming reduces the prevalence of the infections discussed here. There are two Cochrane reviews of randomized control trials of mass drug treatments for schistosomiasis (primarily using praziquantel, though occasionally metrifonate or oxamniquine). They both conclude that praziquantel is effective in treating schistosomiasis.28

A 2000 meta-analysis found that mass treatment with albendazole was effective in decreasing the prevalence of all three soil-transmitted helminths, though more so for asceriasis than hookworm or trichuriais.29

## What are the benefits of mass deworming?

Below, we discuss three major potential consequences of schistosomiasis/STH infections:

# Impacts on general health

Evidence for the impact of deworming on short-term general health is thin. We would guess that deworming has small impacts on weight, but the evidence for its impact on other health outcomes is weak. **Severe symptoms** such as intestinal obstruction and major organ damage. These occur in only a very small proportion of those infected, so they do not play a significant role in our analysis of the benefits of deworming. **Developmental effects**. There is some evidence that schistosomiasis and/or STH impair development and can lower quality of life over the long term. These potential effects are the primary benefits that we estimate from deworming interventions. We address each of these separately below, and then discuss other possible effects about which less is known.

## Impacts on general health

In this section, we first discuss the effect of deworming on weight and haemoglobin levels (low haemoglobin indicates anemia).30 These are the two health outcomes for which we have done the most analysis. We then discuss the evidence we have seen on other immediate impacts of deworming; this evidence is very limited.

### Weight

Our best guess is that deworming likely had small impacts on weight in the contexts in which it was previously studied. Three separate, recent systematic reviews have assessed the effect of deworming on weight. GiveWell Senior Advisor David Roodman summarizes the estimates from these reviews in this blog post and concludes, "The three reviews are best seen as converging to a central impact estimate of about 0.1 kg of weight gain." See the blog post for more detail.

### Haemoglobin levels

The estimated effects of deworming on haemoglobin levels can vary significantly by context and by one's approach to selecting and combining studies. Our best guess is that any effects of deworming on haemoglobin levels are likely to be small. We previously conducted a detailed review of literature reviews and studies discussing the impact of deworming on changes in haemoglobin levels and concluded that treating children pre-screened for schistosomiasis and combination (STH and schistosomiasis) deworming appeared to increase haemoglobin levels, while it was unclear whether STH-only deworming increased haemoglobin levels.31

However, two recent updates to Cochrane meta-analyses appear to be more negative than previous versions of the meta-analyses that we relied on in previous versions of our deworming intervention report.32 Taylor-Robinson et al. 2015 does not find evidence that STH deworming affects haemoglobin levels (either in mass deworming programs or in a sub-analysis of studies that only treated infected children), and Kramer et al. 2014 appears to find that multiple doses of the drug metrifonate may affect haemoglobin levels but does not find effects on haemoglobin from providing a single dose of praziquantel (the deworming drug delivered by groups like the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative); we have not seen a recent meta-analysis that combines studies of metrifonate and praziquantel to determine the effect of any schistosomiasis treatment on haemoglobin.33

We have not yet reviewed these new meta-analyses in detail to determine how to reconcile them with the findings of our previous review. We have not prioritized this investigation since our best guess is that any effects on haemoglobin levels in modern contexts are likely to be small; effects on haemoglobin do not play a major role in our cost-effectiveness estimates.

## Other general health effects

Our best guess is that, in most cases, deworming does not have a large impact on other general health indicators.

Two recent systematic reviews of STH deworming, conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration and Campbell Collaboration (Taylor-Robinson et al. 2015 and Welch et al. 2017), find that deworming did not have an impact on outcomes such as cognition, height, and school performance.34

Welch et al. 2017 concludes that mass deworming for schistosomiasis alone "might slightly increase weight (0.41 kg, 95% CrI -0.20 to 0.91) and has little to no effect on height (low certainty evidence) and cognition (moderate certainty evidence)."35

We have not reviewed the above meta-analyses in detail. We are aware of an argument that effects of deworming on health indicators may be too small for mass deworming studies to pick up. We have not yet conducted formal analysis on this topic and have not determined the minimum effect sizes that were detectable in these meta-analyses.

## Prevention of potentially severe effects

In addition to subtle general health effects, deworming may avert more severe symptoms. Schistosomiasis can cause organ damage, particularly to the bladder, liver and kidneys, sometimes resulting in death, though these deaths appear highly infrequent and we have little information about the extent of non-fatal organ damage. Severe symptoms of STH appear infrequent and short in duration.

## Schistosomiasis

We have only identified one review36 (referred to here as "Van der Werf et al.") that systematically attempts to attribute severe symptoms (organ damage/malfunction, death) to schistosomiasis. This review discusses symptoms such as the presence of abnormal amounts of blood in the urine, self-reported painful urination, enlarged liver/spleen, and various signs of kidney stress or malfunction.37 However, this review is problematic for several reasons:

We find its methodology for attributing mortality/morbidity to schistosomiasis to be highly problematic.38

It estimates 280,000 annual deaths due to schistosomiasis;39 by contrast, the official burden of disease publication released by the World Health Organization in 2008 estimates 41,000 deaths.40 Because the latter cites Van der Werf et al. (2001)41 we take this as further evidence that the methodology used in Van der Werf et al. is problematic. Nearly all of the schistosomiasis consequences discussed in Van der Werf et al. (a) can sometimes be attributable to factors other than schistosomiasis; (b) range in severity and do not necessarily have any detectable impact on quality of life.42

Outside of this review, the only quantified information we have found on severe consequences of schistosomiasis involves deaths. It appears to us that even attributing deaths to schistosomiasis is very difficult, and estimates vary widely.43 Nonetheless, we regard the World Health Organization's 2004 estimate (published in 2008) of 41,000 deaths as the most credible.44 By comparison, the same source estimates that malaria results in roughly 890,000 deaths a year, more than twenty times as many, the vast majority of which are in children under 5.45

We can also get a sense of how bad the _non-death_ burden of schistosomiasis is estimated to be, using the World Health Organization's _disability-adjusted life-year_ (DALY) estimates. For each age group, we tabulated the ratio of DALYs (a measure of _all_ manifestations of disease burden) to YLLs (comparable to DALYs but only addressing mortality).46 These figures estimate that death accounts for about 80-90% of the burden of disease in people age 15-29; 90%-94% in people age 30-44; 95%+ in people age 45+; and only 10-20% in people under 14. This picture is consistent with the idea that older people are more likely to die due to schistosomiasis, while younger people are more likely to suffer other consequences such as subtle impacts on general health and developmental effects.

## 5th

The serious effects of soil-transmitted helminth infections vary by species.47 Because these severe symptoms are quite rare, we have found characterizing their frequency and severity to be difficult. The most thorough and up-to-date overview that we are aware of is the chapter on intestinal nematode infections (another name for soil-transmitted helminths) in the World Health Organization's _The Global Epidemiology of Infectious Disease_ publication. That chapter is the published version of the working paper that was used to generate the Disease Control Priorities report's cost-effectiveness estimate for soil-transmitted helminth treatment. For asceriasis, the most serious complication is short-term intestinal obstruction, sometimes resulting in death.48 We estimate that, each year, intestinal obstruction (which may require hospitalization and surgery and has an estimated duration of ~4 weeks) would occur in .026% of the school-age population of Sub-Saharan Africa (1 in ~3800 children per year) without treatment,49 resulting in about 3 deaths per million children per year of the school-age population.50

For trichuriais, heavy infections can result in a "dysenteric form" involving a bleeding/inflamed colon, discomfort and bloody stools, with a duration of 12 months or more51; this is estimated to occur about once a year per ~700 school-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa each year.52 It is unclear whether trichuriais causes mortality, but if it does, this is quite rare.53

Hookworm infection's most serious symptom is believed to be anemia.54 We discuss this symptom above and conclude that there is not strong evidence for an impact of deworming treatment on anemia; any such impact is likely to be small. It appears that the WHO has recently revised its estimates for STH deaths substantially downward. The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease report for 2001 (published in 2006) listed 1,000 deaths per year in sub-Saharan Africa for each of asceriasis and trichuriasis and 2,000 for hookworm, for a total of 4,000;55 but the Global Burden of Disease report for 2004 (published in 2008) lists a total of 412 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (for the 3 infections combined).56

In _Awasthi et al._2013, discussed in greater detail _above_, deworming of ascaris and hookworm resulted in a 5% reduction in risk of death between ages 1-6 from 2.65% to 2.52%, though the result was not statistically significant.57

## 4 Developmental impacts

In our view, the most compelling case for deworming as a cost-effective intervention does not come directly from its _subtle impacts on short-term health_ (which appear relatively minor and uncertain) nor from its _potential reduction in severe symptoms of disease effects_ (which we believe to be rare), but from the possibility that _deworming children has a subtle, lasting impact on their development and thus on their ability to be productive and successful throughout life. Empirical evidence on this matter is very limited, resting primarily on one series of experiments stemming from _Miguel and Kremer_2004.

### Short-term effects from Miguel and Kremer_2004

_Miguel and Kremer_2004 involved combination deworming, without prescreening, for some children and STH-only treatment for others (depending on the prevalence of schistosomiasis in the area).58 The program was not technically randomized but used a method we consider similar to randomization to determine who was treated.59 It found a ~25% reduction in school absenteeism, though no effect on test scores.60 It also found statistically significant impacts on self-reported sickness (both for "last week" and "often"), marginally significant results on height, and non-significant results on weight.61

### Follow-ups to Miguel and Kremer 2004

The below studies are follow-ups to Miguel and Kremer 2004. These studies analyzed data on children and young adults who had been involved in the deworming program in grade school, typically comparing children who started receiving deworming treatment earlier to those who started receiving it later.

**10-year follow-up:** Baird et al. 2016 compared the first two groups of schools to receive deworming (as treatment group) to the final group (as control); the treatment group was assigned 2.41 extra years of deworming on average.62 The study's headline effect is that as adults, those in the treatment group worked and earned substantially more,63 with increased earnings driven largely by a shift into the manufacturing sector.64 The study also found a positive impact on meals consumed, though not on overall consumption,65 and gains on self-reported health, though not on height or weight-for-height (and the treatment group had higher health expenditures).66 While the participants were still in school, the treatment group experienced small, non-statistically significant positive effects on school performance (though not on general intelligence).67

**5-year follow-up:** Baird 2007 (unpublished dissertation) analyzes a similar, early dataset from the same program, though it uses a different definition of "treatment group" than the later paper: while Baird et al. 2016 uses the first two groups of schools to receive treatment as its treatment group and the last as its control, Baird 2007 (unpublished dissertation) simply looks at the number of years of deworming assigned to each child.68 It finds contrasting, though also encouraging, results: some statistically significant impacts on height and weight years after the intervention,69 little to no impacts on education and labor market outcomes,70 and small but mostly insignificant negative impacts on cognitive performance.71

15-year follow-up: We have seen preliminary, confidential results from a 15-year follow-up to Miguel and Kremer 2004. We are not yet able to discuss the results in detail, but they are broadly consistent with the findings from the 10-year follow-up analyzed in Baird et al. 2016. We see the above studies as the most important evidence for the potential long-term effects of deworming. However, there are also two supplementary data points from long-term follow-ups to Miguel and Kremer 2004 that we believe provide some support for long-term effects, though they carry less weight in our conclusions:

10-year follow-up to a younger cohort who may have benefited from spillovers:

Ozier 2015 assesses the impact of Miguel and Kremer 2004's intervention on infants who were not directly treated but lived in the same communities as treated children. These infants may have benefited from spillover effects (i.e. if fewer children in a community had infections because they were dewormed, then younger untreated children may have been less likely to acquire infections). Ozier 2015 concludes, "Ten years after the intervention, I find large cognitive effects--comparable to between 0.5 and 0.8 years of schooling--for children who were less than one year old when their communities received mass deworming treatment."72 We have not yet carefully reviewed and replicated this study; we may conduct further analysis on this study in the future.

Follow-ups to cost-sharing experiment: Kremer and Miguel 2007 was a randomized controlled trial conducted in the same sample of children studied in Miguel and Kremer 2004. It randomly assigned a group of schools to a treatment condition in which parents were required to pay a fee (which it refers to as "cost-sharing") in order for their child to receive deworming treatment.73 It found that making treatment conditional on payment reduced take-up by about 80%.74 Baird et al. 2016 assesses the long-term effects of randomly being assigned to the cost-sharing group and finds that this group (which received less deworming) experienced negative effects on outcomes such as hours worked, meals eaten, and log wage earnings; these results are only sometimes statistically significant, with significance often depending on details of regression specifications.75 Though the estimates are imprecise, it appears that the effect size on earnings from receiving less deworming due to cost-sharing is roughly consistent with what would be expected given the estimate of deworming treatment on earnings in the core deworming treatment group from Baird et al. 2016.76

We have done a variety of analyses to assess the robustness of the core findings from Baird et al. 2016, including reanalyzing the data and code underlying the study, and the results have held up to our scrutiny. For more information, see:

A reanalysis that we conducted in 2012 in order to explore several reservations we had about the study: see our 2012 blog post and full writeup. Our examination resulted in an overall higher level of confidence in the studies than we had had previously, though many concerns remain. We wrote a July 2015 blog post about our views on two re-analyses of Miguel and Kremer 2004 and an updated Cochrane review on deworming published in 2015. These studies did not substantively change our conclusions.

GiveWell Senior Advisor David Roodman assessed the overall case for deworming and the ongoing debate over its effects in 2016; blog posts summarizing this work can be found here and here. However, we continue to believe that there are reasons to be cautious in interpreting Miguel and Kremer 2004 and follow-up studies:

The conditions at the time of treatment are unlikely to be representative of other contexts: there was extraordinary flooding in the study area due to the El Nino climate pattern, which led to abnormally high prevalence of heavier worm infections.77

In general, we hesitate to place too much weight on a finding from a single study (or a small number of studies) because of the potential for publication bias as well as possible alternative explanations for the findings. For example, efforts to encourage students to attend school in order to receive treatment might have bled over to later days, increasing attendance in treatment schools over the following years. The particular piece of data that led us to examine this possibility is that within schools, there is no statistically significant difference in attendance rates for treated and untreated students (the effects only appear across schools). (The authors assume that this phenomenon occurred due to the presence of within-school externalities.) For further discussion of potential limitations of these studies, see Jullien, Sinclair, and Garner 2016 and commentary responding to the paper, including David Roodman's response (Roodman 2017, comment on Jullien, Sinclair, and Garner 2016).

## Other studies of long-term effects

In previous versions of this report, we discussed two other studies that analyzed the long-term effects of deworming campaigns and found positive impacts on outcomes such as cognitive test scores and income: **Croke 2014** and **Bleakley 2007**. However, after further investigation and updates based on new data, we no longer believe that these studies provide substantial support for the theory that deworming has long-term impacts. The below updates have weakened the support for long-term impacts:

**Croke 2014** followed up on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a deworming program in Uganda and found higher scores on tests of literacy and numeracy in children living in treatment areas compared to the control 7 to 8 years later.78 Since publication of **Croke 2014**, four additional years of relevant test score data have become available. After adding this new data into the analysis, Croke finds that the effects of deworming on test scores remain positive but are statistically indistinguishable from zero. This updated analysis is not yet published, but we have corresponded with author Kevin Croke, and he aims to publish this update in the next year.

### Bieakley 2007 analyzes the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission's campaign to eradicate hookworm in the American South in the early 20th century and concludes that there is suggestive evidence that this campaign had short-term effects on school enrollment, attendance, and literacy, and long-term effects on income.79 However, GiveWell Senior Advisor David Roodman has conducted a detailed replication and reanalysis of these findings and has concluded that they do not provide robust suggestive evidence for the hypothesis that deworming had substantial life impacts. For more information, see this blog post and its accompanying report, Roodman 2017, replication and reanalysis of Bleakley 2007.

### Bottom line on developmental effects

We find it highly plausible that deworming has subtle but significant developmental effects that improve quality of later life. The studies on this topic have substantial limitations, and we do not consider them conclusive evidence for the presence (much less for the size) of these effects, even in conditions similar to those in the trials. We do consider them suggestive evidence, enough to take the possibility of developmental effects seriously. We further discuss how strong we find the case for developmental effects of deworming to be, in comparison with the case for long-term effects of other interventions, in a 2012 blog post.

### Externalities for the untreated

It is possible that deworming benefits people who do not receive treatment by reducing overall prevalence of worm infections in a community. The only evidence we have seen for this idea comes from the same Kenya program discussed above. Miguel and Kremer 2004 found significant impacts on children in nearby but untreated schools.80 In addition, Ozier 2011 (an earlier version of Ozier 2015) reviewed later data on younger children, and concluded:

Community deworming before a child's first birthday brings about a 0.2-standard-deviation improvement in performance on Raven's Matrices, a decade after the intervention. Estimated effects on vocabulary measures are similar in magnitude, but not always as significant; effects on memory are not statistically distinguishable from zero. A summary measure, the first principal component of all six cognitive measurements, also shows a roughly 0.2-standard-deviation effect. These effects are equivalent to between 0.5 and 0.8 additional grades in school ... The effect of community deworming spillovers on height, height-for-age, and stunting all appear statistically indistinguishable from zero.81

For reasons discussed above, we believe these studies are likely to overstate the impact of deworming, and that this overstatement is particularly likely to be an issue for externalities due to the unusual flooding and elevated level of infections. In addition, we note that the unusual design of Miguel and Kremer 2004 (in which nearby schools were assigned to be dewormed earlier or later in an essentially arbitrary way) is unlikely to be representative of large-scale school-based deworming campaigns such as those of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative or the Deworm the World Initiative. That said, we think it is worth noting the possibility of externalities, as this could both (a) increase the cost-effectiveness of deworming beyond what we estimate below; (b) imply that some of the research on deworming reviewed above may understate the impact of deworming because "control" groups may have actually been positive affected by deworming.

# Possible negative/offsetting impact

Impact on the routine health system. Cavalli et al 2010, a study of a mass deworming campaign in two rural districts in Mali, states: "At point of delivery, campaign-related workload severely interfered with routine care delivery which was cut down or totally interrupted during the campaign, as nurses were absent from their health centre for campaign-related activities."82

Side effects of drugs. Albendazole and praziquantel may both have side effects, including headache, abdominal pain, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, and fever.83 These effects seem better-understood, and potentially painful but temporary, for praziquantel. There are some more serious claims for albendazole (adverse effects on growth; "reports of elevated liver enzymes, headaches, loss of hair, low levels of white blood cells (neutropenia), fever, and itching if taken at higher doses and/or for a long period of time"),84 we do not have evidence on these, but note that albendazole treatment (as discussed above) seems to generally have effects that are positive or else not statistically significant. Possible development of drug resistance. The widespread use of deworming drugs may cause resistance to emerge, as has already occurred in STH of livestock.85 As far as we know, there is no strong evidence of resistance among human STHs, but we have not deeply investigated this question.86

Possible transmission of disease via deworming pills. If those administering or taking deworming pills have dirty hands, they may transmit disease while administering/taking the pill. Choking on deworming pills. Taylor-Robinson et al. 2012, the Cochrane review on STH-only deworming, notes the possibility that children might choke on deworming pills and cites the WHO's concerns about the issue.87 An article in "The Times of India" reported in 2012 that a child died in Hyderabad by choking on a deworming tablet.88

The effect of deworming on malaria. Nacher 2011 reviews observational studies and RCTs on the interactions between worm infections and malaria.89 Based on Nacher 2011 and our own search for studies, we know of 5 RCTs examining the effect of deworming on malaria (Brutus et al 2006, Brutus et al 2007, Kirwan et al 2010, Wiria et al 2013 and Kinung'hi et al 2015).90 We summarize the RCTs below and tentatively conclude that anti-helminthic treatment may increase malaria parasitemia (i.e., the presence of malaria parasites in the blood) and/or the density of malaria parasites in the blood in school-aged children, but scant evidence supports an increase in incidence of symptomatic malaria cases or greater severity of malaria cases due to deworming. We note, however, that the relationship between deworming and malaria seems complex and poorly understood.91

Brutus et al 2006 found that levamisole, an anti-helminthic, increased the density of P. falciparum (malaria parasites) in blood samples in school-aged children compared to a control group in a rural area of Madagascar.92 The study found no apparent effect in children under 5 years old.93 The study also reported that 2.5% of the control group and 3.3% of the treatment group received chloroquine (treatment for malaria) after presenting with fever and parasitemia over the course of the study.94 The study population had an infection rate of around 27% for Ascaris lumbricoides, around 9% for Schistosoma mansoni, and around 9% for Necator americanus.95

Brutus et al 2007 appears to have found similar results as Brutus et al 2006 with a similar study design also in a rural area of Madagascar though one at higher altitudes and with different malaria and worm transmission patterns.96 The study population had an infection rate of around 59% for Ascaris lumbricoides, around 44% for Schistosoma mansoni and close to 0% for Necator americanus.97

The treatment group in Kirwan et al 2010 had a statistically significantly higher Plasmodium (malaria parasite) prevalence and average Plasmodium parasite density than the control group at baseline.98 However, the study concluded that albendazole slowed an increase in the odds of having a Plasmodium infection in the treatment group over the course of the study compared to the control group (both groups consisted of children between 12 and 59 months old).99 The study population had an infection rate of around 46% of Ascaris lumbricoides, around 3% of Trichuris trichiura, around 4% of hookworm and around 1% of Schistosoma haematobium.100

###### Abstract

The World Health Organization recommends annual treatment for schistosomiasis and twice-annual treatment for soil-transmitted helminths for preschool- and school-aged children in areas with prevalence above 50%. [106] In areas with lower prevalence, the World Health Organization recommends less frequent deworming. We have not been able to fully understand the rationale for the World Health Organization's recommendations. The underlying principle is that reinfection rates are higher in areas with greater prevalence, so more frequent deworming will be necessary to avoid morbidity in those areas, but we have not found evidence that shows the superiority of annual treatment (as compared with, e.g., semi-annual or bi-annual treatment).

The World Health Organization's recommendations about which groups of people to treat also vary with prevalence; in low-prevalence areas, treatment is restricted to preschool- and school-aged children and certain categories of adults.108 We do not know how the cost-effectiveness of treating adults in high-prevalence areas compares with the cost-effectiveness of treating children. The main reason for focusing deworming treatment on children is that, with the exception of hookworm, the prevalence of the helminths and schistosomes is highest in childhood.109 Although deworming in childhood does not prevent adults from being reinfected with new worms, the theory underlying mass treatment is that it does prevent the developmental effects of having worms in childhood and the serious organ damage that can result from long-term high-intensity infections.100

We believe it is important that deworming programs are sustained over time, as re-infection is rapid and a one-time treatment may have little long-term effect.11 We have not yet deeply investigated whether it may be more cost-effective to aim for elimination of worms (i.e., treating everyone in a community to eliminate transmission of worm infections) than control of worms (i.e., reducing infections through school-based deworming programs as typically conducted by deworming charities).

We have had one conversation with DeWorm3, an initiative that plans to test the feasibility of elimination of worms in the field (GiveWell's non-verbatim summary of a conversation with DeWorm3, February 24, 2016) and we are aware of some relevant studies such as Lo et al. 2015.

## How cost-effective is mass deworming?

See the most recent version of our deworming cost-effectiveness analysis on this page. We have attempted to quantify _longer-term developmental impacts_ by working off of the effects found in the Kenya studies discussed above, and making adjustments for what we perceive as unrepresentativeness or other questions around these studies.

We have attempted to quantify _short-term health impacts_ using information from the Disease Control Priorities Report. Doing so has raised substantial challenges. We have found significant errors in this report's analysis that stood uncorrected in the several years between the report's publication and our 2011 investigation, and estimates of the frequency and severity of symptoms are difficult to interpret and appear to be grounded in very little in the way of empirical data. Details on how we have used this information to estimate short-term health impacts are available at our 2011 deworming report. These calculations are highly sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding:

Adjustments for the limitations of the evidence base for deworming. Prevalence of different infections where deworming takes place. We have little information allowing us to separate the effects of different infections. Frequency of treatment. We estimate that deworming programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible.

## Is there room for more funding in deworming?

We believe there is substantial room to do more deworming in suitable countries. Details at our reviews of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and the Deworm the

## 2014

In 2014, we limited our update to searching for RCTs examining the long-term effects of deworming, because we believed that work had the highest chance of impacting our view for the amount of research time invested. We found Croke 2014, discussed the results with Dr. Kevin Croke and published a blog post on our findings.

## 2015

We reviewed two updated papers (Ozier 2015 and Baird et al 2015 - November) on studies we already discuss in the intervention report (Ozier 2011 and Baird et al. 2012). These updated papers reach substantially the same conclusions as the previous papers.12

We also searched for new, well-identified studies on the long-term effects of deworming. In particular, we searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 containing the phrase "Croke 2014" under the assumption that new studies on the long-term effects would cite Croke 2014 and we checked if Ozier 2015 and Baird et al 2015 - November cited any new studies on the long-term effects of deworming. We did not find any new studies. Giving What We Can raised the question of whether deworming against STH might increase malaria intensity or prevalence.13 We did a preliminary assessment of the

evidence on the effect of deworming on malaria and updated the section on "Possible negative/offsetting impact." We blogged about two re-analyses of Miguel and Kremer 2004 and an updated Cochrane review on deworming published in 2015. These studies did not substantively change our conclusions.

## 2017

We updated this page to include analyses that we had conducted on deworming since our last intervention report update, such as Senior Advisor David Roodman's blog posts covering his overall assessment of the evidence (here and here), updated views on Croke 2014 (discussed above), and Roodman's reanalysis of Bleakley 2007 (here). We briefly reviewed other potentially relevant papers that we became aware of since our last intervention report update. We discussed some relevant new papers above but deprioritized deeply reviewing several individual papers because they seemed unlikely to meaningfully update our view of the intervention. For details on papers we deprioritized, see GiveWell, 2017 review of deworming literature: deprioritized papers. To learn about potentially relevant papers, we have set up Google Scholar alerts so that we are notified when new studies cite the key papers discussed in this intervention report (e.g. Miguel and Kremer 2004, Baird et al. 2016, and Taylor-Robinson et al. 2015). We also learn about relevant research papers through a variety of other channels, including speaking with researchers and charities focused on deworming. We updated the "impacts on general health" section of this report to reflect the conclusions from Roodman's recent analysis and recently published systematic reviews. We also reviewed our deworming cost-effectiveness analysis and provided more detailed explanations for several inputs; see the most recent version of our core cost
