## About us

Established in 2003, Malaria Consortium is one of the world's leading non-profit organisations specialising in the prevention, control and treatment of malaria and other communicable diseases among vulnerable populations. 

### Our mission is to save lives and improve health in Africa and Asia, through evidence-based programmes that combat targeted diseases and promote universal health coverage. 

We will accomplish this together with partners and all levels of government, by:

* designing and implementing cutting edge research, surveillance and monitoring and evaluation;
* selectively scaling up and delivering sustainable evidence-based health programmes;
* providing technical assistance and consulting services that shape and strengthen national and international health policies, strategies and systems and build local capacity;
* seeking to ensure that our experience, thought leadership, practical findings and research results are effectively communicated and contribute to the coordinated improvement of access to and quality of healthcare. 

Our areas of expertise include:

* disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment
* disease control and elimination
* health systems strengthening
* research, monitoring and evaluation leading to best practice
* behaviour change communication
* national and international advocacy, and policy development

### Our structure

With 95 percent of our staff working in malaria endemic areas, we currently have programmes and projects in 12 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia. Our local insight, embedded technical expertise and practical skills give us the agility to respond to critical challenges quickly and effectively. Our unique structure and robust approach to tackling malaria and other diseases enable us to deliver among the most cost-effective public health programmes, even in complex and challenging environments. Collaboration and cooperation with others through our work is fundamental to our approach and we are proud to work closely with communities, governments, academic institutions, and local and international organisations. 

### Our difference

We are dedicated to ensuring our work is supported by strong evidence and remains grounded in the lessons we learn through implementation. We explore beyond current practice, to try out innovative ways - through research, implementation and policy development - to achieve effective and sustainable disease management and control. We have pioneered best practices and approaches, setting the standards that others now follow. You can find out more about Malaria Consortium's current and past work from our Annual Reviews.
