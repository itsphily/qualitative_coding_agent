# Malaria Consortium - Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention

Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention program is one of our top-rated charities and we believe that it offers donors an outstanding opportunity to accomplish good with their donations. More information: What is our evaluation process? Published: November 2020

## Summary

What do they do? Malaria Consortium (malariaconsortium.org) works on preventing, controlling, treating, and eliminating malaria and other communicable diseases in Africa and Asia. We have only reviewed its seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program, which distributes preventive antimalarial drugs to children 3 to 59 months old in order to prevent illness and death from malaria, typically in four monthly cycles during the high transmission season; our recommendation is just for this part of Malaria Consortium's work. (More)

**Does it work?** There is strong evidence that SMC substantially reduces cases of malaria. Malaria Consortium has conducted studies in the countries where it has worked to determine whether its programs have reached a large proportion of children targeted. Surveys conducted in 2017-19 found that on average, 93% of targeted children received at least one month of SMC (out of four possible months), 81% received at least two months, 70% received at least three months, and 56% received all four months. (More)

**What do you get for your dollar?** We estimate that the total cost to achieve the equivalent of four person-months of SMC coverage is $6.59. The numbers of deaths averted and other benefits of SMC are a function of a number of difficult-to-estimate factors, which we discuss below. (More)

**Is there room for more funding?** We believe that Malaria Consortium could use more funding than it expects to receive to scale up its SMC activities. We estimate that Malaria Consortium could absorb up to $44.7 million for work in 2022-2023. (More)

**Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention program is recommended because:**

- SMC is a program with a strong evidence base and strong cost-effectiveness. (**More**)
- Track record - Malaria Consortium has experience with supporting large-scale SMC programs in seven countries and has demonstrated success at reaching a large portion of targeted children. (**More**)
- Room for more funding - we believe that Malaria Consortium could productively use more funding than it expects to receive to scale up its SMC activities. (**More**)

## Our review process

We began speaking to Malaria Consortium about the possibility of reviewing one of its programs in January 2016. Over the next several months we tried to determine which of Malaria Consortium's programs we should prioritize evaluating for a possible recommendation, and we ultimately settled on seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC). The other programs that we investigated included: bed nets, dengue control, injectable artesunate for severe malaria, integrated community case management (ICCM), micronutrient powders, malnutrition management, neglected tropical diseases morbidity management, integration of nutrition with SMC, prevention of malaria in pregnancy, point of care diagnosis of malaria, and diagnosis of pneumonia. Our review process has consisted of:

- Extensive conversations with Malaria Consortium staff since 2016.1
- A conversation with a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who has led the work on evaluating the ACCESS-SMC project, a large-scale SMC project led by Malaria Consortium.2
- Reviewing documents that Malaria Consortium shared with us.

## What do they do? Malaria Consortium works on preventing, controlling, treating, and eliminating malaria and other communicable diseases.3 It was established in 2003 and currently works in twelve countries across Africa and Southeast Asia.4

Malaria Consortium's total spending from April 2018 to March 2019 was about $48 million, with about 89% of its spending coming from restricted funds.5

This page focuses exclusively on its seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) programs, which aim to distribute preventive anti-malarial drugs to children 3 months to 59 months old in order to prevent illness and death from malaria.6

The remainder of this section provides more detail on:

### Implementation of SMC programs

#### What are SMC programs?

As we wrote in our **intervention report on SMC**, seasonal malaria chemoprevention is the monthly administration of full preventive courses of antimalarial medicines to children during the malaria season in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission.7 According to WHO policy recommendation, it "consists of administering a maximum of four treatment courses of SP [sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine] + AQ [amodiaquine] at monthly intervals to children aged 3-59 months in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission [during the high malaria transmission period]. "8 SMC was "formerly known as 'intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in children [IPTc]. "9

According to the World Health Organization (WHO):

The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas:

- where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months;
- where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season);
- where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.10

According to the WHO, "SMC provides protection for up to [28 days] after each complete (3-day) course... [Community distributors] should give the dose of SP and the first dose of AQ to the children under their direct observation and should advise the children's caregivers on how to give the second and third [daily] doses of AQ to the child at home [one dissolved tablet per day, for two days]. "11

### Malaria Consortium SMC implementation methods

#### Malaria Consortium supports training of health facility workers and community distributors (CDs) to deliver SMC primarily by going door-to-door.12 Malaria Consortium told us that many CDs are community health workers (CHWs), who are people in the community who work year-round to support basic delivery of health interventions such as vaccines; malaria diagnosis, referral and treatment; nutrition programs, etc. Some CDs are recruited and trained to only deliver SMC and do not provide any other community health services.13 Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.14 Malaria Consortium also supports training for supervisors for the program.15

#### Malaria Consortium typically supports four SMC "cycles." Each cycle includes a four-day distribution period and lasts 28 days, at which point a new cycle starts.16 For each cycle, Malaria Consortium instructs CDs to:17

1. determine whether the child is eligible for SMC and give the age appropriate dose.18
2. refer all acutely sick children and children with fever to the health facility for evaluation and testing for malaria.19
3. directly observe the child swallowing the first dose of dispersible SP+AQ, and then re-dose if the child vomits or spits out all of the medicine within 30 minutes of taking the first dose of the medication.20
4. give the child's caregiver 2 tablets of AQ and explain how to give the doses over the following two days.21
5. record all doses provided on a tally sheet and mark the wall of the household or compound as visited.22
6. advise the child's caregivers to mark a card to record that they've given the other two doses,23 to give the medication again if the child vomits (and to visit the health facility to request replacement doses if this happens), and to take the child to the health facility if they get a fever or are very sick.24
7. provide health promotion and malaria prevention messages, including explaining the purpose and benefit of SMC and the importance of children and pregnant women sleeping inside a bed net each night.25

This is a diagram of the delivery schedule:

Malaria Consortium instructs CDs not to administer SPAQ to children who: are younger than 3 months or 60 months and older; have a fever or are severely ill (these children should be referred to the local health facility); are taking another sulfa-based medication such as cotrimoxazole; have received another dose of AQ or SP during the past month; or have an allergy to a sulfa-based medication, AQ, or SP.26 Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages,27 in order to check for these issues.28 We do not know how often CDs follow all of the suggested instructions in practice. Malaria Consortium notes that program supervisors oversee CDs to provide mentoring and ensure compliance with SMC guidelines.29

Malaria Consortium instructs CDs to give a lower dose to children more than 3 but less than 12 months old than they give to children 12 to 59 months old.30 The co-blistered drug packets are color-coded, are different sizes, and include pictures of an infant or a child, and CDs are trained to ask caregivers a set of questions and look for age-related milestones to establish the age of the child.31

Malaria Consortium supports activities to promote community engagement and social and behavior change before and during SMC campaigns.32

Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years. See this spreadsheet for a list of Malaria Consortium's SMC operational research projects in 2019. More details on how Malaria Consortium assesses the coverage achieved by the SMC programs it supports are below.

Malaria Consortium told us that there are several challenges with delivering SMC, including insecurity, flooding, and road access during the rainy season, as well as conflicting community health campaigns, such as vaccination campaigns.33

## Malaria Consortium-supported SMC programs

We have seen information from three major SMC projects that Malaria Consortium has supported:

**Pilot and scale-up of SMC in northern Nigeria:** The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) provided about $1.7 million to Malaria Consortium to do operational research on the best way to deliver SMC at scale in Katsina state in northern Nigeria, and then to implement its chosen delivery system and assess its efficiency and impact.34 Malaria Consortium told us that it trained over 3,600 CDs and nearly 200 health workers to provide about 1.6 million courses of SMC to roughly 350,000 children who lived in 4 "local government areas" (LGAs) in northern Nigeria in 2012-2014.35 A major goal of the project was to share what it learned; we have seen a published paper that describes the use of research to inform the design of an SMC intervention in northern Nigeria but have not yet reviewed it in detail.36

## ACCESS-SMC

Unitaid awarded up to $67 million to Malaria Consortium to lead a project called ACCESS-SMC to reach up to 7 million children per year in seven countries in the Sahel region of Africa in 2015-2017.37 The project, which Malaria Consortium described in 2014 as being the "largest-yet global programme" for SMC, concluded in February 2018.38 ACCESS-SMC was led by Malaria Consortium, with Catholic Relief Services as the "primary sub-grantee" and support from many other organizations, including impact evaluation from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).39 Malaria Consortium told us that its role in ACCESS-SMC included leading implementation of SMC in three of the seven ACCESS-SMC countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, and Nigeria), overseeing budgets and planning for all ACCESS-SMC activities, and overseeing research (including methodology and presentation).40 Our impression is that ACCESS-SMC paid for almost all aspects of program implementation and monitoring, including medicines and supplies, per diems for CDs, training for CDs, trainers, supervisors, and health facility workers, and research.41

**General SMC program funded primarily by GiveWell-directed funds:** Since 2017, Malaria Consortium has been using funding received as a result of GiveWell's recommendation (which we refer to as "GiveWell-directed funds") to support SMC programs in several countries. Over time, the total number of children targeted by these programs has increased from 650,000 in 2017 to 5.8 million in 2019. In 2019, Malaria Consortium used GiveWell-directed funds to target approximately 1.3 million children in 23 districts in Burkina Faso, approximately 1 million children in 20 districts in Chad, and approximately 3.5 million children in 68 LGAs in Nigeria.42 In all three years, GiveWell-directed funds have also supported supervision, monitoring, and evaluation of these programs.43 In 2019, Malaria Consortium also received funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to implement SMC in additional states in Nigeria, reaching approximately 340,000 children.44

Malaria Consortium told us that the above programs represent the bulk of Malaria Consortium's work on SMC so far.45

## Malaria Consortium's spending on SMC programs

Between January and December 2019, Malaria Consortium spent about $22.2 million in GiveWell-directed funds.46

$8.1 million (37%) on SMC drugs, along with freight and procurement costs

$8.5 million (38%) on SMC implementation (including planning for SMC campaigns, training of supervisors and CDs, administration of SMC drugs, community engagement, and monitoring and evaluation, including coverage surveys)

$2.7 million (12%) on staff and travel costs

$0.2 million (1%) on research,47 communications, and advocacy48

$2.6 million (12%) on overhead costs

Of this $22.2 million, Malaria Consortium spent $11 million (50%) in Nigeria, $5.4 million (24%) in Burkina Faso, and $4.4 million (20%) in Chad--or 53%, 26%, and 21% respectively, with above-country spending allocated proportionally across countries.49

For prior work, we have also seen spending data from the pilot and scale-up of SMC in northern Nigeria,50 from 2016 for the ACCESS-SMC program,51 and from 2017 and 2018 for programs supported by GiveWell-directed funds.52

We also provide some information on the estimated cost per child covered of Malaria Consortium-supported SMC programs **below**.

# Malaria Consortium's role in SMC programs

Malaria Consortium's SMC work varies by country, but in general includes the following activities.53 Determining the quantity of drugs needed, procurement of drugs, and international shipping54 Procurement and distribution of other SMC commodities55 Funding distributions, including in-country storage and transportation of drugs and payments to front-line distributors to compensate them for the time they spend on the program Technical assistance and logistical support for training SMC implementers, targeted supervision, community engagement and social and behavior change, drug safety, and review of prior implementation and revisions to procedures Financial management and oversight, including disbursing funds to local organizations, Ministries of Health, and/or CDs, collecting and validating receipts, and preparing financial reports Developing training and supervision materials and training staff at various levels56 Monitoring and evaluation, including direct observation of program activities by Malaria Consortium staff, funding and coordinating with research firms and academic institutions to conduct coverage surveys and to track changes in malaria incidence and death, and monitoring of drug resistance.57

Advocacy and fundraising with governments, international, multinational, and bilateral organizations, donors, SMC working groups, researchers, and civil society. Conducting research that addresses knowledge gaps relating to SMC delivery, quality, and impact, writing and disseminating lessons learned and publications in peer-reviewed journals, and presenting at international global health conferences. See this spreadsheet for a list of Malaria Consortium's SMC operational research projects in 2019. Malaria Consortium notes that in 2020, it continued to implement SMC during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching approximately 12 million children. Malaria Consortium established enhanced safety and infection prevention guidance for program delivery, which included providing guidance for SMC delivery by community distributors, procuring items such as face masks and hand sanitizer, and revising training and supervision documents and job aids.58

## Does it work?

We base our expectation of the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC programs on:
1. The evidence of effectiveness of SMC at reducing malaria incidence.
2. Characteristics of the areas targeted by Malaria Consortium's SMC programs (including malaria incidence and seasonality).
3. Evidence that a high proportion of targeted children have received SMC in past rounds.

We believe that the above provides strong indirect evidence that Malaria Consortium's SMC programs reduce malaria incidence in the populations they target. We also consider whether there is direct evidence of such reductions in these populations. Finally, we consider whether there are factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that would offset the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC programs, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes.

## Is SMC an effective intervention?

Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide strong evidence that SMC substantially reduces cases of malaria. We discuss this evidence in our intervention report on SMC. We incorporate SMC's impact on malaria incidence, as measured by these RCTs, into our cost-effectiveness model.59

## Are Malaria Consortium's SMC programs targeted at areas where they are likely to be effective?

Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.60 We have not reviewed this evidence in detail, but it seems highly likely to us that Malaria Consortium is working in areas that are suitable for SMC because it is working in countries with high malaria burdens and where it seems that malaria is seasonal.61 More information on our estimates of malaria burden in the countries where Malaria Consortium is working is available in our cost-effectiveness model.62

## Are targeted children reached with SMC?

Malaria Consortium conducts coverage surveys to determine what proportion of the target population (children aged 3-59 months) was reached with SMC in the previous round or cycle. We use results from past SMC rounds to understand the impact we should expect future rounds to have. Specifically, we use coverage survey results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the **cost of delivering SMC to a child**. Our interpretation of these coverage survey results is informed by their comprehensiveness and the methodology used to collect them.

## Comprehensiveness

See this spreadsheet for all coverage survey results we have seen from Malaria Consortium's SMC programs. In short, we have seen results from 2015-16 in the seven countries that Malaria Consortium supported through the ACCESS-SMC project and from 2017-19 in the three countries that Malaria Consortium currently supports through its general SMC program (Burkina Faso, Chad, and Nigeria).63 We thus believe that we have seen a thorough picture of the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC program; we incorporate this assessment into our cost-effectiveness model.64

We focus our review on results from 2017 onward from Burkina Faso, Chad, and Nigeria, as we believe they are more likely to be indicative of what we can expect from future SMC rounds in those countries.

## Methodology

Since 2017, Malaria Consortium has conducted two types of coverage surveys. After each of the first three cycles in the SMC round, it conducts a post-cycle coverage survey to measure coverage in the previous cycle only.65 After the fourth and final cycle in the SMC round, it conducts a post-round coverage survey to measure coverage across the full round.66 Both post-cycle and post-round surveys involve household interviews with caregivers of SMC-eligible children. Full details of the methodology used in the surveys we have reviewed are in this spreadsheet. Below, we summarize Malaria Consortium's general post-cycle and post-round coverage survey methodology and discuss methodological strengths and weaknesses.

Overall, we believe that both types of surveys are designed to measure key indicators of the success of SMC campaigns and to achieve samples that are generally representative of target populations. However, we are concerned that the self-reported nature of responses and data collectors' involvement in the later stages of respondent selection may produce bias in results. We are also uncertain about the quality of survey implementation due to the lack of a procedure to audit data collectors' work. We incorporate our assessment of the quality of Malaria Consortium's coverage survey methodology into our cost-effectiveness model67 and into our qualitative assessment of Malaria Consortium's organizational strength.

**Respondent selection:** Post-cycle surveys employ lot quality assurance sampling68 in which the program area is subdivided into smaller units, generally of approximately equal population size, and a small number of households is randomly selected from each unit.69 This approach is designed to assess whether each unit met a target coverage level; data from all units can be aggregated to calculate coverage across the program area. Because all units are sampled and are of approximately equal population size, we expect this selection protocol to result in a sample that is generally representative of the target population.70 Post-round surveys employ multi-stage cluster sampling of households in the program area, with sampling units above the household level generally selected randomly with probability proportional to size.71 We expect this selection protocol to result in a sample that is generally representative of the target population. For both types of surveys, data collectors are instructed to randomly select households and children to survey. In each community, data collectors are instructed to spin a bottle at a central point to choose a direction along which they then select a predetermined number of households at a predetermined interval.72 This method may lead households closer to the center of a community to be overrepresented in the sample.73

We are unsure of how this might bias results, though it seems plausible that households on the outskirts of a community may have been less likely to be reached by SMC, and thus that results would be biased upward. Next, data collectors enter all eligible children in a selected household, along with whether or not those children received SPAQ in the most recent cycle, into survey software. The survey software then randomly selects two children, independent of whether or not they received SPAQ, from each household. These two children are split into two groups, a "treatment group" and a "non-treatment group." In the non-treatment group, a series of follow-up questions are asked about children who did not receive SPAQ. In the treatment group, no follow-up questions are asked about children who did not receive SPAQ. In both the treatment and non-treatment group, a complete questionnaire is administered for children who did receive SPAQ. Coverage rates are calculated only from the treatment group and are therefore based on a sample in which data were obtained for only one child per household.72

We see data collectors' involvement in the later stages of respondent selection as a concern. Data collectors may apply selection procedures incorrectly, either unintentionally or intentionally. If, for example, they purposefully select households that are easier to reach, this would be a potential source of upward bias, as households that are easier to reach may also have been more likely to be reached by SMC. We note that we have seen no evidence that data collectors intentionally applied selection procedures incorrectly and note it only as a possibility. If a selected household is unavailable or refuses to participate in the survey, data collectors are instructed to move to the next household according to the sampling procedure. In the 2019 post-round surveys, 98% or higher of the targeted number of households were interviewed.73 This could mean that non-response rates (i.e. households randomly selected to be interviewed not being interviewed) were low. However, because we do not know how often replacement households were used, it is also possible that a high proportion of interviewed households were replacement households, so these survey completion rates only slightly increase our confidence in the accuracy of results from these surveys. We have not seen survey completion rates from 2019 post-cycle surveys and have not reviewed these rates from prior years.

**Survey design:** Malaria Consortium has developed post-cycle and post-round questionnaires,74 which are adapted for use in each country and translated from English into French in Burkina Faso and Chad.75 These questionnaires instruct data collectors to ask caregivers questions about whether their child received SPAQ during the previous cycle (in the case of post-cycle surveys) or during all four cycles of the round (in the case of post-round surveys). Both questionnaires ask about SPAQ provided by a CD on the first day of each cycle and about AQ provided by the caregiver on the second and third days of each cycle. They also ask questions about the quality of program delivery. Data collectors translate questions from English or French into local languages during household interviews,76 which may lead to inconsistencies in translation and reduce the accuracy of results.

A potential source of bias in Malaria Consortium's coverage surveys is their heavy reliance on self-reported responses. Post-round responses are at high risk of recall bias, as they report on up to twelve doses,77 the first of which would have occurred at least three months prior.78 Post-cycle responses are at lower risk of recall bias, as they ask only about three doses and are conducted within a month of those doses. Self-reported responses are also at risk of social desirability bias that could lead caregivers to overreport SMC administration, if they believe that this is the preferred response of data collectors. We expect responses about caregivers' own administration on the second and third days of each cycle to be at greater risk of this type of bias, as they may feel pressure to overreport their own adherence to program guidance. Because the coverage estimates we use are based on responses about CDs' administration on the first day of each cycle,79 about which we believe caregivers may feel less pressure to report positively, this is a smaller concern. We would have more confidence in a survey that tested the reliability of self-reported responses against some objective measure. In order to verify caregiver responses, data collectors are instructed to review children's SMC record cards and medicine blister packs, if available.80 However, retention of these items has generally been low, leading Malaria Consortium to place low weight on them as indicators of coverage.81

**Survey implementation:** Malaria Consortium contracts with local research organizations that recruit data collectors and oversee survey implementation.82 Individuals involved in the surveys generally were not involved in SMC delivery, which suggests that they are unlikely to have a personal interest in survey outcomes.83 Malaria Consortium reports that in Chad, the 2018 post-cycle surveys and the first 2019 post-cycle survey conducted by local research organizations were of low quality.84 This may have impacted the accuracy of results, but we are uncertain about the magnitude or direction of this impact. Malaria Consortium's coverage surveys do not systematically incorporate an auditing procedure to assess the accuracy of data collectors' work.85 We see this as a methodological weakness, both because such a procedure may encourage accurate data collection and because it would provide a check on the accuracy of results.

**Data capture:** Data is collected electronically in both post-cycle and post-round coverage surveys and uploaded to a remote server at the end of each day of data collection.86 One concern we have about coverage surveys in general is that data may be lost after being collected. As mentioned above, for the surveys from which we have reviewed survey completion rates (the 2019 post-round surveys), data was collected and uploaded from 98% or higher of the number of households that were targeted to be interviewed. This leads us to believe that it is unlikely that substantial data loss occurred after collection.

## Results

We believe that results from Malaria Consortium's coverage surveys provide strong evidence that a high proportion of the target population was reached with SMC in past rounds. We use these coverage estimates, along with data on program spending, to estimate the **cost of delivering SMC to a child**. See **this spreadsheet** for all results we have seen from Malaria Consortium's SMC programs. Results weighted by target population from post-round surveys in 2017-2019 show that across those years, 93% of targeted children received SMC during at least one monthly cycle, 81% during at least two cycles, 70% during at least three cycles, and 56% during all four cycles.87 In the most recent program year, 2019, post-round surveys measured average coverage across cycles at 89% in Burkina Faso, 69% in Chad, and 68% in Nigeria.88

For coverage surveys in 2017-2019, we have compared results from post-cycle and post-round surveys. After converting the two sets of coverage estimates into a measure of total person-months of coverage for comparison, we find a difference of 2% between them for 2017, 13% for 2018, and 24% for 2019.89 The difference in 2018 is driven largely by results from Nigeria and in 2019 by results from Nigeria and Chad. In all three cases, post-cycle results found higher person-months of coverage than post-round results.90

Differences in sampling protocol and questionnaire design between the two types of surveys may inevitably lead to some difference in results. However, the fact that post-cycle and post-round results were similar in Burkina Faso in 2017-19, in Chad in 2017-18, and in Nigeria in 2017 leads us to believe that larger discrepancies cannot be explained merely by methodological differences and likely result from biases present in the surveys in Chad in 2019 and Nigeria in 2018-19. In all three cases, we believe that the post-round results are a better indication of actual coverage91 and have chosen to use these results to estimate the cost of delivering SMC to a child.

## Have malaria rates decreased in targeted populations?

The evidence we have discussed to this point forms the basis of our expectation of the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC programs. In this section, we consider whether there is additional evidence on the impact or efficacy of SMC that either corroborates this expectation or raises concerns that Malaria Consortium's programs are not achieving the impact we expect.

### Sentinel surveillance site data (2013-2016)

We have seen sentinel surveillance site data from Chad, Mali, and Niger for 2013 to 2016 and from Burkina Faso and Nigeria for 2015 to 2016.92 We have received only headline figures for the reduction in malaria cases in children under 5 years old; we have not seen additional information on the sources for or analysis of this data.93 We have therefore not vetted the results (described in the footnote).94 Malaria Consortium told us that the data collected in other ACCESS-SMC countries was of a low quality.

### Health Management Information System (HMIS) data

In 2019, Malaria Consortium conducted an assessment of the impact of SMC on malaria rates in Burkina Faso and Chad from 2013 to 2018 and Nigeria from 2017 to 2018, using national HMIS data.95 This assessment found no evidence of impact.96 Malaria Consortium attributes this result to several factors, in particular the variable and generally low quality and completeness of HMIS data used in the analysis.97

Malaria Consortium notes that it chose to analyze HMIS data, despite the fact that it is typically of low quality, because it is an inexpensive and commonly used source of impact data and therefore a relatively sustainable method for assessing impact over the long term.98 Given our understanding that collecting high-quality health facility data is difficult, we find Malaria Consortium's explanation plausible. Our overall assessment of the expected impact of SMC places little weight on the lack of impact found in HMIS-based impact assessments because:

Non-randomized comparisons between areas in which SMC is implemented and not implemented may over or understate the impact of SMC due to differences in the two groups other than presence of SMC. We believe that there is a risk that data quality limitations will be emphasized more where non-positive trends are found than where positive trends are found. Independently assessing the quality of HMIS data would be a large project for us and we have not prioritized that work. As noted above, we base our expectation of the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC programs on malaria rates on the evidence of effectiveness of SMC at reducing malaria incidence, as measured by RCTs, and evidence from Malaria Consortium's coverage surveys that a high proportion of targeted children have received SMC.

#### Case-control studies

Malaria Consortium also shared case-control studies designed to measure the efficacy of SMC from five ACCESS-SMC countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, and Nigeria. We have not yet vetted the methodology (some details in the footnote), and the dataset from Nigeria did not pass quality control.99 Malaria Consortium's conclusion from these studies is, "These results confirm that SMC treatments are providing a very high degree of personal protection from malaria for a period of 28 days after each treatment. Protection then declines rapidly emphasizing the importance of repeating treatments at monthly intervals."100 More details on those results in this footnote.101

#### Northern Nigeria (2012-2014)

We have seen three types of analyses of the impact of Malaria Consortium's northern Nigeria program on malaria indicators. These results seem to be consistent with the impacts of SMC found in randomized controlled trials of the program, but due to our remaining questions about the studies we do not yet see them as strong _additional_ evidence for the impact of SMC programs. See our **previous review of Malaria Consortium** for more details on this study.

## Are there any negative or offsetting impacts?

In this section, we consider factors that are not accounted for in the above evidence that could offset the impact of Malaria Consortium's SMC programs, either through reducing their effectiveness or contributing to negative outcomes.

### Drug resistance

Mass delivery of SMC medicines could contribute to increased drug resistance of SP and/or AQ.102 In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.103 A follow-up survey was conducted in 2017, following two rounds of SMC.104 We have lightly reviewed a preliminary report from this survey, which reported that between baseline and follow-up, the prevalence of mutations associated with AQ resistance did not increase and that the prevalence of mutations associated with SP resistance did increase.105 It also reported that no samples were collected that contained both mutations associated with AQ resistance and mutations associated with SP resistance.106 We have received the final report from this survey but have not yet reviewed it in depth.107 In our cost-effectiveness model, we make a small downward adjustment in our estimate of SMC's impact to account for the possibility of development of drug resistance.

**Possible "rebound" effects**: There is a potential concern that SMC could reduce the natural development of immunity to malaria. After children turn five years old and are no longer eligible to receive SMC or if SMC programs are interrupted by lack of funding or other problems, children could lack immunity and be more susceptible to malaria, especially if other prevention methods, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), are not used. We have not yet investigated this concern in-depth.108 In our cost-effectiveness model, we make a small downward adjustment in our estimate of SMC's impact to account for the possibility of rebound effects.

**Side effects of SMC drugs**: Our impression is that the most common reaction seen with SMC drugs in earlier programs was vomiting (AQ is bitter and hard to swallow if not crushed into a powder and mixed with water); more recently, AQ has been available as an orange-flavored dispersible.109 Malaria Consortium told us that the incidence of vomiting has decreased with the new dispersible formulation.100 If the child expels the drugs within 30 minutes, they are supposed to be redosed once; we are unsure whether caregivers typically request extra tablets of AQ from CDs when this happens at home to ensure their child gets a full course of SPAQ.11 Our impression is that other side effects from these drugs are rare and include diarrhea, itching, headache, mild abdominal pain, and rash.122 Severe adverse effects associated with SPAQ are rare. A study in Nigeria that followed up with 10,000 SMC recipients one week after receiving SMC resulted in only five reports of severe adverse events, though Malaria Consortium believes there may have been reluctance to report issues.133 Malaria Consortium shared three resources that report very low severe adverse event rates from SMC drugs (available in the following footnote).114 We have lightly reviewed resources on severe adverse event rates from SMC drugs here.115 In our cost-effectiveness model, we make a small downward adjustment in our estimate of SMC's impact to account for the possibility of severe adverse effects.

**Drug quality and dosage**: Malaria Consortium told us that its policy is to only procure products from suppliers that meet WHO guidelines for pre-qualification quality assurance standards,116 and that these products are approved and quality-assured by the governments of countries where Malaria Consortium works.117 We have not yet asked Malaria Consortium for the details of these processes. If there were issues with drug quality or dosage, it could reduce the effectiveness of the intervention and lead to more rapid development of drug resistance.

## What do you get for your dollar?

### Cost per child covered

In order to make program costs comparable across all of our top charities, we aim to estimate the total cost to all actors of supporting a given program. Our estimate of cost per child covered for SMC includes research costs, start-up costs, and costs incurred by actors such as governments. Our estimates rely on coverage survey estimates to approximate the number of people reached. With these assumptions, we estimate that the total cost to achieve the equivalent of four person-months of SMC coverage is about $6.59. Full details in **this spreadsheet**. We start with this total cost figure and apply adjustments in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for cases where we believe the charity's funds have caused other actors to shift funds from a less cost-effective use to a more cost-effective use ("leverage") or from a more cost-effective use to a less cost-effective use ("funging").

## Cost-effectiveness

SMC programs appear to be in the range of cost-effectiveness of our other priority programs. See our most recent cost-effectiveness model for estimates of the cost per life saved through Malaria Consortium-supported SMC programs and how our model compares this outcome with outcomes of other programs.18 Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. For example, our model does not include the short-term impact of non-fatal cases of malaria prevented. It also does not include possible offsetting impacts or other harms.

There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible.

## Is there room for more funding?

We believe that Malaria Consortium could use more funding than it expects to receive to support its SMC work in its current countries of operation (Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo) in 2022-23. In short:

**Available funding:** As of March 2020, Malaria Consortium held $53.5 million in funding available to support its work.  
**Expected funding:** We project that Malaria Consortium will receive an additional $43 million to support its work over the next three years.  
**Spending opportunities:** Malaria Consortium has identified opportunities to spend up to $141.2 million over the next three years.19 In sum, we estimate that Malaria Consortium could use up to an additional $44.7 million to support its work in its current countries of operation (Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo) in 2022-23.

More details and calculations in this spreadsheet. Below, we discuss our approach to assessing Malaria Consortium's room for more funding.

## Our approach

In general, we assess top charities' funding needs over a three-year period.120 We ask top charities to report their ideal budgets over the next three years, along with information about their current available funding and funding pipeline. The difference between a charity's three-year budget and the funding we project that it will have available to support that budget is the charity's room for more funding. For this analysis, we focus on the portion of Malaria Consortium's SMC portfolio that is funded entirely or in part by philanthropic funding, including GiveWell-directed funding. We exclude the portion of Malaria Consortium's SMC portfolio that is funded exclusively by institutional funding.121

## Available funding

As of March 2020, Malaria Consortium held $53.5 million in uncommitted funding available to support future work in 2021-23. This figure represents the $85 million Malaria Consortium had in the bank,122 less the $31.5 million it had already committed to support its SMC portfolio in 2020. More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Available and expected funding."

## Expected funding

We project that Malaria Consortium will receive an additional $43 million to support its work over the next three years. This projection represents our best guess based on past revenue and our understanding of Malaria Consortium's funding pipeline. It excludes any funding we may specifically recommend to Malaria Consortium, beyond the Maximum Impact Fund grant we made in late 2020 and our November 2020 recommendation to Open Philanthropy, both of which are described below.

We include the following sources of funding in our projection:

- **Funding currently held by GiveWell to be granted to Malaria Consortium.** We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.  
- **Funding granted from GiveWell's Maximum Impact Fund.** In late 2020, we granted $3.8 million from our **Maximum Impact Fund** to Malaria Consortium. We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.  
- **Funding recommended by GiveWell to be granted by Open Philanthropy.**123 In November 2020, we recommended that Open Philanthropy grant $27 million to Malaria Consortium to fully support extending its funding runway for its current programs in Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo through 2022, fully support expanding to newly-eligible locations in Nigeria in 2022 and maintaining work in those new areas in 2023, and partially support extending its funding runway for its current programs through 2023. We include this amount in our projection of funding available for the next year.  
- **Projected funding due to being a GiveWell top charity.** GiveWell maintains a list of all charities that meet our criteria, along with a recommendation for which charity or charities to give to in order to maximize the impact of additional donations. Some donors give based on our top charity list but do not follow our recommendation for marginal funding. We estimate the amount that Malaria Consortium will receive from these donors in the next year and include this amount in our projection of funding available for that year only.124

## Spending opportunities

Malaria Consortium has identified opportunities to spend up to $141.2 million to support its work in its current countries of operation (Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo) in 2021-23. This estimate excludes $30.1 million in potential costs of expanding to new countries in 2021-23, which we expect to consider in more detail in the future.28 This estimate is sensitive to Malaria Consortium's best guess of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect its SMC program costs in the next three years; it is possible that the true impact of the pandemic on these costs will differ from what Malaria Consortium has projected. After applying Malaria Consortium's available and expected funding, we estimate that Malaria Consortium could use up to an additional $44.7 million in funding over the next three years. Additional funding would support:

- $43.4 million to maintain its SMC programs in Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo through 2023 at the scale it expects to achieve in 2021.26  
- $1.3 million to expand its SMC program in Chad in 2022 and maintain that expansion in 2023.  

More details and calculations in this spreadsheet, sheet "Spending opportunities."

## Availability of unrestricted funding

Since Malaria Consortium works on a variety of programs, it is possible that receiving additional funds for its SMC work could lead it to reallocate unrestricted funds or other organizational resources (such as time spent fundraising) toward other programs, so that additional dollars donated to Malaria Consortium would not fully support additional SMC work. However, we do not see this as a major concern because we do not believe that Malaria Consortium has substantial unrestricted funding available, and it seems that Malaria Consortium has not allocated substantial unrestricted funding to SMC work in the past (see footnote for details).127

## Global funding landscape

Malaria Consortium's estimate of its room for more funding for SMC makes certain assumptions about what funding will be available globally for SMC from other major institutional funders.
```

```markdown
Historically, major funders of SMC have included the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, PMI, the UK government's Department for International Development, and the World Bank.^28^ Malaria Consortium expects the Global Fund and PMI to continue funding SMC in 2021-23 in the countries where it works (the Global Fund in Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo; PMI in Burkina Faso and Nigeria). Our understanding is that the World Bank will not fund SMC in these countries in the future. We are unsure how much funding for SMC will be available from the UK government.^129^

Malaria Consortium shared the information it had, as of June 2020, about the expected size of funding gaps in 2020 in each of the countries that contain areas eligible for SMC. In short:^130^

A total of 31 million children are eligible for SMC. This estimate includes target population estimates from twelve countries.^131^ Malaria Consortium did not have target population estimates from two countries.^132^

In the twelve countries, Malaria Consortium estimates that 895,000 eligible children will not be covered in 2020, roughly equivalent to a funding gap of $4.4 million in 2020.^133^

This gap is substantially lower than the 9.1 million eligible children that Malaria Consortium estimates were not covered in 2019.^134^ This is due almost entirely to increased coverage in Nigeria. In 2019, Nigeria was by far the largest part of the global funding gap, with 8 million out of 11.7 million eligible children not covered with SMC.^135^ Malaria Consortium estimates that the gap in Nigeria has been reduced to 750,000 in 2020, as a result of increased funding from the Global Fund and PMI and increased GiveWell-directed funding.^136^

Currently, a substantial portion of global funding available for SMC is GiveWell-directed funding of Malaria Consortium's work. We roughly estimate that in 2020, GiveWell-directed funding will constitute 40% of total SMC funding in Burkina Faso, 50% in Chad, and 30% in Nigeria.^137^

2020 is the last year of the current Global Fund three-year funding cycle; Malaria Consortium's estimate of its room for more funding is informed by the information it had available, as of June 2020, about how the Global Fund will allocate funding over the period 2021-23. At a high level, Malaria Consortium expects funding available from the Global Fund for SMC to increase relative to the previous three-year period, at least in the countries where Malaria Consortium works.^138^ This suggests that the proportion of eligible children who are not covered, the majority of whom live in Nigeria, will continue to decrease. On the other hand, revised SMC eligibility criteria may lead to the adoption of a fifth SMC cycle in some areas that implement SMC, expansion of eligibility to new areas within countries that implement SMC, and adoption of SMC by countries that do not currently implement SMC.^139^ Such changes could increase both the total target population eligible for SMC and the average cost per targeted child, thereby increasing the global room for more funding for SMC.

## Malaria Consortium as an organization

We use qualitative assessments of our top charities to inform our funding recommendations. See this page for more information about this process and for our qualitative assessment of Malaria Consortium as an organization.
