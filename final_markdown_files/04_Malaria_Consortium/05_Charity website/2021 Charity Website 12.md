## Evaluation

Evaluation is the systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or completed project at a single point in time (e.g. mid-term or end-line evaluation). The aim is to determine the relevance and fulfilment of objectives, project efficiency, effectiveness, impact and/or sustainability depending on the specific question the evaluation exercise tries to answer. Evaluations may answer the questions of how well the project worked overall, what aspects did not work and why. This allows Malaria Consortium to capture learnings that are then integrated into further project or organizational decision-making. At Malaria Consortium, any learnings captured through specific evaluations are linked to the wider approach to learning that we implement: By capturing and collating knowledge, learning and evidence relating to the focus and effectiveness of our work and sharing these, we hope to provide knowledge on public health development that will help influence and advance both policy and practice.
