### Influencing practices and policy

#### Appropriate decision making

is one of the primary goals of a well-functioning health information system, however, also represents one of most difficult challenges to governments and ministries of health. In order to make informed decisions, it is critical to ensure relevant health information is gathered and evaluated without resulting in delays in decision making. To support this process, Malaria Consortium focuses on ensuring timeliness, simplicity and triangulation of data sources, with a clear data to action framework across all levels of service delivery. By applying these principles and pooling different data sources together, a better understanding of determinants and contributory factors of disease acquisition and transmission is achieved, guiding informed decision making. Malaria Consortium also actively works with key global networks and coalitions involved in surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. We co-chair the BBM Partnership to End Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group whose purpose is to facilitate alignment of partners on strategies and best practices for developing effective systems to monitor and evaluate More malaria control programmes. We also co-chaired the WHO Technical Expert Group on Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation which is trained with reviewing evidence, providing advice and making draft recommendations on surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.
