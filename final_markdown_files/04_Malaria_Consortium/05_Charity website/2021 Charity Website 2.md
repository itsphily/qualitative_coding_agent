#### Intermittent preventive treatment

Intermittent preventive treatment involves the administration of a full course of anti-malarial drugs to vulnerable subjects at specified times regardless of whether or not they have malaria. It is particularly targeted at children and pregnant women in high risk areas. Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy is provided to women in high malaria burden countries during during their pregnancy to protect both them and their unborn child from malaria. Read more about our work on malaria in pregnancy here.

#### Communication and information

Without support and information to raise awareness and understanding of malaria and how to protect themselves, communities will not be able to benefit fully from improved provision of health services and malaria commodities such as LLINs. Social behaviour change or public health communications is an approach that aims to help people gain the awareness, knowledge and ability to participate in their own development and take control of their own wellbeing. In the context of malaria prevention, we use this approach to encourage individuals and communities at risk from the disease to change their perspectives and behaviour as they learn how to control the impact of the disease on their lives, while creating demand for and sustained use of malaria services and products. The disease, the process of its transmission, and the range of preventive measures available are complex. The connection between actions to control malaria and the illness people suffer may not be obvious to those living in malaria-endemic areas. However, without the cooperation of these potential beneficiaries, the success of Roll Back Malaria's Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria 2016-2030 will be limited.
