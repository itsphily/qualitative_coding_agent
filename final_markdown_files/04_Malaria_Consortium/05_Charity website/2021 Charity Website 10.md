### Monitoring

Monitoring is the routine collection and analysis of information over the course of a project. Quality monitoring supports project implementation through tracking of performance against set targets and facilitates evidence-based, adaptive learning through regular feedback mechanisms. At Malaria Consortium, we make sure that all projects are set up with high-quality monitoring systems from the start to ensure effective project management, accountability and compliance with established standards. Our core requirements for monitoring systems and practices are laid out in our M&E policy. Our M&E requirements are aligned with our Malaria Consortium Project Cycle Management approach. This approach integrates the development and review of key M&E documents in the project cycle of all projects and ensures assignment of responsibilities and accountabilities. Take a look at some of our featured projects here.
