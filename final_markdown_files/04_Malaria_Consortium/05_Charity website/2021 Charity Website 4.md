## Elimination

Our engagement in the elimination of malaria, in Asia in particular, has been driven by three major objectives. These are:

* to push for _Plasmodium falciparum_ elimination as quickly as possible in areas of artemisinin resistance
* to establish much better surveillance systems and capacity to provide the detailed, timely information needed for elimination
* to advocate for continued high quality, intense and targeted efforts against malaria even when the burden declines. There are two accepted strategies on how to achieve global malaria eradication - one involves pursuing elimination in low-transmission settings and gradually working 'outwards' towards areas with higher endemicity. The other method entails working in all malaria-endemic areas due to the possibility that malaria can rebound and become re-established in countries or regions declared to be malaria-free. We support the second method and, with an eye to past lessons learnt, we are looking at how practical elimination in Asia and parts of Africa can be achieved. We are supporting the governments of Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia in developing strategies for control and elimination, as well as partnering with the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. Our activities in Southeast Asia to help control the spread of drug resistance have informed global policy and best practice not only for resistance management but also for malaria elimination. Malaria Consortium also works toward control and eventual elimination of a number of neglected tropical diseases (NTDS): onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma and soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, ascariasis and trichuriais), and dengue. We carry out mass drug administration of approved and effective drugs that can be widely supplied to a population to reduce severe morbidity and eventually transmission. Where possible, we also integrate control of NTDs into existing programmes (such as integrated community case management) and health structures. We are supporting the governments of Thailand and Cambodia in developing strategies for elimination as well as partnering with the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. Our drug resistance containment activities in Southeast Asia have informed global policy and best practice not only for containment but also for malaria elimination.
