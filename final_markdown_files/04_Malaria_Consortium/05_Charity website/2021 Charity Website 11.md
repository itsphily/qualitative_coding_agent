### Surveillance

Surveillance is the systematic and ongoing collection, collation, analysis and interpretation of health-related data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken. A key link in the surveillance chain is the application of this data to prevention and control by informing resource allocation, evaluating control and prevention measures, and stimulating disease-related. Malaria Consortium's approach to surveillance is guided by a clear vision of how surveillance can strengthen a health system, particularly on key health system strengthening building blocks such as service delivery, supplies and information. Ongoing surveillance tracks disease incidence and outbreaks and provides information on utilisation of health resources and facilities. This information further informs existing approaches and shares evidence with partners and the community. In addition, integrating surveillance efforts with existing systems further strengthens overall health systems by promoting tools to connect regional, district and central levels of surveillance, and ensuring that surveillance information is linked with the entire health information system. By working closely with national malaria programmes and ministries of health to ensure that surveillance systems are sustainable surveillance efforts contribute to programme ownership and longer term effectiveness and efficiency.

We co-chair the RBM Partnership to End Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group whose purpose is to facilitate alignment of partners on strategies and best practices for developing effective systems to monitor and evaluate M&E malaria control programmes. We also co-chaired the WHO Technical Expert Group on Surveillance, Monitoring and Evaluation which is tasked with reviewing evidence, providing advice and making draft recommendations on surveillance, monitoring and evaluation.
