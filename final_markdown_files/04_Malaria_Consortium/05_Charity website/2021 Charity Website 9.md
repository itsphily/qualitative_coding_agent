The ultimate goal of gathering disease intelligence is to empower decision-makers to lead and manage their programmes more effectively by providing timely, useful health related data through surveillance and/or monitoring and evaluation systems. Increasingly, top managers in ministries of health and finance in developing countries and donor agencies are recognising that data from effective surveillance and monitoring and evaluation systems are useful for targeting resources and evaluating programs.
