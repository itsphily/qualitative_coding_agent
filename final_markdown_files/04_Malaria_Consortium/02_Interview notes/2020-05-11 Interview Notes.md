## Summary

GiveWell spoke with Dr. Tibenderana, Ms. Counihan, Ms. Marasciulo and Dr. Roca of Malaria Consortium as part of its investigation into intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) for malaria. Conversation topics included background on IPTi and the future of IPTi as an intervention.

## Intermittent preventive treatments in infants (IPTi)

Intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) consists of providing an antimalarial medication called sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to infants at each of three routine immunization visits during their first year of life without determining whether or not the infant is infected with malaria. The timeline of the treatments is designed to coincide with the following vaccinations:

* **DPT2 (or PENTA2)** - second inoculation against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (plus hepatitis B and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B for PENTA2), received at ten weeks old.
* **DPT3 (or PENTA3)** - third inoculation against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (plus hepatitis B and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B for PENTA2), received at fourteen weeks old.
* **Measles vaccine** - received at nine months old.

IPTi has been shown to reduce clinical malaria cases in treated children by 30%.

## World Health Organization's recommendation

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been recommending IPTi in areas of sub-Saharan Africa with moderate to high malaria transmission for about 10 years, but adoption of the intervention has been slow. In its initial recommendation, WHO identifies target regions for IPTi using the "annual _Plasmodium falciparum_ entomological inoculation rate" of an area, i.e. the rate at which people are bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes. WHO also initially limited its IPTi recommendation to areas where the prevalence of the marker of parasite resistance to the medication is (â‰¤)50%. This is measured using the prevalence of a specific genetic mutation (_pfdhps_-540E) within the malaria parasite population. Many countries do not have sufficient data to assess their regions on these metrics and have not implemented IPTi as a result. WHO has since released looser guidelines for Global Fund proposals, which give countries more flexibility in interpreting where to implement IPTi. WHO also revised its recommendation to include countries where the presence of the _pfdhps_-540E resistance mutation frequency is less than 90%. This has allowed countries with high or unknown rates of parasite resistance, many of which are located in East Africa, to begin implementing IPTi. Malaria Consortium expects WHO to publish additional guidance to countries regarding malaria chemoprevention in the near future.

### Drug selection

Malaria Consortium's impression is that WHO specifically recommends the use of SP, because this is the medication that was typically used in IPTi efficacy studies and because we have data indicating that it is safe in infants. SP was likely chosen for those studies because it was known to have a stronger and longer-lasting prophylactic effect than other antimalarials, and because it could be combined safely and effectively with vaccines for young children. Using SP alone may also be more cost-effective than using alternative drugs or providing it in combination with another drug, like amodiaquine (AQ). However, many of the efficacy studies on IPTi were conducted more than ten years ago, when parasite resistance to SP was lower and less work had been done on seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), which utilizes a combination of SP with AQ. Malaria Consortium believes the success of SMC has helped open up possibilities for further exploration of alternative antimalarial options like the combination of SP and AQ. Malaria Consortium is aware of multiple studies using other alternative antimalarials for IPTi, but the results are yet to be evaluated. Further research could be done on whether the provision of more expensive antimalarials could be cost-effective in the wake of rising SP-resistance.

### Age restriction for SMC

Like IPTi, SMC is an intervention that involves administering preventive antimalarial medication to young children. SMC is implemented in regions where malaria transmission is highly seasonal, and monthly treatments are only distributed during the rainy season when malaria transmission is high. Data shows that in countries with high malaria transmission, malaria hospitalizations are highest in children under the age of one. Some evidence also suggests that malaria mortality rates are highest among the very youngest infants, but WHO does not recommend SMC for children under the age of three months.

### Maternal antibody protection

One of the reasons WHO doesn't recommend SMC for children under three months old is that, in the past, maternal antibodies were believed to protect children from malaria for roughly the first two months of life. The theory is that in areas with high malaria transmission, adult women have typically developed a degree of immunity to the malaria parasite that is passed down to their children temporarily. For example, the first time Malaria Consortium did a study on congenital malaria, reviewers declined to approve the study because malaria was believed to be uncommon in infants under three months old. However, other malaria prevention interventions have become more widespread over time, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs (which distribute bednets and spray the insides of homes with insecticide, respectively). It may be the case that, as a consequence of these interventions, women are encountering the malaria parasite less often and developing less natural immunity to pass down to their young infants.

### Adverse reactions to SP

WHO's recommendation not to provide SMC to children under three months old may also have been driven by the possibility of adverse reactions to the medication. Because the maternal antibody theory discouraged research on the topic in the past, further research still needs to be done on whether SMC is safe for children under three months old.

### Plans for using additional funding for IPTi

If Malaria Consortium received funding for IPTi, it would likely pursue expanding its work to two or three countries. Another IPTi pilot programme, funded by Unitaid and being implemented by PSI, is getting started; however, waiting for results until the end of the Unitaid-funded programming could be a missed opportunity for countries that could have spent the intervening years scaling up their IPTi programs.

### Promoting government adoption

Malaria Consortium believes that further increasing the scale of implementation and the number of countries involved in pilot programs would increase the likelihood of widespread adoption of the intervention and establishment of national policies for IPTi delivery. For example, some countries are already interested in adopting IPTi at a governmental level, but may be more likely to do so if the intervention has been implemented at scale and evaluated in other countries.

### Scaling up programs

With additional funding, Malaria Consortium would likely utilize a scoring system to select the most suitable countries to implement IPTi, with criteria including: willingness to adopt policy, scalability, prevalence of SP resistance, health system readiness, and presence of SMC. Specifically, Malaria Consortium believes there are additional opportunities for funding scale-up of IPTi through countries' EPI platforms, such as Nigeria, Uganda, Mozambique, Cameroon, and Togo. If IPTi proved to be as cost-effective as SMC, it might be worth examining whether SMC programs should be integrated with other community delivery platforms.

### Furthering research

Malaria Consortium also believes that additional research on the cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of IPTi touchpoints would be valuable. The current IPTi schedule includes a large gap between the ages of 14 weeks and 9 months when no treatment is given, even though a significant portion of malaria morbidity and mortality occur during this period. WHO has suggested that the research demonstrating the effectiveness of SMC treatments at one-month intervals is enough to lend biological plausibility to the idea that IPTi treatments could be given at shorter intervals than currently outlined, without conducting a randomized efficacy survey. Another possible use of additional funding would be increased drug resistance monitoring. The governments of Uganda and Mozambique have already expressed interest in incorporating this monitoring into their systems.

### Future of IPTi

Malaria Consortium believes the success of SMC interventions has demonstrated that chemopreventive tools like IPTi can be effective at scale and has provided a benchmark for achievement. It also believes revised WHO guidelines would open up possibilities for countries to adapt the intervention to their specific contexts, such as in areas with high SP-resistance rates and sub-national implementation alongside SMC. It also expects that WHO guidelines will ultimately be revised to include four or five touchpoints rather than the three currently recommended. Malaria Consortium believes that with further support, IPTi could be implemented and scaled in three or four countries over the next two years.

### Additional potential funding sources for IPTi

Malaria Consortium has received funding from BMGF to do a 4-year pilot study in one state in Ebonyi State in Nigeria. The primary outcome is to provide evidence for IPTi policy adoption in Nigeria.

#### Global Fund

Some countries' proposals for Global Fund grants have included IPTi in their budgets, but have not made it a priority program. Instead, they have tended to craft their budgets such that, if any money from the budget is left over after other activities have been implemented or cancelled, it will be used for IPTi. SMC, by comparison, has been prioritized by the Global Fund.

#### President's Malaria Initiative

Malaria Consortium's donor analyses suggest that short-term funding for IPTi from the President's Malaria Initiative is unlikely but not out of the question.

#### Unicef

UNICEF has stated that some of its funding will go to IPTi through the EPI platform, but it is unlikely that this funding will support implementation at scale.

Malaria Consortium is discussing potential funding for IPTi in Nigeria with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This funding is likely to support an efficacy study, rather than implementation at scale or robust drug resistance monitoring, unless Malaria Consortium receives additional funding that could support a program expansion.
