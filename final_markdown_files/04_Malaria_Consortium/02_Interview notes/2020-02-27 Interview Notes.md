## Summary

GiveWell spoke with Dr. Magumba, Mr. Kyagulanyi, Mr. Muhumuza, and Ms. Marasciulo of Malaria Consortium as part of its review of Malaria Consortium's post-distribution monitoring (PDM) for the 2017-2018 distribution of nets provided by Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) in western and eastern Uganda. Conversation topics included the 2017-2018 net distribution campaign in Uganda, the health and administrative structures of Uganda, actors involved with the PDM, study arms and sampling, data collection procedures, the process of conducting household revisits, and the data entry process.

## 2017-2018 net distribution in Uganda

The Ugandan Ministry of Health has implemented two recent distribution campaigns (one in 2013-2014 and one in 2017-2018) for the universal coverage of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). After the first universal coverage campaign, some improvements were implemented for the 2017-2018 campaign, including the addition of a PDM component in order to gather data on the condition and usage of the nets over time as well as changes in malaria morbidity or mortality. The 2017-2018 universal coverage campaign involved the distribution of about 26.6 million nets in total. About half (12.6 million) of these were provided by AMF. The nets included regular LLINs as well as LLINs with piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The Global Fund also provided nets for the 2017-2018 campaign. The entire distribution campaign lasted for approximately one year, with nets being distributed in several different waves (in part because AMF and Global Fund nets arrived at different times). Wave one, which did not involve AMF nets, covered northern Uganda. AMF nets were distributed in the eastern region in waves two and three, and in the western region in waves 3, 4a, and 4b.

### Ugandan health structure and administrative units

The largest administrative unit in Uganda (below the national level) is the district, and below the district is an administrative unit called a sub-county. Each district in Uganda has a malaria focal person. Health assistants work to implement health interventions at the sub-county level. Each district is also divided into health sub-districts (HSDs)--about two or three HSDs on average. There are approximately four sub-counties per HSD. A sub-county is divided into an average of five parishes, and each parish contains an average of five villages, the smallest geographical administrative unit. On average, a village contains about 200 households. Urban villages may have as many as 500 households, while a rural village may have only 150 households. At the beginning of the 2017-2018 universal coverage campaign, Uganda had 116 districts. Since then, some districts have been subdivided, creating new districts. There are currently 135 districts in total. The area covered by the AMF portion of the universal coverage campaign used to contain 58 districts; it now contains 71 districts. [The target population for the coverage campaign and the AMF portions of that campaign did not change, only the administrative borders.]

### Actors involved with the PDM

AMF is the funding agency for the PDM, providing approximately $1.6 million (USD). It is also responsible for:

* sampling of the HSDs, villages, and households
* providing guidance on the implementation of the PDM
* designing, developing, and maintaining the data entry system (DES)
* data analysis
* writing the final report to the Ugandan Ministry of Health

### Malaria Consortium

Malaria Consortium is coordinating the PDM. It has the following responsibilities:

* monitoring and supervising the implementation of the PDMs by the Church of Uganda and the Programme for Accessible Health Communication and Education (PACE)
* managing data entry
* coordinating household revisits
* writing quarterly progress narratives and financial reports for AMF (the most recent of which were submitted in December 2019)

### Church of Uganda and PACE

The Church of Uganda and PACE are implementing partners for the PDMs. The Church of Uganda is implementing PDMs in the western part of Uganda, and PACE implements PDMs in the eastern part. The primary responsibility of these partners is managing the training of field data supervisors and the cascading of that training to data collectors. The implementing partners are also responsible for the monitoring and supervision of the individuals involved with data collection. They take advantage of the existing health structure in order to implement the PDMs. Personnel involved include district health officers, malaria focal persons, health assistants, and village health team members (VHTs).

### VHTs

The role of VHTs in the Ugandan health structure is to support health interventions at the village level. VHTs perform activities related to health promotion and disease prevention. Among other things, their work may include integrated community case management (iCCM) to diagnose and treat malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malnutrition, as well to promote neonatal and maternal health and family planning. VHTs were selected as data collectors for the PDMs because they have knowledge of their villages (e.g., knowing each household by name) as well as the net distribution campaign (because VHTs distributed the nets during the campaign). Approximately five VHTs operate in each village; among these, district health officials select one to collect data for the PDMs, based on who the district health official believes will best perform the job.

### Study arms

The PDM is anchored on six different arms, which vary based on the sampling rate of households to be visited per HSD as well as the timing of household visits. 60 health sub-districts were randomly allocated to five arms of 12 health sub-districts each, all in the Western region. Four of the arms vary by frequency (6 or 9 months) and sample size (5% or 1.5%) and one arm serves as a control group (with PDMs at 18 and 30 months only, 5% sample size). In the Eastern region, Malaria Consortium also conducted PDMs, beginning 12 months after distribution and then at 6 month intervals with 1.5% sample size. The Eastern region was not part of the trial. A summary of each arm is below:

* **Arm 1:** 5% sampling rate; visits at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months post-distribution
* **Arm 2:** 1.5% sampling rate; visits at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months post-distribution
* **Arm 3:** 5% sampling rate, visits at at 9 and 18 months post-distribution
* **Arm 4:** 1.5% sampling rate, visits at 9 and 18 months post-distribution
* **Arm 5 (Control Arm):** 5% sampling rate, visit at 18 and 30 months post-distribution
* **Arm 6:** 1.5% sampling rate, visits at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months post-distribution

To determine whether there are significant effects of frequency and sample size, AMF will compare the data at the 18 and 30 month points. These are the timepoints at which PDMs were conducted for all arms. Specifically, AMF will compare key indicators of presence, use, and condition for:

* 1.5% vs. 5% HSDs, holding frequency constant
* 6 vs. 9 month HSDs, holding sample size constant
* Control vs. other arms

### Sampling

The sampling of HSDs, villages, and households is done randomly. For each village selected, a core set of 23 households that were beneficiaries in the 2017-2018 universal coverage campaign are randomly selected for visits, and an additional seven are also randomly selected to serve as spares in the event that some of the initial households cannot be found. (In order for a village to be eligible for selection for the PDM, it would need to have at least 30 households.) Using the household registration database from the 2017-2018 universal coverage campaign, AMF generates the lists of selected locations for each round of the PDM. Among other information, the list includes the name of the household head (recorded during net distribution) to make it easier for data collectors to locate the selected households. It also includes unique identifiers for each village and household, which were assigned during the randomization process. This ID remains the same throughout the study. The lists are sent to Malaria Consortium, which reviews them to ensure that they include selections for the correct number of locations to be covered for that round of the PDM, according to Malaria Consortium's data collection schedule. If issues are found, Malaria Consortium seeks clarification from AMF. After the lists are reviewed by Malaria Consortium, they are forwarded to the Church of Uganda and PACE, who are also able to review the lists and report back if issues are found. The Church of Uganda and PACE use these lists to create logistical plans for implementing the PDMs. They need to have the information about the number and locations of HSDs and villages selected so that they can figure out how many days they will need to have data collectors in the field for that PDM and how many field data supervisors they will need. They also cannot develop a schedule for the PDM with district officials until they know which HSDs have been selected. It is possible that the HSDs selected may already have major activities planned during the dates of the PDM, which could create scheduling issues.

### Data collection procedures

#### Training for data collection

The implementing partners use a cascading training model to promote a common understanding of the data collection tool and the purpose of the data collection activities. A "training of trainers" is held for district level health professionals (primarily the malaria focal persons as well as some district health officers). These health professionals then provide training for health assistants (who serve as field data supervisors), and the health assistants later train VHTs (who serve as data collectors). Each field data supervisor oversees 10 data collectors.

#### Household visits

The data collectors use a paper survey form, known as the data collection tool, to record data related to net presence, net condition, and net use. Data collectors are also provided with a list of the sampled households for their selected village. Upon locating a selected household, the first step of the data collection process is for the data collector to gain consent from the head of the household to enter the home and record data for the study. The data collector writes the unique identifier for the household at the top of the data collection tool and asks how many people live in the household. Once inside the home, the data collector identifies the number of sleeping spaces and the number of nets hung in the home.

#### Assessment of nets found hung

For nets found hung only, the data collector physically inspects the nets for holes or tears and records information about them in a data table on the data collection tool. (Nets that are assessed as being worn out are also not included in the data table.) The data collector asks whether each net was provided during the 2017-2018 distribution and also checks for brand labels associated with nets provided by AMF. Data collectors were able to see these labels during their training. If a net is found hung that was not provided by AMF in the 2017-2018 distribution, the condition of the net will still be assessed, but this fact will be noted on the data collection tool. The data collection tool provides guidance for the data collector to mark the nets as "very good", "good", or "just ok" depending on the number and size of holes in the net. For example, a net that has two or fewer holes that are two centimeters wide or less would be marked as being in very good condition.

During their training, the data collectors learn and practice methods to measure holes in the nets using their index finger and fist as measuring tools. For example, if the data collector can put their index finger through a hole in the net, that hole is larger than two centimeters, so the net is not in "very good" condition. A net with any hole that can allow a fist through it is in worn out condition. The data collector also asks the head of the household how many people slept under each net the previous night within each of the following categories: children 5-years-old or younger, children between the ages of 6 and 18, pregnant women, and other adults.

#### Accounting for nets received

The data collector asks the head of the household how many nets were originally received during the 2017-2018 net distribution. The data collector also asks the head of the household whether there are additional nets present in the home that are not hung, and if so, will ask about why the nets are not hung and record the reason. Nets may have been taken down because they were worn out, so there is a space on the form to record the number of nets worn out as well. If fewer AMF nets are present in the home than the number of nets that the head of household reported having received during the 2017-2018 distribution, the data collector will ask about what happened to the missing nets and record the reason in the data collection tool.

#### Other data collected

The data collector also records on the data collection tool whether the household understands how to properly hang and use the nets. They do this by assessing the way that the nets are hung and--if it is unclear how the nets are used by the way they are hung at that particular time--by asking the household head to demonstrate how the household uses the net at night. Finally, the data collector asks whether anyone living in the household has been diagnosed with malaria in the past month. The household does not need to produce evidence of the diagnosis.

#### Data quality assurance during data collection

The implementing partners (the Church of Uganda and PACE) manage supervision teams that monitor the data collection activities. Field data supervisors conduct spot checks of household visits and also review a sample of the VHTs' data collection tool forms to see if data is properly entered in the various fields and to look for inconsistencies. They use various spot check or monitoring tools.

#### Use of spare households

In instances where one or more of the 23 households initially selected for data collection are unavailable, the VHT will visit spare households to reach a total of 23 households visited. A list of seven spares is provided for each village. If a data collector is not able to reach a household, they will record the reason in the data collection form for that household. Then, before moving on to collect data from a spare household, they must visit a local leader to obtain a letter confirming the reason that they have offered. For instance, the local leader may confirm that the household has moved and is no longer living in the village. This step was decided upon by Malaria Consortium and the implementing partners and is meant to ensure that data collectors do not falsely claim that a household cannot be reached.

The data collectors in urban settings tend to use the spares more often than those in rural areas, since households in urban areas are more likely to have rented their homes and thus to have moved between net distribution and the PDM. In some instances, data collectors have not been able to reach 23 of the listed 30 households. Some data collectors have requested that a larger number of spares be provided. However, it is rare that so many households are unable to be found. Most VHTs are able to reach the target of 23 households with the sample list of 23 core households and 7 spares.

### Household revisits

To assess the quality of data collection, 5% of the households visited are sampled again. Malaria Consortium, rather than the Church of Uganda or PACE, is responsible for overseeing the revisits. Within seven days of the submission of the initial data for a particular PDM, AMF generates lists of households to be revisited for each village selected for resampling. Twelve households are randomly selected for each village, and no spares are provided. AMF then sends the lists to Malaria Consortium. As with the initial sample of households, Malaria Consortium reviews the lists, then sends them on to the malaria focal persons, who serve as coordinators for the revisits. The health assistants, who typically serve as field data supervisors during the main activity, are the data collectors for this activity. The procedures for data collection for the revisits are the same as those for the initial visits. The only difference is that the data collection tools are marked with a 105% label to indicate that they are part of the revisit process. After the revisits occur, the households' unique identifiers are used to compare the data from the original or initial visit with that of the revisit. It would be difficult for health assistants to fraudulently match the data from the revisits and original visit because:
* The health assistants each manage 10 data collectors who visit 23 households each, resulting in a large number of data collection tools.
* The health assistants do not know which villages or households will be selected for revisits.
* Household revisits do not occur until after the initial data collection for that PDM is complete and the data collection tools have been submitted to the partners.

It is possible that a household which was not originally visited is visited during this round of data collection. If a household was not home during the initial visit and a spare was used instead, that household might still end up on the list for revisits.

### Data entry

After VHTs submit their data to the Church of Uganda and PACE, the data is brought to Malaria Consortium's PDM data center where computers and an internet connection for data entry are provided and the data collection tools are stored. Upon receiving the data, Malaria Consortium runs a quick check to verify that all of the appropriate data has been submitted from each of the HSDs. Malaria Consortium also organizes the data for entry. Malaria Consortium has two data entry supervisors, two record clerks, and 21 data entrants. Data entrants are paid per entry and are responsible for entering data on 250 households. Malaria Consortium arrived at this target because it is a comfortable figure that would allow for quality data entry. The DES has built-in validation mechanisms to increase the likelihood of accurate data entry. For example, the household ID contains 8 digits, so if a data entrant enters only 7 digits in that field, the system will raise a flag letting the data entrant know that the field is incomplete. The same thing would happen if the data entrant accidentally input letters in the phone number field. After a data entrant finishes entering data for their 250 households, 13 households (5%) are randomly selected by a different data entrant to be reentered by that data entrant. The data entry supervisor can then compare the data entered by the first and second data entrants for these 13 households, identify mismatches, and compare against the original data collection tool to correct mistakes. A report is generated that shows the rate of mismatched data for the re-entered households--both in total and for individual data entrants. If patterns of mistakes emerge for a particular data entrant, the data entry supervisor can take steps to correct that. Currently, for the data center as a whole, 95.6% of the re-entered data matches the original data.
