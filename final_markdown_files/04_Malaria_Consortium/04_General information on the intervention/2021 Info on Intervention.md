Seasonal Malaria

Chemoprevention

Summary

What is the program? Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) involves giving children under the age of 5 full malaria treatment courses intermittently during the malaria season. In general, we focus our discussion on work similar to that of Malaria Consortium's SMC program (one of our top charities). What is its evidence of effectiveness? Seven randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence that this program reduces cases of malaria in the treated population. The trials were insufficiently powered to detect effects on all-cause mortality. One randomized controlled trial provides evidence we find compelling that SMC also reduces cases of malaria incidence in the untreated population. How cost-effective is it? SMC programs appear to be in the range of cost-effectiveness of our other priority programs. Does it have room for more funding? It appears that there is a large remaining global need for additional funding for SMC programs.

What is the problem? Malaria is one of the leading causes of child deaths in Africa.1 It is transmitted from person to person by infected mosquitoes.2 It involves flu-like symptoms including fever.3 As discussed below, there is evidence connecting malaria with death (particularly in children under 5), anemia, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), other nutrition-deficiency-related indicators, and low birthweight. It is also believed that malaria can cause permanent disability (hearing impairment, visual impairment, epilepsy, etc. ).4

## What is the program?

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines seasonal malaria chemoprevention as "the intermittent administration of full treatment courses of an antimalarial medicine to children during the malaria season in areas of highly seasonal transmission. "5 It "consists of administering a maximum of four treatment courses of SP [sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine] + AQ [amodiaquine] at monthly intervals to children aged 3-59 months in areas of highly seasonal malaria transmission"6 and "during the high malaria transmission period. "7 SMC was "formerly known as 'intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in children [IPTc]. "8

According to the World Health Organization (WHO):

The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas:
where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months;
where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season);
where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.9

According to the WHO, "SMC provides protection for up to 1 month after each complete (3-day) course... Health workers should give the dose of SP and the first dose of AQ to the children under their direct observation and should advise the children's caregivers on how to give the second and third doses of AQ to the child at home. "10

Does the program have strong evidence of effectiveness? Seven randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence that this program reduces cases of malaria. A 2012 Cochrane Collaboration review concluded, "In areas with seasonal malaria transmission, giving antimalarial drugs to preschool children (age [less than] 6 years) as IPTc during the malaria transmission season markedly reduces episodes of clinical malaria, including severe malaria. This benefit occurs even in areas where insecticide treated net usage is high. "11 The trials were insufficiently powered to detect effects on all-cause mortality.

## Evidence from randomized controlled trials

The Cochrane review summarizes the results of seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It states:

Seven trials (12,589 participants), including one cluster-randomized trial, met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in West Africa, and six of seven trials were restricted to children aged less than 5 years. IPTc prevents approximately three quarters of all clinical malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.26; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.38; 9321 participants, six trials, high quality evidence), and a similar proportion of severe malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76; 5964 participants, two trials, high quality evidence). These effects remain present even where insecticide treated net (ITN) usage is high (two trials, 5964 participants, high quality evidence). IPTc probably produces a small reduction in all-cause mortality consistent with the effect on severe malaria, but the trials were underpowered to reach statistical significance (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.39, moderate quality evidence). The effect on anaemia varied between studies, but the

risk of moderately severe anaemia is probably lower with IPTc (risk ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 8805 participants, five trials, moderate quality evidence). Serious drug-related adverse events, if they occur, are probably rare, with none reported in the six trials (9533 participants, six trials, moderate quality evidence). Amodiaquine plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is the most studied drug combination for seasonal chemoprevention. Although effective, it causes increased vomiting in this age-group (risk ratio 2.78, 95% CI 2.31 to 3.35; two trials, 3544 participants, high quality evidence). When antimalarial IPTc was stopped, no rebound increase in malaria was observed in the three trials which continued follow-up for one season after IPTc.12

We have applied two adjustments to the results of the Cochrane meta-analysis on clinical malaria incidence:

We identified two additional RCTs (Tagbor et al. 2016, Matalinga et al. 2015) published after the Cochrane review, which compare SMC with placebo. Both found smaller effect sizes on incidence of clinical malaria than the pooled results of the Cochrane meta-analysis.13 We added Tagbor et al. 2016 to our updated version of the Cochrane meta-analysis, but did not add Matalinga et al. 2015 because courses were delivered at three monthly (rather than one monthly) intervals, and so are unlikely to have achieved similar reductions in malaria incidence to Malaria Consortium's SMC program.14

One of the RCTs (Dicko et al. 2008) included in the meta-analysis treated participants every eight weeks (rather than monthly, as in the Malaria Consortium program). We have removed this study from the meta-analysis.15

After these two adjustments, the pooled estimate of the effect of SMC on clinical malaria episodes increases slightly (rate ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.37).16

A World Health Organization report claims that SMC offers a high level of protection for about four weeks after the last treatment, after which protection

appears to decline.17 We have not independently vetted this claim. We note that some of the trials continued to collect malaria incidence up to six weeks after the last treatment was administered, which could underestimate the level of protection over a four week period. We have not included an adjustment to account for this underestimate because the trials do not report sufficiently granular data to separately estimate protective efficacy for the period up to four weeks after the last treatment.18

The Cochrane review also notes there is substantial heterogeneity between the program results, meaning the variance between results of different trials is unlikely to have occurred by chance.19 The authors note there are insufficient trials to make meaningful conclusions about the causes of this heterogeneity.20 We reviewed two of the studies which find substantially lower reductions in malaria incidence (Dicko et al. 2008; Tagbor et al. 2016), and note possible causes in this footnote.21

## How does the Malaria Consortium SMC program compare to the programs addressed in these studies?

We examined the individual studies included in the Cochrane review to better understand how they compared to the Malaria Consortium SMC program (one of our top charities). We found:

Six of the seven trials delivered treatment on a monthly basis, as in Malaria Consortium's program.22

Four of the seven trials treated children with a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ), as in Malaria Consortium's program.23

All seven trials were conducted in West Africa, where Malaria Consortium operates.24

Six of the seven trials only treated children under 59 months of age, as in Malaria Consortium's program.25

The number of courses ranged between two and five. Malaria Consortium typically delivers four courses.26

Coverage of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) varied widely between <5% and 93%.27

Weighted average coverage of SMC was ~90%, higher than our estimate of Malaria Consortium's coverage.28

We conclude that the trials in the Cochrane review are reasonably similar to Malaria Consortium's SMC program. We have included an adjustment in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for differences in coverage between the RCTs and Malaria Consortium's program.29

## Does the reduction in malaria incidence cause a similar reduction in mortality?

The trials included in the Cochrane review were underpowered to detect a significant effect on all-cause mortality.30

Our best guess is that the reduction in malaria incidence results in a similar reduction in mortality. We have limited evidence to support this claim but note that:

We would expect that a reduction in clinical malaria from SMC results in a similar reduction in malaria mortality unless there was evidence that SMC was disproportionately likely to prevent non-severe cases of malaria.

The Cochrane review finds that SMC prevents a similar proportion of severe malaria episodes and all clinical malaria episodes, though only two trials measured effects on severe malaria.31

The Cochrane review notes that "IPTc probably produces a small reduction in all-cause mortality consistent with the effect on severe malaria, but the trials were underpowered to reach statistical significance (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.39, moderate quality evidence). "32

We have included an optional downward adjustment (which some contributors use) in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for the possibility that SMC causes a smaller reduction in malaria mortality than malaria incidence.33

## Evidence of implementation at scale

We haven't seen rigorous evaluations of SMC's impact on mortality at large scale. However, we discuss implementation of SMC at scale and the coverage achieved by such programs in our Malaria Consortium review.

### Indirect effects on the untreated population

Treating children with seasonal malaria chemoprevention may disrupt malaria transmission, reducing incidence of malaria in the wider (untreated) population. One RCT (Cisse et al. 2016) estimates protection to the untreated population. We place weight on this study because it appears to be a high-quality study with a large number of participants.34

We discuss Cisse et al. 2016 below.

### Study design and intervention

Cisse et al. 2016 is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial of SMC delivered to children aged between 3 months and 10 years in Senegal between 2008 and 2010.35 The intervention was similar to the program implemented by Malaria Consortium, involving monthly treatment of children with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ) during the high-transmission season.36 However there were also substantial differences between this intervention and Malaria Consortium programs, such as that it treated children over 5 years old. Below, we discuss how we adjust for such differences when applying these results to Malaria Consortium programs.

## Results

The trial found a 60% reduction (95% CI 55%-67%) in malaria incidence (measured by rapid diagnostic test) in children living in areas which received SMC in a particular year, relative to children living in areas not receiving SMC that year.37 Malaria incidence amongst the untreated population (over the age of 10) was 26% lower (95% CI 18%-33%) in areas where SMC was delivered compared to controls.38 The study did not detect an effect on all-cause mortality.39 It was initially designed to have sufficient power to detect a decline in all-cause mortality,40 but mortality was lower than expected in both the treatment and control areas.41

## Conclusion

Overall, we take Cisse et al. 2016 as providing some evidence that SMC reduces incidence of malaria in the untreated population. In order to apply the findings from Cisse et al. 2016 to Malaria Consortium programs, we adjust for major differences between Cisse et al. 2016's intervention and context versus Malaria Consortium's. Two factors make us believe that the indirect effects in Malaria Consortium programs are likely to be about a third as large as Cisse et al. 2016:42

The typical Malaria Consortium program treats children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years old (rather than children aged 3 months to 10 years, as in Cisse et al. 2016). We expect that since a smaller proportion of the population is directly treated in Malaria Consortium-supported contexts, there would also be smaller effects on the untreated population. We asked a malaria researcher how they would adjust for this factor and adopted their assumptions, which are based on an unpublished model. We have not vetted this model and our understanding is that it has been tested against limited empirical data, but it represents our current best guess.43

Our understanding from a conversation with a malaria researcher is that **Cisse**_et al._2016 was conducted in an area of Senegal with lower malaria transmission intensity than the typical Malaria Consortium program, and this would lead to somewhat smaller indirect effects in Malaria Consortium's program. To adjust for this factor, we relied on the aforementioned model that we have not vetted.44

## Possible developmental effects

Reducing exposure to malaria during childhood may have an effect on long term productivity and earnings, although we are uncertain about the magnitude of this effect. We have reviewed the evidence for the developmental effects of malaria prevention here.

## Possible negative / offsetting impacts

Possible development of drug resistance. Resistance to Amodiaquine (AQ), and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) may reduce the effectiveness of SMC over time. We spoke with Professor Sir Brian Greenwood (Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine) about timelines for possible development of drug resistance. He told us:

Timelines are uncertain, but he believes based on historical experience that resistance to AQ/SP is unlikely to develop in the next 5-10 years.45

Some resistance to SP may have emerged in East Africa46, but AQ has relatively little history of resistance.47

If resistance to SP/AQ did develop, dihydroartemisinin-pipearquine (DHAPQ) may be a viable alternative, although we have not carefully reviewed the evidence for DHAPQ.48

We have not vetted these claims but they are consistent with our general impressions from reviewing relevant literature.

### Possible rebound effects. 

One potential issue with SMC is the possibility of disease rebound after treatment ends. We have not investigated this possibility in depth, but note that the Cochrane review includes three RCTs with post-intervention follow-up, none of which find evidence of a rebound effect.49 We are not aware of any studies done to measure rebound effects after multiple years of treatment.50

### Possible interaction with insecticide treated nets (ITNs). 

Two of the RCTs in the Cochrane review promoted the use of ITNs to both the intervention and control group.51 These trials found similar _proportional_ reductions in malaria incidence to trials which did not promote ITNs.52 If SMC and ITN coverage are expanded in the same area at the same time, it is possible that the _absolute_ reduction in malaria incidence attributable to each would be reduced. We have not carefully considered whether Malaria Consortium's SMC program is operating in areas where ITN coverage is being expanded.

### Possible serious adverse events. 

We lightly reviewed two large studies that tracked adverse events in recent SMC distributions in sub-Saharan Africa. We did not deeply vet these studies' methodologies, but they seemed to implement reasonable universal surveillance systems and found very low rates of serious adverse events and no deaths that were clearly attributable to SMC. We did a back-of-the-envelope calculation using very pessimistic assumptions that suggests severe adverse events from SMC are very small in comparison to the magnitude of the benefits. More details in this document. We discuss possible minor side effects of treatment here.

## How cost-effective is the program?

SMC programs appear to be in the range of cost-effectiveness of our other priority programs. See our most recent cost-effectiveness model for estimates of the cost per life saved through Malaria Consortium-supported SMC programs. See our Malaria Consortium review for more details on the cost-per-treatment for SMC. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. For example, our model does not include the short-term impact of non-fatal cases of malaria prevented. It also does not include possible offsetting impacts or other harms.53

There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible.

## Does the program appear to have room for more funding?

For information on the global need for treatment and other potential funders of this program, see this section of our Malaria Consortium review.

## 2016

In 2016 we completed an interim intervention report on SMC. We reviewed the Cochrane Collaboration review (discussed above), the ACCESS-SMC website, the section of the WHO website devoted to SMC, and some documents provided to us by Malaria Consortium.

## 2017

We investigated a small number of high-priority research questions based on our impression of the likelihood that they could substantively change our view of SMC:

We reviewed the individual studies in the Cochrane Collaboration review and removed one (Dicko et al. 2008) because it delivered treatments bi-monthly rather than monthly. We searched for additional RCTs published after the Cochrane Collaboration review and added one (Tagbor et al. 2016) to the meta-analysis. We investigated possible **negative / offsetting impacts** including (i) possible emergence of drug resistance, (ii) possible interaction with ITNs, (iii) rebound effects. We updated our coverage adjustment to account for imperfect coverage in the trials in the Cochrane Collaborate review. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity in the effects of SMC, which we will use to inform our questions for potential top charities.

## 2018

We prioritized reviewing research in two areas that we believed were most likely to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis:

We reviewed a new trial (Cisse et al. 2016), which found reductions in malaria incidence in the untreated population and discussed how to extrapolate from the trial to the Malaria Consortium program with two malaria researchers (more **here**). This work led to a moderate positive update. We reviewed the literature on the long run economic impact of preventing malaria. We have not yet published our conclusions from this work. We also considered using sub-national (rather than country-level) estimates of malaria prevalence to improve the precision of our cost-effectiveness analysis. We decided not to incorporate these adjustments into our model, because we believed the effect on the bottom line was insufficient to justify the additional complexity. See this blog post for more details.
