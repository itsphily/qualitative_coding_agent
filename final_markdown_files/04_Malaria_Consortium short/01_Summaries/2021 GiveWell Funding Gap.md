# Malaria Consortium -- LLIN Funding Gap Scoping

###### Abstract

In June 2020, Malaria Consortium received a GiveWell Incubation Grant of $44,688 to explore whether there are funding gaps for long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) campaigns in areas where Malaria Consortium has existing operations and would be well-positioned to implement LLIN campaigns. Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program is a GiveWell **top charity**, and GiveWell has directed funding to LLIN campaigns in areas with high malaria rates for many years, based on the strong cost-effectiveness of this program.1 This grant is part of our investigation into whether there are additional opportunities to fund LLIN campaigns that we have not yet identified.

## The intervention

Long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) distributions are intended to reduce the burden of malaria by distributing free LLINs to households in areas with high malaria transmission. LLINs are designed to be hung over beds to prevent malaria-carrying mosquitoes from infecting people while they sleep. Mass LLIN distributions have been shown to reduce child mortality from malaria and are one of the most cost-effective interventions we've identified for saving lives. See our intervention report on mass distribution of LLINs for more detail.

## The organization

Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program is a GiveWell **top charity**. Based on its work on SMC, we believe the organization has a strong track record of implementing large-scale malaria prevention programs.2

## Planned activities

The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.3

Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.4 We expected this work to take place from May 2020 through June 2020.5 (Malaria Consortium sent us reports about completed grant activities for Uganda in July 2020 and for Nigeria in September 2020.)

## Case for the grant

We decided to recommend this grant for the following reasons:

* Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities. Mass LLIN distributions are one of the most cost-effective interventions we've identified for saving lives. Nigeria, Uganda, and Mozambique have high rates of malaria transmission.6 Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.7 Additionally, we believed it was possible that the COVID-19 pandemic would divert resources away from malaria prevention efforts at a time when they may have been more needed (if COVID-19 caused disruptions in malaria treatment). Based on these considerations, we believed it was possible that the funding opportunities identified as a result of this grant would be within the range of cost-effectiveness of our top charities. **The funding opportunities found could be more time-sensitive than our other funding opportunities.** We believe it is plausible that funding directed toward these gaps will be used sooner than if we directed it to Malaria Consortium's SMC program or to the **Against Malaria Foundation** instead, which we believe are the most likely alternative uses of this funding.8

**Malaria Consortium has a track record of delivering a high-quality, large-scale malaria prevention program, and we have thoroughly vetted that track record. Based on our knowledge of Malaria Consortium's past work on SMC and the conversations we've had with Malaria Consortium about potentially funding its LLIN distribution work in the future, we have somewhat high confidence in Malaria Consortium's ability to conduct mass LLIN distributions effectively. We believed the grant could make Malaria Consortium more likely to prioritize this work.** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.

## Our process

We had several conversations with Malaria Consortium about potentially funding its mass LLIN distributions. Malaria Consortium then sent us a concept note describing its proposed activities for this grant.
