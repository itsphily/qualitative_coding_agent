## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes for different locations by restructuring roles to reduce fraud risks in Uganda. The calibration of tasks based on contextual differences (smaller network versus an established system in Kenya) suggests a method to improve efficiency and potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment tailored to the local context, where the choice of mobile money provider is based on the scalability of agent networks. Such a calibration of the intervention to local infrastructure constraints is likely to contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring smoother, more flexible transfer processes.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that different calibration strategies in unique local conditions lead to varying levels of operational efficiency. The greater efficiency in Kenya implies that tailoring interventions to local contexts can directly influence cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process where GiveDirectly calibrates the value of its cash transfers in response to local economic conditions—specifically, adjusting for inflation in Kenya. By indexing transfer amounts to inflation, the organization ensures that the real value of the transfers remains consistent despite rising operational costs, thereby supporting its cost-effectiveness standards.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its targeting criteria to fit local conditions. By calibrating its eligibility metrics—shifting away from a thatched roof proxy in areas where it is not common—the organization tailors its intervention to ensure that cash transfers reach the intended beneficiaries, a process that can contribute to improved cost-effectiveness through more efficient allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is actively revising its operational protocols – an example of calibrating the intervention – which may be aimed at better aligning their processes with local conditions. Although it does not explicitly link these changes to cost effectiveness, the modification in targeting criteria suggests an effort to fine-tune the intervention for improved efficiency.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a location-specific operational adjustment made in response to issues observed during the Uganda pilot campaign. By physically separating the call center from field operations, GiveDirectly is calibrating its processes to local organizational and geographic conditions, which can help reduce risks (such as fraud) and potentially contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its cash transfer distribution process based on local conditions—in this case, the lack of mobile-payment infrastructure. By calibrating the intervention with tailored methods, the charity aims to lower operational costs, directly addressing the research question on improving cost effectiveness through local adaptation.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational decision where the charity shifts its allocation of resources based on differing local regulatory and operational conditions. By calibrating its intervention to the unique political landscape in each country, GiveDirectly is likely aiming to maintain or enhance cost effectiveness by investing in more favorable environments.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its enrollment and targeting processes to local conditions—using different criteria in Kenya compared to Uganda based on local feedback. Such calibration is intended to better match the intervention to community needs, which can in turn improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links operational decisions—specifically choosing to deepen interventions in familiar locations rather than expanding into new ones—with cost effectiveness. It indicates that by calibrating their intervention to countries where they already have optimized operations, GiveDirectly minimizes setup costs and leverages existing local insights, thereby enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to local context—in this case, Rwanda's tightly regulated environment—to ensure smooth implementation. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly cited, the efficient registration and expedited hiring resulting from this calibrated approach imply lower operational barriers and potential cost savings, thereby indirectly contributing to cost efficiency.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly deliberately collected pre-intervention baseline data, which is a form of detailed pre-intervention data collection. Although it does not explicitly state how the data informed the identification or implementation of operational processes, the decision to delay enrollment for baseline surveys implies a systematic approach to understanding conditions before intervention—a practice that can contribute to more cost-effective program design and operational decision-making.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates that GiveDirectly collects pre-intervention baseline data (via a survey) before initiating transfers. The need to delay interventions for baseline data collection reflects an operational process that prioritizes data integrity, which ultimately supports cost-effective implementation by ensuring that subsequent actions (like randomization) are based on accurate, pre-intervention data.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly uses detailed pre-intervention data (the GE study baseline data) to evaluate and refine eligibility criteria. By testing and validating these metrics before intervention, the charity is better able to design operational processes that target the most needy households efficiently, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected qualitative, pre-intervention data (via focus groups) to inform the development of new targeting criteria. By incorporating detailed feedback on local vulnerabilities before fully testing the criteria, GiveDirectly is able to adjust its operational processes, potentially contributing to more cost-effective program implementation.
