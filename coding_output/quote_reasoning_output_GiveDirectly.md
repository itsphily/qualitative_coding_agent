## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.

GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational process where GiveDirectly calibrates the amount of its cash transfers to reflect local economic conditions (in this case, inflation in Kenya). By adjusting transfer sizes based on regular, location-specific inflation assessments, the organization works to preserve its efficiency gains and maintain cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process of calibrating eligibility criteria to fit local conditions. By adapting the proxy means test to the specific characteristics of each location (for example, using alternatives in Homa Bay County where thatched roofs are uncommon), GiveDirectly enhances its targeting accuracy, which can reduce misallocation of resources and thereby contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly tailors its operational budgeting and staffing processes to local cost structures. By calibrating efficiency targets based on country-specific data, the organization ensures that its interventions remain cost-effective, with spending tuned to the needs and economic realities of each location.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes to local infrastructural conditions, specifically addressing regions with limited mobile-payment infrastructure. By leveraging existing local agents and community members instead of investing in new infrastructure, the process is calibrated to local needs and has the potential to enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides an example of operational calibration where the intervention is streamlined—reducing the frequency of interactions and eliminating a process step—to lower costs. Although it is not explicitly tied to location-specific needs, it demonstrates the broader strategy of adjusting operational processes to improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adapts its targeting criteria based on localized feedback, thus calibrating its intervention to address the specific needs of a community. While the direct link to cost effectiveness is not explicitly stated, better tailored targeting may enhance resource allocation efficiency and reduce unnecessary expenditures.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.

- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly deliberately collected pre-intervention baseline data before full enrollment, which is a strategy to obtain essential contextual information. Although it does not explicitly state a link to cost effectiveness, such baseline surveys can inform later operational decisions and adjustments, potentially enabling the charity to optimize resource allocation and improve overall cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that collecting pre-intervention baseline data (via a survey conducted prior to token transfers) is integral to preserving the study’s randomization and research integrity. By delaying the intervention until after the baseline data is collected, GiveDirectly adapts its operational timeline, a process that indirectly supports cost-effectiveness through ensuring that the intervention’s impact can be accurately measured and resources effectively allocated.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention qualitative data (through focus groups) to inform and refine its targeting criteria. By obtaining feedback before full implementation, the organization can adjust its operational processes to ensure better targeting, which is a key factor in achieving cost effectiveness in their interventions.
