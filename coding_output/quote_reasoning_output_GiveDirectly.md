## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational process based on local service availability. By switching from EZEE Money to MTN Mobile Money in response to a limited agent network, the organization tailors its intervention to local conditions, which can enhance cost effectiveness through improved efficiency and flexibility.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement directly compares the efficiency of operations in different locations, implying that tailored operational strategies contribute to overall cost effectiveness. It suggests that adapting the intervention strategy to match local characteristics (as seen in Kenya versus Uganda) has a measurable impact on efficiency.

- **Quote:** * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational change made in Uganda, modeled on an already efficient system in Kenya. The separation of roles based on location-specific conditions reduces risks such as fraud, and thereby can lower costs and improve overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy to address local economic conditions—in this case, adjusting transfer sizes in response to inflation in Kenya. By indexing transfer amounts to account for rising local costs, the organization ensures that recipients continue to receive transfers of appropriate real value, which in turn helps maintain overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly modifies its targeting criteria to align with the unique characteristics of a location. By recognizing that traditional indicators (like thatched roofs) may not apply uniformly across different areas, the organization adapts its eligibility assessment to more accurately identify extreme poverty, which can improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of resource allocation.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adaptation in Uganda, where GiveDirectly is experimenting with a distributed cashout model in response to local infrastructural and mobile network conditions. By refining its cash distribution methods based on the local context, the organization is working to improve operational efficiency—which can contribute to overall cost-effectiveness—by potentially reducing logistical challenges and associated costs.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy—altering protocols and targeting criteria—to better fit the local context. Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, such tailored adaptations can help reduce inefficiencies and fraud, thereby potentially enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational adjustment is a location-specific change that leverages the geographic setup of the organization. By relocating the call center to a different location from the field staff, GiveDirectly likely aims to improve oversight and reduce conflicts or fraud, which can contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly incorporates local community resources into its operational process, adapting to local language and trust dynamics. Such a localized monitoring approach helps ensure that the intervention is properly executed, potentially reducing losses from errors or fraud and thereby supporting overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to address local infrastructural limitations. By choosing alternative cash transfer methods in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, the organization potentially avoids the costs of building its own system, indirectly contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides clear evidence of an operational modification aimed at reducing costs. Streamlining the process by reducing interaction frequency and eliminating a redundant verification step directly links operational adaptation to lower administrative costs and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy based on local conditions—in this case, by developing new targeting criteria for Homa Bay based on community feedback. Although it does not explicitly mention cost savings, adapting the strategy to local demographics can improve resource allocation efficiency and thereby contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapted its operational processes to the specific regulatory and capacity-building environment in Rwanda. By tailoring team recruitment and registration processes to the local context, the organization likely improves efficiency, which is a key factor in enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a strategic decision based on local characteristics. By focusing resources where there is an existing capacity and a large need, GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy to maximize cost efficiency, thereby contributing to the organization’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly is implementing location-specific experimental processes to determine the most effective intervention strategies. Tailoring experiments to Rwanda’s context can help identify the most cost-effective approach, thereby informing operational adaptations that boost overall efficiency.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly demonstrates that GiveDirectly altered its operational process—by slowing enrollment—to collect pre-intervention baseline data for the GE study. This action indicates that collecting such data is integral to informing their operations and potentially enhancing cost effectiveness by ensuring interventions are implemented with robust, pre-collected data.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of how pre-intervention data (the baseline survey required before token transfers) shapes operational processes. The need to complete the baseline before implementing the intervention forced GiveDirectly to delay transfers—a decision that balances research integrity with program delivery. Although the text does not explicitly discuss cost-effectiveness, ensuring valid randomization and robust data collection is integral to making efficient, evidence-based operational decisions that ultimately support the charity's overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly engaged in pre-intervention data collection via focus groups to gather community feedback. The insights derived—such as emphasizing the vulnerability of widows—were used to shape the operational targeting criteria for their cash transfer programs, a process that can contribute to more cost-effective charitable interventions.
