## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment made by GiveDirectly that leverages location-specific factors. By relocating certain functions to a different geographic area (Kampala versus field locations), the organization enhances its fraud prevention and operational efficiency, which are key steps toward cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusted its intervention by choosing a payment provider that better aligns with local infrastructure realities. By opting for MTN Mobile Money with a broader network, the organization is tailoring its operations based on location-specific factors, likely reducing logistical bottlenecks and increasing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its cash transfer amounts in Kenya in response to a location-specific factor (significant inflation). By indexing transfer amounts to inflation, GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to maintain the real value of the transfers, which contributes to ensuring cost effectiveness in its charitable interventions.

- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention criteria based on local, location-specific conditions. By modifying the proxy test for extreme poverty in areas like Homa Bay County where thatch is uncommon, the organization enhances targeting effectiveness and operational efficiency, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Around early November 2014, Mr. Skeates will transition from working full time in Uganda as the Field Director to being based out of GiveDirectly's Kenya office. Mr. Skeates will still spend one week per month in Mbale, Uganda, to oversee the ongoing Uganda 2M campaign. In total, he expects to spend one third of his time on work specific to Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational reallocation based on geographic context. By adjusting his role between Kenya and Uganda, GiveDirectly tailors oversight to location-specific needs, a process that can help optimize resource use and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This location-specific adjustment—relocating the call center—illustrates how operational processes are modified based on geographic factors to reduce risks (such as fraud). Such modifications can contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness by streamlining operations and minimizing losses.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention methods, including targeting criteria, possibly in response to local demographic or operational considerations. Tailoring interventions in this way can help ensure that resources reach the intended recipients efficiently, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its cash transfer distribution methods based on a location-specific factor—the lack of mobile-payment infrastructure. The operational adaptation (using mobile-money agents and informal community members) is designed to lower costs and maintain efficiency, directly addressing how location-specific adjustments can enable cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is adjusting its intervention approach by tailoring targeting criteria based on local feedback from Homa Bay. Such location-specific modifications are part of the operational process, potentially improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of resource allocation by focusing on the most vulnerable groups.

- **Quote:** However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows another example of adjusting charitable interventions based on location-specific factors—in this case, regulatory and operational environments. By reallocating funds from Uganda to Rwanda, GiveDirectly is modifying its strategy to ensure a more favorable operating context, which is an essential operational process aimed at maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy based on location-specific factors, choosing to focus on areas where operational processes are already efficient. By not expanding into new countries, the organization adjusts its approach in response to local cost structures, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to local regulatory and contextual conditions in Rwanda. Adjusting interventions to align with local institutional frameworks and capacity-building needs contributes to cost-effective implementation, demonstrating the role of location-specific adjustments in operational efficiency.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly deliberately paused its intervention rollout to collect baseline data before proceeding, demonstrating a pre-intervention information collection step that influences operational scheduling and may contribute to the charity’s cost-effectiveness by informing later decisions.

- **Quote:** There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly's process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks).
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights the structured operational process where information-gathering activities, such as the census and enrollment (which occur before the actual cash transfer intervention), are distinctly managed. This separation suggests that pre-intervention data collection is an integral part of the charity’s strategy to maintain accurate, efficient, and thus cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a case where pre-intervention data collection—specifically, a baseline survey—directly influenced operational processes. The need to collect information before the intervention forced GiveDirectly to delay token transfers, an operational adjustment made to ensure research integrity. Maintaining proper randomization and study validity through pre-intervention data collection is critical to the charity's overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention information through focus groups to inform and refine its targeting criteria. By integrating local feedback before fully testing the new criteria, the organization is able to adjust its operational processes, which can lead to improved cost-effectiveness by ensuring that resources are directed to the most vulnerable populations.
