## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:
* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
* Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
* Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
* Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
* Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a series of operational adjustments that GiveDirectly is implementing specifically in Uganda, which are tailored to address local challenges such as fraud, limited agent networks, and communication issues. These process adjustments reflect an effort to calibrate operations based on local conditions, potentially boosting oversight and efficiency—factors that are implied to contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is actively considering geographic and socio-political variables—in this case, ethnic composition—to tailor its interventions. By evaluating expansion into areas with different characteristics, the charity appears to be adjusting its operational processes to better align with local contexts, which may enhance the effectiveness and cost efficiency of its programs.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes by recalibrating transfer amounts in Kenya in response to local inflation. By indexing transfers to inflation, the charity ensures that the real value of aid is maintained and aligns with rising local costs, thereby safeguarding cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its beneficiary selection criteria to local conditions. Recognizing that standard indicators like a thatched roof may not be applicable in all regions (e.g., Homa Bay County), the organization explores alternative targeting methods to improve accuracy, which in turn supports more cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner.

Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational adjustment in Uganda where GiveDirectly is experimenting with alternative cash distribution methods. Moving from a centralized 'payday' model to a distributed cashout system—tailored to Uganda's mobile network realities—helps enhance recipient accessibility and potentially reduces logistical inefficiencies, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote from Mr. Skeates' work plan demonstrates that GiveDirectly is actively revising its operational protocols—in this case, altering cash out procedures and targeting criteria—to better align their intervention strategy, potentially reflecting adaptations to local household characteristics. Such adjustments can lead to improvements in the allocation of resources, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational change indicates a recalibration of processes based on geographic and organizational considerations. By relocating the call center to a different city from where field operations occur, GiveDirectly is tailoring its internal structure to mitigate risks (such as fraud) that may be influenced by local conditions, which can indirectly enhance cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.
- **Reasoning:** The appointment of community-nominated monitors highlights an adjustment designed to leverage local knowledge and language skills—key factors in addressing the unique characteristics of the local context. This local tailoring not only improves the accuracy of intervention delivery but also may help in controlling costs by reducing errors or fraudulent activities.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusts its cash transfer distribution process in response to local infrastructural limitations. By leveraging external mobile-money agents and community members in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, the organization tailors its intervention to the unique characteristics of the location—which likely contributes to reducing setup costs and enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines an operational modification aimed at reducing costs. By simplifying the process—specifically by removing a step—the charity seeks to lower operational expenses while facilitating faster enrollment, thereby demonstrating an effort to recalibrate interventions to be more cost effective.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its intervention by modifying its targeting criteria based on localized feedback. By incorporating insights from focus groups, the organization ensures that its enrollment strategy is attuned to the specific vulnerabilities of the local population, which can ultimately improve the efficiency and impact of its interventions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** Here, GiveDirectly adjusts its operational focus by reallocating funds to a different country based on local regulatory and operational challenges. This strategic decision to diversify geographically in response to a less favorable environment in Uganda further supports the idea of tailoring interventions to local conditions in a way that safeguards and potentially enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusted its operational processes in Rwanda to respond to the local regulatory environment, tailoring its capacity-building efforts (such as expedited registration and hiring) to align with unique local characteristics. This kind of calibration likely contributes to smoother operations and enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects a strategic operational decision to focus on refining and maintaining processes in existing locations rather than expanding. By tailoring their approach to areas where they already operate effectively, GiveDirectly improves cost effectiveness, which addresses the research question regarding calibration of interventions to the specific circumstances of each location.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a deliberate operational adjustment made by GiveDirectly prior to full intervention rollout, where baseline data was collected to inform the general equilibrium study. The decision to slow enrollment for pre-intervention data collection highlights how gathering information about a charitable cause can influence operational processes, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness by providing critical early insights.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that collecting pre-intervention information (via a baseline survey) directly affects operational processes; GiveDirectly had to delay its transfers to preserve the study's integrity. This adjustment in operational timing is a clear example of how advanced data collection influences decision-making processes that are crucial to maintaining the charity’s cost-effectiveness.

The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly conducted pre-intervention data collection (via focus groups) to gather insights about beneficiary vulnerability, which then informed the design of their operational process (i.e., targeting criteria). Although the quote does not directly mention cost-effectiveness, tailoring enrollment processes based on early feedback can enhance operational efficiency and ensure resources are directed appropriately, an underlying factor in achieving cost-effective interventions.
