### Not Worth Reading

## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment made in Uganda—moving the complaint hotline and follow-up activities to a different geographic location—to mitigate risks such as fraud. The separation of roles based on local context reflects a tailoring of interventions that can help improve oversight and potentially contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing losses.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusted its operational process by switching mobile money providers based on local infrastructure. By choosing a provider with a larger agent network, the intervention better matches local conditions, likely reducing transaction bottlenecks and potentially lowering costs—an important factor in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement implies that differences in operational processes by location (Kenya versus Uganda) result in varying levels of efficiency. Although not explicitly linked to cost effectiveness, efficiency is a key component of it, suggesting that tailoring processes to local contexts can contribute to better resource use and lower costs.

- **Quote:** Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates an operational adjustment that leverages local expertise and trusted community figures. By building a network of local informants, GiveDirectly adapts its processes to local contexts, which may improve monitoring and early detection of issues, thereby enhancing overall program effectiveness and potentially contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its targeting criteria based on local conditions. Adjusting the proxy test for extreme poverty to align with local characteristics ensures that the intervention is appropriately targeted, which is a key factor in achieving cost-effectiveness in charity operations.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process adjustment where GiveDirectly is modifying its intervention (via cash out day protocols and targeting criteria) possibly to better suit local conditions. Although it does not explicitly state that these changes improve cost effectiveness, tailoring eligibility criteria and intervention protocols based on local factors could reduce inefficiencies and losses.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational change is location-specific, separating functions by geography (Kampala vs. Mbale) to address issues such as fraud. While the quote does not directly link this adjustment to cost savings, separating roles based on local contextual needs is an example of an operational process that may indirectly contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing errors and mismanagement.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that adapts the cash transfer distribution method based on local infrastructure limitations. By employing different approaches where mobile-payment agents are scarce, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to local conditions, potentially lowering operational costs and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Targeting in Homa Bay

All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adjusts its targeting criteria in response to local characteristics gathered from focus groups. Such tailored operational processes can lead to more efficient resource allocation and improved cost effectiveness by ensuring that interventions are better aligned with the specific needs of the community.

- **Quote:** Allocation of funds across countries

GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational decision to adjust the geographic allocation of interventions based on local regulatory and operational climates. By shifting some funding from Uganda to Rwanda in response to local constraints, GiveDirectly is adapting its strategy to maintain efficient operations, which may have cost effectiveness implications.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention operations based on the unique characteristics of existing locations. By focusing on areas with large populations of extreme poverty where they are already operating, they avoid the additional costs of setting up new operations, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:

1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.

2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.

3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the conditions under which GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to consider new locations. The decision framework, which compares the benefits of operating in a new location against the additional expansion costs, underscores how adapting interventions to location-specific characteristics can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly deliberately collected pre-intervention data (in the form of baseline surveys) before fully implementing its intervention. While it does not explicitly link this practice to cost effectiveness, it implies that the charity is willing to adjust its operational processes (even slowing enrollment) in order to gather valuable baseline information, which may later inform more cost-effective operational strategies.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the importance of initiating pre-intervention data collection (in this case, a baseline study) early in the process. Although it does not explicitly address cost effectiveness, it implies that collecting robust pre-intervention data can lead to better-informed operational planning, which may in turn contribute to cost‑effective allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates a direct operational impact of requiring pre-intervention data collection. In order to secure high-quality baseline data, GiveDirectly had to postpone its intervention (the token transfers), showing a trade-off between maintaining research integrity and adhering to planned operational timelines. Although cost effectiveness isn't mentioned explicitly, such delays and adjustments are integral to understanding how pre-intervention data collection can alter cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data through focus groups prior to finalizing its new targeting criteria. While it does not explicitly link this data collection to cost effectiveness, the implication is that using pre-intervention feedback to shape targeting decisions could help optimize operational processes and potentially enhance cost efficiency.
