## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda: * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff).
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a specific operational adjustment tailored to the Ugandan context—segregating roles by relocating the complaint hotline. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, such a process change is aimed at reducing fraud and inefficiencies, which in turn could improve the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention by lowering losses and administrative overhead.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational process by switching to a more widely available mobile money provider in response to local infrastructure limitations. Tailoring the transfer method to a location’s specific context can reduce bottlenecks and potentially lower transaction-related costs, thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement compares operational efficiency between two locations, implying that local-specific operational practices can lead to differences in cost efficiency. It suggests that adapting interventions to suit the local environment—as seen in the Kenyan program—may yield greater operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.

GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adjusts the amount of its cash transfers to respond to local inflation conditions. By indexing transfer amounts to inflation, the organization seeks to preserve both the real value of aid and its overall cost-effectiveness, ensuring that resources continue to deliver the intended impact despite varying local economic conditions.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its targeting criteria based on local contextual factors. By modifying the eligibility metrics to suit the specific conditions of each location, the charity can more effectively target aid, which is likely to enhance cost-effectiveness by ensuring that limited resources are directed to the households most in need.

- **Quote:** The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a location-specific budgeting procedure where efficiency targets and resource allocation are customized based on local operational costs. Tailoring efficiency targets to reflect regional expense structures contributes to maintaining overall cost-effectiveness, as it ensures that interventions are both economically viable and appropriately scaled to local conditions.

- **Quote:** Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a location-specific operational adjustment in response to fraud, where oversight is centralized to reduce risks. Although the text does not state it outright, such a change can help prevent financial losses, thereby contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational change tailors the intervention to local geographic and staffing conditions by separating functions that had previously been too closely linked, likely reducing opportunities for fraud or error and potentially improving overall cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.
- **Reasoning:** By incorporating local community members for monitoring and translation, GiveDirectly adapts its process to the local context. This adjustment helps ensure that the cash distribution reaches the intended recipients, minimizing losses and indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.
- **Reasoning:** This modification of the contractual agreement is a location-specific operational process aimed at mitigating financial risk from theft. Reducing potential losses through such safeguards contributes to protecting resources and thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015.
- **Reasoning:** Adjusting transfer sizes according to inflation represents an operational adaptation to local economic conditions. By ensuring that transfer amounts remain effective over time, this change can help maintain the value of the charity’s interventions, which is an important component of overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process modification aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing expenses, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention methods to the local context—specifically areas with limited mobile-payment infrastructure—thereby avoiding the high costs associated with building new infrastructure and enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an example of tailoring operational processes to local specifics by adapting targeting criteria based on community feedback, which can improve the efficient allocation of resources and indirectly bolster the program's cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly tailors its operational strategy to existing geographic contexts. By choosing to expand within countries where it already operates rather than incurring additional setup costs in new locations, the organization implies that adapting interventions to local specifics can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Capacity-building in Rwanda: GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes in response to Rwanda's unique regulatory and logistical environment. Although it does not explicitly link these adaptations to cost effectiveness, the improved efficiency in registration and staffing suggests that tailoring processes to local conditions may contribute to a more cost-effective intervention.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a deliberate pause in the intervention process to collect baseline (pre-intervention) data, which is essential for evaluating impacts. Although the text does not explicitly link this data collection to increased cost effectiveness, the action implies that acquiring robust pre-intervention data can enable more informed operational decisions—potentially contributing to overall cost effectiveness in the charity's processes.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly prioritizes the collection of essential pre-intervention data (in this case, the baseline survey) before implementing its cash transfer intervention. The need to complete this survey—conducted before the intervention—ensures the validity of the randomization process, which is critical for evaluating the program’s impact. In turn, this careful pre-intervention data collection helps maintain the cost-effectiveness of the charity’s operational processes by avoiding inefficient allocation of resources that might result from flawed study designs or misinformed decisions.

- **Quote:** 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient's phone after the recipient passed away.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that during the pre-intervention enrollment process, external informants help collect essential data – in this case, identifying ineligible households. By filtering out ineligible recipients before cash transfers occur, the charity can avoid wasted funds and misallocations, thereby contributing to improved cost effectiveness in its operational processes.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly gathered qualitative feedback through focus groups prior to finalizing its targeting criteria—that is, before launching the intervention. Although the text does not explicitly connect this pre-intervention data collection step to cost effectiveness, using early, essential data to refine operational decisions can be inferred to help streamline processes and allocate resources more efficiently.
