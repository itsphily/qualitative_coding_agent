## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adjusted its operational processes in Uganda by splitting functions that were combined, mirroring practices already in place in Kenya. This calibration based on local context is aimed at mitigating fraud and possibly enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the adaptation of GiveDirectly's payment process to local conditions, selecting a platform with a broader agent network to offer more flexibility and potentially improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.
- **Reasoning:** This passage indicates that the charity is aware of local socio-political contexts and is contemplating adjustments to its geographic focus, which is a form of calibrating interventions to situational conditions that can influence operational costs and overall effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is tailoring its operational strategy to the local context by using Uganda as a testing ground for experimental approaches, which may lead to innovations aimed at improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This comparison underscores an acknowledgment of operational differences between locations, suggesting that calibration and adaptation in each context are intended to enhance efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its targeting criteria based on local conditions—here, the commonality of thatch—which is an example of calibrating an intervention to the specific circumstances of a location in order to maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly adjusts the value of its cash transfers in response to local economic conditions (i.e., inflation in Kenya), thereby calibrating its intervention to preserve its cost-effectiveness despite changing local cost structures.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its operational benchmarks—specifically, efficiency targets—according to the differing cost environments of various locations, which is a practice aimed at achieving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a location-based operational adaptation where the charity repositions a key component of its service (the call center) to a different city to address local process issues. This adjustment is an example of calibrating interventions according to local conditions, which can play a role in reducing inefficiencies and potentially improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a targeted operational response to a localized problem. By pausing transfers and engaging the community in a specific village with high gaming, GiveDirectly is calibrating its intervention to the unique conditions of that location, an approach that could help avoid misallocation of resources and improve overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:
* **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
* **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly.** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details how GiveDirectly is exploring alternative operational processes that are specifically calibrated to local infrastructure conditions (i.e., areas lacking mobile-payment systems), and it explicitly mentions lowering costs as a benefit. This directly addresses the research question by showing an adaptation designed to achieve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its geographical focus and resource allocation based on varying local regulatory and operational conditions. By shifting some investments from Uganda to Rwanda, the charity demonstrates calibration of interventions to local conditions with the aim of maintaining or improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes—specifically, its targeting criteria—based on localized feedback and conditions. By adjusting criteria for Homa Bay County distinct from those in Uganda, the charity adapts its intervention to the specific context, which can contribute to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion. For this reason, it has not attempted to re-enroll those who refused, but might do so in the future.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows an operational adjustment made in response to local conditions—in this case, high refusal rates. By experimenting with an accelerated schedule to address local mistrust, GiveDirectly is calibrating its intervention process based on contextual challenges, an approach that may also serve to improve overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly adapts its operational strategy by focusing on existing locations where the conditions allow for cost efficiency, rather than expanding into new regions that would incur additional expenses. It illustrates that the charity calibrates its interventions based on local operational conditions to achieve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adjusting its operational processes in Rwanda to meet local conditions, such as strict government regulation. The adaptation to these contextual factors indicates a calibration of their intervention process, which is relevant to understanding how operational adjustments can boost performance and potentially cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that GiveDirectly is actively calibrating its interventions through experimentation in a specific local context (Rwanda). By testing different approaches, the organization is seeking to identify the most cost-effective intervention method tailored to local conditions.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adjustment made specifically to enable the collection of pre-intervention baseline data. By deliberately slowing enrollment, GiveDirectly ensured that researchers could gather essential data before the intervention, an approach that supports informed operational planning and may contribute to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention data collection—in this case through a baseline study—can directly influence operational processes such as the timing of transfers. By sometimes delaying transfers to ensure proper data collection, GiveDirectly adjusts its operational timeline, which is integral to maintaining high cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that collecting pre-intervention data, notably through a census and baseline survey, leads to changes in operational processes like delaying token transfers. Such adjustments are made to protect the integrity of the collected data, indirectly supporting the charity's goal of achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data through focus groups, and used this information to inform and adjust their targeting criteria—a key operational process. By incorporating community feedback (collected prior to full implementation), the organization likely improves its resource allocation and efficiency, which is an essential aspect of achieving cost effectiveness.
