## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Research at GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategies to challenging local contexts by using mobile money for remote communities. It outlines an operational process that ensures secure, efficient, and cost-effective delivery, thereby illustrating adaptation to specific location needs.

- **Quote:** Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that in the wake of a disaster, GiveDirectly adapts its intervention by deploying a rapid, flexible cash-based response tailored to the immediate diverse needs of affected communities. The operational processes—such as conducting surveys and interviews—help ensure that the intervention remains efficient and cost-effective.

### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** At the time of the study, eligibility was determined by living in a house with a thatched (rather than metal) roof. Such households were identified through a census conducted with the help of the village elder.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the charity’s intervention was adapted to the local context by employing a locally relevant poverty indicator (thatched roofs) and leveraging community knowledge (village elder involvement) to identify eligible households.

- **Quote:** GD reports that recipients typically withdraw the entire balance of the transfer upon receipt. The costs of the GD program at the time of the study amounted to $81 (nominal) per household. Given the proportions of large and small transfers sent at the time, this figure translates to a cost of $113 (nominal) per household for a large transfer ($1,000 nominal), that is, 11%, and $69 (nominal) for a small transfer ($300 nominal) per household, that is, 23%. Of these costs, $50 (nominal) were fixed costs for identification and enrollment of households. Variable costs for foreign exchange and other fees were 6.3% of the transfer amount.
- **Reasoning:** Although this passage outlines cost efficiency metrics, it does not detail a location‐specific adaptation and is therefore not used to illustrate calibration to local conditions.

- **Quote:** GD’s operating model has changed since the time of the study. Eligibility is now based not only on a census conducted with a village guide, but is additionally verified by physical back-checks, data back-checks, and crowd-sourced labor to confirm recipient identity and thatched-roof ownership. Transfer amounts are now $1,000 (nominal) per household (corresponding to the “large” transfer amount in the present study), and all eligible households in a village receive transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the charity has refined its intervention strategy by incorporating multiple verification methods to ensure accurate targeting in the local context, contributing to improved operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** In order to be as fair to all as possible, we select recipients using a systematic and proactive set of criteria that vary from country to country, and do not accept inbound applications.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy by altering its selection criteria based on the specific contexts of different countries, thereby tailoring interventions to local needs.

- **Quote:** We chose to work in these countries because they have large populations that are living in extreme poverty and yet are reachable through electronic payment systems, and we were able to raise funds to work there.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the organization selects locations based on both need and infrastructural feasibility, showing adaptation of intervention strategies to local contexts in a cost-effective manner.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track costs with greater granularity
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates an operational process improvement aimed at increasing cost efficiency by refining financial reporting. However, it does not directly address location-specific adjustments and thus is less relevant to the calibration focus.

- **Quote:** We have uncommitted capacity to move $10.6M under the management of two new Field Directors based full-time in the field * Each Field Director (FD) has capacity to move $7M/year to new recipients * Kenya FD has 10 mo of uncommitted capacity in FY14, or $5.8M * Newly recruited [New Country] FD will begin in mid-October and have capacity of $5.0M (adjusted for 2 month apprenticeship) * COO shifts from directly managing transfers in the field to oversight and quality control of entire operation
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the charity adapts its intervention strategies to local needs by assigning dedicated Field Directors in distinct regions and restructuring roles, which supports cost efficiency and tailored operational processes.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Kenya rolling campaign increased speed, with smaller campaigns driving learning in both Kenya and Uganda
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity adapts its intervention approach by implementing a fast-paced rolling campaign in Kenya while also running smaller, iterative campaigns in both Kenya and Uganda, tailoring interventions to local contexts to enhance cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** * Smaller "design lab" projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity incorporates experimental, project-based approaches into its main campaign. These projects enable localized learning and adaptation, ensuring interventions are fine-tuned to meet specific regional needs while maintaining cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly may eventually conduct transfers in urban areas, where targeting criteria would have to change because common housing materials differ.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is considering modifying its intervention strategy to suit urban settings, where differences in local infrastructure—such as housing materials—necessitate changes in targeting criteria.

- **Quote:** It may also work in northern regions of Kenya in the future, where there is no mobile money provider, so GiveDirectly staff would have to either work with branch banks to distribute cash or take armored vehicles with cash on designated distribution dates. These processes would be more expensive and higher risk, but it is something that GiveDirectly would like to build its capacity for.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides insight into how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes when faced with local challenges—in this case, the absence of a mobile money provider—highlighting alternative processes and cost-risk tradeoffs.

- **Quote:** Geographic diversification is one way of preparing for potential issues, because it gives GiveDirectly the flexibility to shift spending out of an area if problems arise. This is one benefit of GiveDirectly expanding to Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This passage indicates that GiveDirectly uses geographic diversification as an operational strategy to manage potential issues and optimize resource allocation across locations, thereby adapting interventions to local conditions while promoting cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly demonstrates that the charity adapts its intervention strategy by collecting location-specific data, allowing for tailored targeting and supporting cost-efficient resource allocation.

- **Quote:** # Community based targeting pilots completed

Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria. Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests. Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)

Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list

Process  
Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction

All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions

In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations
- **Reasoning:** This extended block shows how the charity pilots community-based targeting methods to identify needy households. It evidences an adaptive strategy informed by local community input, refining selection criteria to enhance operational effectiveness and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Cost-benefit analysis: systematic analysis of our end-to-end field model will identify ways to increase efficiency without compromising integrity/user experience (completed by end of august)
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where the charity conducts a cost-benefit analysis of its field model to identify efficiency gains without compromising quality, thus supporting cost-effective adaptations.

### Doc Name: Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly expects this study to provide new and helpful information about both a) whether supplementing cash transfers with the aspirational intervention affects recipients' spending, and b) general information on cash transfers in these Kenyan communities, which are in new areas and for which GiveDirectly will be using new, poverty-based eligibility criteria (as opposed to the specific criteria used previously in Rarieda that targeted people with grass roofs).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention strategy to local needs by changing eligibility criteria in new geographic areas, highlighting tailored approaches to the local socioeconomic context.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has done some non-experimental operational research in remote parts of Uganda to examine the feasibility of implementing its program in places where, e.g., there is no cell coverage, there are no local mobile money agents, villages are several hours on foot from the nearest road, etc. GiveDirectly hopes to gather information about these recipients' experiences of receiving cash transfers, withdrawing transfers, and generally test the limits of who it can get transfers to effectively.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that the charity is investigating how logistical and infrastructural challenges in remote locations affect program implementation, enabling adaptations to ensure effective and cost-efficient delivery.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also expects the study to enable BSZ to compare the cost-effectiveness of cash transfers with the cost-effectiveness of other anti-poverty interventions for coffee farmers that it funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a focus on assessing cost efficiency within a specific local context (coffee farming communities), implying that the charity is evaluating and adapting its intervention strategies based on local characteristics.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an adaptation in intervention strategy where transfer amounts are adjusted to reflect local inflation conditions in Kenya through regular reevaluations, an operational process that helps maintain cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to use campaigns in Uganda to try out new approaches to operational challenges. This is intended to allow GiveDirectly to learn more about activities it could undertake in the future. The board asked Piali Mukhopadhyay and the Uganda team to propose appropriate experimental activities, e.g. work in areas where payment infrastructure is less developed or work in humanitarian settings where the speed of payments supersedes other goals. Uganda naturally presents more operational challenges than Kenya, so it makes sense to experiment with new operational approaches there. In addition, the GE study is the focus in Kenya, so GiveDirectly thinks it is better to locate its operational experimentation elsewhere. GiveDirectly has begun discussing a pilot project in Bukedea District as part of this focus on new operational challenges. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategies based on the specific operational challenges of different locations, particularly by experimenting with new approaches in Uganda where payment infrastructure limitations exist.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a clear adaptation to local conditions by restructuring operations—relocating the complaint hotline to Kampala—to align with location-specific needs and improve oversight and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity adapts its intervention strategy based on local service availability by switching to MTN Mobile Money to provide more flexible and efficient transfer options, supporting cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.
- **Reasoning:** This evidence shows an operational adaptation that leverages local human resources to address specific challenges, customizing monitoring and fraud prevention to the local context for efficient implementation.

- **Quote:** Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
- **Reasoning:** This adjustment reflects an adaptive operational process where real-time monitoring is used to ensure smooth execution during cash transfers, providing immediate quality control and addressing local challenges to maintain cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has allocated most of its current funds towards enrolling recipients in Kenya, in order to continue implementing the rolling model for field operations and to build the sample for the general equilibrium effects study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy by employing a rolling enrollment model in Kenya, indicating a tailored operational approach designed to meet local conditions and enhance cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Relative to Kenya, core operations make up a higher proportion of costs in Uganda because more management time has been invested in setting up GiveDirectly's operations and building the organization in Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational investment based on local context—in Uganda, investing more in setup and management—which influences cost structure and efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Village selection & Manual estimation of & Machine learning & Parish-level census data
  & that-iron proportion & algorithm that & with poverty measures, 
  & using satellite imagery & estimates that-iron & and mobile money 
  & proportion at village & level using satellite imagery &
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt shows that the charity tailors its intervention strategy based on location by employing different village selection methods—manual estimation, machine learning, and census data—in Kenya and Uganda, demonstrating adaptations that influence cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** 2. For example, upcoming work will be informed by recent experimentation on targeting

* "Saturated" 19 villages by giving to all households (excluding those in fully permanent houses)
* Compared recipient experiences of conflict/tension, preferences, and instances of gaming to 18 villages that were treated with "thatch only" criteria
* Conflict and tension were not significantly lower in saturation villages
* Gaming did not significantly decrease
* When faced with the same choice we make, the poor prioritize giving to the poorest
* We therefore plan to use thatch only criteria for upcoming enrollment
* Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
* In a separate meeting, community split into groups and categorized households according to housing materials
* Visited, verified, and registered all households categorized as eligible by saturation criteria from the groups
* Thatch is a popular criteria with communities themselves
* Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture
* Some people were still excluded, having been forgotten by their peers
* Verifying community's recommendations - especially in cases of disagreement between groups - is essential
- **Reasoning:** This block details how targeting strategies are adapted based on local experimentation and community input, illustrating an operational process that refines eligibility criteria to reflect local preferences and conditions.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how intervention strategies are adapted to the local context; in areas where the standard proxy (thatched roof) is not applicable, GiveDirectly is exploring alternative targeting measures to ensure cost-effective and appropriate interventions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details how GiveDirectly is adjusting its distribution method in Uganda based on local conditions. The shift from a payday model to a distributed cashout model, along with proactive communication, exemplifies an operational adaptation aimed at enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides insight into the operational processes that support adaptation by setting country-specific efficiency targets during budgeting, thereby tailoring operational costs to local conditions to ensure cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:

* **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:
  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.
  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
* **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly.** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly is experimenting with alternative cash transfer models tailored to local infrastructural constraints and operational processes, aiming to streamline procedures and lower costs.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria.
These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria.
The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategies based on localized feedback—by implementing distinct targeting criteria in different regions—to customize interventions to local needs.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence of strategic adaptation in response to differing local regulatory environments. By reallocating funds to Rwanda when conditions in Uganda become challenging, GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention approach to ensure continued operational efficiency.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Kenya allocation: finish existing research partnerships and move residual funds
Uganda allocation: sufficient scale to test payment process modifications, and keep scale at or above previous year's
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates that the charity tailors its intervention strategy based on location—with different focuses in Kenya and Uganda—reflecting adaptations to regional operational needs.

- **Quote:** Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput
Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights location-specific operational priorities, with Kenya focusing on maximum throughput and Uganda on enhancing payment security and efficiency, illustrating tailored interventions for cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored
- **Reasoning:** This statement explicitly points to an operational adaptation in Uganda where the charity plans to modify its payments protocol to address local challenges and improve cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** In each of the three campaigns, villages have been selected for enrollment using different mechanisms. In the Kenya 1.2M campaign, villages were selected based on the proportion of match to iron roofs, which was manually estimated using satellite imagery. In the Kenya scale-up, GiveDirectly used a machine learning algorithm that estimates the proportion of match to iron roofs in a village using satellite imagery. The algorithm was developed for GiveDirectly by a group called DataKind, which provided its support pro bono. In the Uganda scale-up, GiveDirectly selected villages based on census data at the parish level (a parish has a few villages). The data allowed GiveDirectly to identify very poor districts in Eastern Uganda, its target region. This data is not easily publicly available; GiveDirectly gained access to it with the help of a group of data scientists at Stanford who are providing pro bono support to GiveDirectly to improve its targeting methodologies.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy based on location-specific data and contextual needs by employing different targeting methods in Kenya and Uganda, thereby tailoring its approach.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty. Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly incorporates local community input to tailor targeting criteria, using a cost-effective operational process that leverages village meetings instead of expensive censuses.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** In the villages in GiveDirectly's two Uganda campaigns to date, about 80% of the households are eligible based on its standard criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor). In Kenya, about 35-45% of the households meet these criteria. GiveDirectly said that it analyzed data on building materials and consumption in Uganda and found a similar correlation to that in Kenya, so it believes that using building materials is still an effective targeting method for reaching the poorest of the poor in Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy based on location-specific data by analyzing building materials and consumption patterns to adapt its targeting criteria, ensuring effectiveness and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** When it experimented with making transfers to all households in a village ('saturation model'), GiveDirectly did not see a major change in its costs or in the number of people 'gaming' the system by pretending to be eligible.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational test of the saturation model to assess its impact on cost efficiency, reflecting how the charity evaluates whether broadening the intervention affects costs and efficiency.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, there are no counties, so GiveDirectly coordinates with a few people at the district level to acquire approvals, and from there connect with officials at the local level.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to the local administrative structure in Uganda, streamlining government approvals to better suit local conditions and enhance cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Field officers bring maps that GiveDirectly has had prepared by members of the village and also find a person who lives in the village to serve as a guide and show them the boundaries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly leverages local resources—community-prepared maps and local guides—to accurately define village boundaries during the census phase, an adaptation that supports comprehensive coverage and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** The logistics are significantly harder in Uganda than in Kenya. For example, when GiveDirectly enters a new village in Uganda, over 90% of recipients need SIM cards because they did not previously have cell phones, and about 70-80% of recipients need national IDs. GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there are 9 villages, and GiveDirectly was able to put them all through the national ID registration process within 1 month, so that 90% of eligible households were ready to receive transfers when payments started.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed operational description shows how GiveDirectly adapts its processes in Uganda by organizing registration drives to secure SIM cards and national IDs, ensuring rapid and efficient readiness for cash transfers and reducing recipient costs.

- **Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly experimented with a community-based targeting process, whereby residents gave input on households that they felt were deserving of transfers but had been excluded by GiveDirectly's criteria. GiveDirectly felt that to do this process well required significant resources (staff time) and that the benefits were not worth the costs. In addition, some of the villages involved in this experiment gave feedback that they would prefer for GiveDirectly to make the decisions about targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an instance where GiveDirectly considered adapting its intervention through community-based targeting but ultimately decided against it due to resource constraints, underscoring its commitment to operational processes that support cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** In order to address this question, we've created 3 groups of randomly assigned villages for GiveDirectly's most recent campaign in Kenya:

1. Villages in which no households will receive transfers
2. Villages in which only mud-wall and hatch-roof households will receive transfers
3. Villages in which nearly all households will receive transfers (all households with mud walls and thatch _or_ metal roofs will receive transfers, only households with cement walls and metal roofs will be excluded)
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly’s experimental approach by segmenting villages based on local housing characteristics, an adaptation that targets different groups based on their specific needs.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation. GiveDirectly is pursuing both structural and operational questions for future research. While we want to maximize our experimentation and testing, any additional steps we add increase the complexity of the operations that our staff have to manage, so that is a consideration.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines GiveDirectly’s focus on adjusting operational procedures—such as modifying field staff compensation—to improve efficiency, directly addressing processes that support cost-effective adaptations.

- **Quote:** Village saturation: Randomized selection of 18 villages to apply saturation approach (with same size group for thatch and control)
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a change in the field process using a saturation approach through randomized village selection, suggesting an operational adjustment designed to address local differences while maintaining cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Staff incentives: Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * Census: Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * Enrollment: Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * Back check: Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process where staff performance is incentivized through bonuses linked to specific metrics, promoting accuracy and timeliness in field operations and supporting cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has implemented a "rolling model" in Kenya that enables all three steps of enrollment to occur simultaneously in different villages. Field staff now work continuously, year‐round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy in Kenya by using a rolling model that aligns enrollment processes with local operational needs, potentially enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Currently, Field Directors spend much of their time downloading tables and manipulating them in Excel as well as producing rosters of work to email to Field Officers. The process of producing rosters of work is one example of a step that can be fully automated. The time savings achieved will allow Field Directors to spend more time on designing and piloting process innovations and other structural improvements.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of operational process automation aimed at saving Field Directors' time, which supports overall cost efficiency, though it is not explicitly tied to location-specific calibration.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that it decided to conduct a second campaign this year, despite knowing that it would end up pausing enrollment afterwards, to take advantage of its presence in Uganda to build out the organizational structure and operations there, which were not as formally established as those in Kenya.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a location-specific adaptation in Uganda where the charity adjusts its intervention approach to build organizational capacity in a less established context, supporting long-term cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly selected a region of the country to set up initial operations in based on poverty data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy by using objective local data (poverty metrics) to select regions, directly addressing adaptation to specific location needs.

- **Quote:** The governance structure of the second country is more decentralized than in Kenya, which required GiveDirectly to spend slightly more time working with local authorities before starting transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes by engaging more with local authorities in a decentralized setting, accommodating local administrative conditions for better cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to work with two different mobile money services in the second country. Initially, it was only planning to work with one mobile money service, but decided to run a dual-provider pilot after identifying a promising new company providing electronic transfers linked to, but not dependent on, mobile phones. It determined this could be valuable given concerns about poor cell phone network coverage in the targeted geography and limitations with the other mobile money service's customer service). It has since established a partnership with this second company for roughly half of its planned transfers in the campaign. While the first service has more agents nationwide, the second service has been more willing to collaborate with GiveDirectly and customize the service to its needs. GiveDirectly was able to start transferring funds through the second company more quickly than the first for logistical reasons. GiveDirectly sent us data on the amounts and schedule of past and planned transfers for 173 recipients in the second country. GiveDirectly notes that it is still working out the disbursement schedule, so exact dates for future transfers are not yet determined. In response, GiveDirectly has been more proactive in coordinating with the mobile money service for the transfers that have begun, for example, by giving the mobile money service advanced notice before sending the funds so that agents could be prepared. In some cases, agents traveled to the villages in which recipients live to reduce recipient travel time.
- **Reasoning:** This extended quote shows multiple layers of adaptation: switching from a single-provider to a dual-provider mobile money model in response to local infrastructural challenges. Such proactive coordination reflects operational processes designed to overcome local logistical hurdles and enhance cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** In early 2016, GiveDirectly allocated a fairly large sum of money to test a new implementation model in Kenya. A separate field director and team were hired approximately six months ago, and the experiment is taking place in an area close to GiveDirectly's other field operations. The primary aim is to double the program's size in 2017 without significantly increasing the management structure. The new model seeks to increase throughput per manager by eliminating the token payment and back check steps. GiveDirectly will assess gains in throughput as well as costs, which might occur in the areas of comprehension and fraud. Results and data should be available after a few months of disbursements. By the end of 2016, GiveDirectly hopes to have a blueprint for implementing a similar model in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention strategy in Kenya by experimenting with a new model that streamlines operational processes to increase throughput and reduce costs, directly addressing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** In its Uganda program, GiveDirectly has often found the 'payday' payment model too restrictive. In its Uganda program, it has successfully tested a 'cash-out' model. Recipients and agents were able to overcome liquidity constraints, and in Uganda, GiveDirectly distributes $700,000 to $1 million per month without any increases in fraud.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an adaptation in intervention strategy in Uganda by shifting from a 'payday' model to a 'cash-out' model, thereby addressing liquidity constraints while maintaining cost efficiency and controlling fraud.

- **Quote:** After observing an increase in refusals in its Kenya program, GiveDirectly began offering services in a different sub-county (Nyando). Initial refusal rates in Nyando were also very high, which indicated that this might be a broader problem requiring additional attention and resources. GiveDirectly created an outreach team to focus on this issue, which has been operating for three months. The team is employing a variety of different tactics: for example, it is communicating with relevant community stakeholders and using media to disseminate recipient testimonial videos and other materials. It will use A/B testing to assess the effectiveness of different strategies. During a period of a couple of months, the refusal rate dropped from an average of 70% to 20-30%, but it has rebounded significantly in the last couple of weeks.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of a location-specific adaptation in Kenya where high refusal rates prompted GiveDirectly to adjust its operational approach by creating an outreach team and employing multiple tactics, demonstrating a commitment to cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly could use more funds to start cash transfer programs that it would intend to pass to governments once the value of the programs had been demonstrated. For example, GiveDirectly could offer several million dollars and early management assistance to encourage a government to try cash transfers. Such a program would be donor-funded while new systems were being put in place and while operational problems were being solved; then, if the program were successful, GiveDirectly could pass it to the government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a phased intervention strategy where initial donor funding is used to refine systems before transitioning management to local governments, supporting tailored local adaptation and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** A program in Kenya serving orphans and vulnerable children began as a two-year UNICEF pilot project funded with $10 million from donors. At the end of the two years, UNICEF transferred the project to the Kenyan government, which has spent $30 million on it over 4 years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote offers a concrete example of adapting an intervention to local needs by piloting a project in Kenya and then transferring it to the local government, highlighting a sustainable, cost-effective operational process.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's operational expertise is particularly valuable in its work with governments.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the importance of strong operational processes in facilitating collaborations with governments, implying that such expertise is key to adapting interventions to local contexts while maintaining cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** A single campaign (not a rolling campaign) is planned in Uganda, as a 'payments pilot'. This will be designed to learn about the different payment systems that could be used for transfers; the focus on learning about payments will slow the program down.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy based on location-specific needs by using a pilot campaign in Uganda to test alternative payment systems, illustrating a tailored approach to local conditions.

- **Quote:** If GiveDirectly were to receive additional retail donations on the order of $1-3 million from retail donors, the board would likely allocate the donations to transfers in Kenya. GiveDirectly still plans to scale up in Kenya and wants to retain its staff there. In addition, retail donations must be committed to the field, as this is indicated on GiveDirectly's website. If there were a strategic opportunity in Uganda, the board might decide to commit retail donations which had been specified for distribution in any country there.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt provides insight into the operational funding allocation process, showing that decisions are made based on strategic, location-specific opportunities, which supports cost-efficient adaptation of interventions.

- **Quote:** Additional revenue raised throughout the year is accumulated on a month-to-month basis without being allocated. If new funding has reached a substantial enough level by the next board meeting, the board may allocate it to a new opportunity, to existing projects, or to a future year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process for funding allocation based on periodic assessments, ensuring resources are efficiently directed to where they are most needed, which supports adaptive interventions and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Deployment of the Segovia system in Kenya is ongoing in parallel with development; new features are incorporated and bugs are worked out in the field, in real time. GiveDirectly plans to begin using Segovia in Uganda at some point in 2015, although an exact date has not been chosen. The exact date of the rollout in Uganda will depend on whether or not Segovia is suitable for the payments pilot.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the use of an adaptable technology platform (Segovia) that is continuously refined in Kenya before a potential rollout in Uganda, illustrating real-time operational adjustments that support cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** One important metric is the time saved by FDs; FDs are informally keeping track of these timesavings and how they are using their increased capacity. Given that FD time is a significant cost for GiveDirectly, being able to put a dollar value onto the time saved by Segovia will give a strong indication of whether or not the system is useful.
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains how GiveDirectly measures operational efficiency through time savings by Field Directors, quantifying the benefits of process adaptations like Segovia to ensure cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly adapts its strategy by focusing on deepening operations in existing locations rather than expanding, driven by a cost efficiency consideration to minimize additional setup expenses.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts to the specific regulatory and operational context in Rwanda by rapidly increasing capacity and coordinating with local authorities, ensuring cost-efficient adaptation.

### Doc Name: Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa. While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention to local conditions by using a locally relevant indicator (thatch roofs) and leveraging an existing mobile money infrastructure (M-Pesa) to deliver funds efficiently, thereby supporting cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** In YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades. In general, participants were "young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed."
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an adaptation of the intervention strategy to address specific local economic needs by targeting youth in rural areas for vocational training, reflecting how the charity tailors its approach to the demographic context.

- **Quote:** The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash. Had the study continued longer, the cheaper ongoing costs of the cell phone transfer mechanism would have made up for the higher initial costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that supports cost efficiency by comparing different delivery mechanisms, demonstrating how testing electronic transfers can lead to lower ongoing costs—a process adapted to local logistical and technological conditions.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2012.md
- **Quote:** 1. Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how the charity tailors its intervention strategy to the specific needs of each location by using localized epidemiological and infrastructural data for area selection, supporting cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details the operational process that adapts the intervention to local site characteristics, ensuring that dispensers are installed in locations where they will be most effective and sustainable, thereby supporting cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** During this time, there were also multiple RCTs run. These studies assessed various aspects of chlorination programs, including community financing, promoter monitoring and incentives, and how public officials make decisions about the provision of public goods. DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%,and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity employs an adaptive approach by running pilots and RCTs to determine which intervention strategies work best in different locations, ensuring locally appropriate and cost-efficient interventions.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt evidences how the charity learns from early implementation challenges and revises its operational procedures; the adjustment of placement instructions after suboptimal outcomes demonstrates an adaptive process for improving efficiency.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2014.md
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly adapted its intervention to local conditions by organizing cash out days in Uganda, reducing transportation costs and addressing the limitations of the local agent network, thereby enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the pre-intervention operational processes that support the adapted strategy, ensuring that the intervention is tailored to local needs and operates cost-efficiently.

- **Quote:** After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides detail on the real-time operational adjustments made during a cash out day. Grouping individuals by issue type to troubleshoot more efficiently demonstrates an adaptive approach aimed at maintaining smooth, cost-effective intervention delivery despite local challenges.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Research at GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Status: Baseline surveying and cash payments launched in 2019
- **Reasoning:** This quote from the Malawi study indicates that GiveDirectly conducts pre-intervention baseline surveys before cash payments begin. It shows that initial data collection is part of their operational setup, though it does not explicitly detail how this information is used to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Status: Baseline surveying and cash payments launched in 2018
- **Reasoning:** This quote from the Liberia study demonstrates that baseline surveys are undertaken as part of launching cash transfers, representing pre-intervention data collection. However, the quote does not elaborate on how this collected information contributes to streamlining operations or achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Status: Research ethics clearance secured, baseline survey due to launch Q4 2019
- **Reasoning:** This quote from the study on cash transfers to refugees and host nationals confirms that a baseline survey (a form of pre-intervention data collection) is planned before intervention implementation, yet it does not describe its role in informing operational processes that lead to cost-effective charity delivery.

### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** • Following the census, all eligible households completed the baseline survey between April and November 2011. The order of census and surveys was randomized at the village level (after the first four villages, which were chosen for proximity to the field office). No transfers or transfer announcements were made before or during census or baseline in each village. The surveys were described to respondents in the same fashion as the census, that is, without reference to GD or transfers.

A household was considered eligible if it had a thatched roof. The purpose of the census and baseline was described to village elders and respondents as providing information to researchers about living conditions in the area; no mention was made of GD or transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that extensive pre-intervention data collection was conducted to establish baseline living conditions and eligibility criteria (a thatched roof) before any transfers were announced. By gathering this information upfront, the organization could accurately identify and target the households in need, thereby streamlining the allocation process and reducing resource wastage—key components of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 1. GD first identified Rarieda, Kenya, as a study district, based on data from the national census. The research team identified the 120 villages with the highest proportion of matched roofs within Rarieda. Sixty villages were randomly chosen to be treatment villages (first stage of randomization).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pre-intervention data from a national census was used to pinpoint areas with the highest need. By leveraging existing data to select villages with a high concentration of vulnerable households, the charity ensured that its subsequent operations could be efficiently targeted, thereby contributing to the overall cost effective management of resources.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Currently, our default is to locate extremely poor villages using poverty data from national surveys, and then enroll all households in the village.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly uses pre-existing data (collected before the intervention) on poverty levels to inform its targeting process. By leveraging national survey data to select extremely poor villages, the organization simplifies and streamlines its operational decisions, thereby reducing administrative and screening costs and enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Data from 2005/6 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey, which includes housing materials, demonstrates that there are 3.5 million households that meet the eligibility criteria in rural areas; estimated 72% penetration rate of M-Pesa among Kenyan adults living under $1.25 / day.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly leverages pre-existing, pre-intervention survey data to determine the target population, which in turn informs their operational planning and cost estimations. By identifying eligible households using detailed, baseline data, the charity can design interventions that are more cost effective.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that, before implementing interventions, detailed data on poverty is collected. Such pre-intervention information helps in accurately targeting areas with the greatest need, thereby enabling operational processes that are more cost effective.

- **Quote:** This represents our first in-house data collection, and a change in policy: whenever treatments are variations on how to do cash (rather than: does cash work at all?) we do not face a conflict of interest and can be involved in data collection
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates a policy shift towards conducting data collection in-house, a change motivated by cost reasons. It highlights how pre-intervention data collection is being integrated into operational planning, potentially reducing expenses and streamlining processes, which contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** Once the 300 villages for the study have been selected, IPA will perform a census of every household in those villages, then do a baseline survey of 30 households randomized from within that census. Once all villages have been randomized into one of the three study arms (i.e. long-term basic income, short-term basic income, or lump sum transfers as the control arm), GiveDirectly's field officers will do a census of the villages (except for control villages) and enroll all eligible adults.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the pre-intervention data collection process in the UBI study, where a comprehensive census and baseline survey are conducted before enrolling participants. This systematic collection of information on the target population is an operational step that helps ensure efficient and accurate enrollment, which can in turn support cost-effectiveness by enabling the charity to allocate resources precisely.

- **Quote:** About 550 households were included in a baseline survey. The study did not randomize which recipients received transfers and which did not. Recipients were randomized to either receive payments immediately or after a delay.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt from the Transfer designs study describes a baseline survey conducted before the intervention, illustrating how pre-intervention data collection informs decisions such as timing and structure of transfers. Such operational procedures help optimize resource distribution, which is a key factor in achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** They use the % of households censused as eligible that then turn out to be ineligible during backcheck and audit as a measure of gaming. The overall variability in this measure is relatively small--2.6% of households are found to be ineligible in an average village, and villages at the 90th percentile have 6.3% of households found to be ineligible (n=111 villages).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collects baseline (pre-intervention) data through an eligibility census to measure the extent of gaming. By assessing eligibility before transfers, the organization can detect discrepancies and ensure that resources are directed appropriately, an operational step that contributes to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the Kenyan village called Ayo A, in which there were much higher levels of gaming than is common, GiveDirectly held a community meeting to discuss the problem. At the meeting, staff told recipients that GiveDirectly would not work in areas where people are dishonest, and that it was pausing transfers until the issues were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked recipients to report any information they had about the gaming.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the information collected during the pre-intervention eligibility process is used operationally. The decision to pause transfers and engage the community in addressing gaming is an example of using data to inform processes that help maintain efficient, cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly deliberately prioritized collecting pre-intervention data by slowing enrollment to allow baseline surveys to be conducted. Such pre-intervention data collection can inform the organization’s understanding of local conditions and potential risks, which in turn may enable more efficient and cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** The researchers will start collecting baseline data in August 2014, before token transfers are sent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly shows that GiveDirectly collects pre-intervention data (baseline data) before any transfers occur. This collection of information forms an initial assessment of the charitable cause and provides a foundation for measuring impact, which in turn informs operational decisions that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's fundraising deadline for these transfers is January 2015, as that is when the baseline measurement will be complete for the first set of villages, so if measurement is going to be extended, the researchers would need to know by January. Increasing the number of villages in the study will also increase measurement costs, so it would be helpful for the research team to have lead-time for their own fundraising before January.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the timing of pre-intervention baseline data collection with operational planning and budgeting (e.g., fundraising deadlines and managing measurement costs). It indicates that collecting information beforehand is integral to planning and adjusting resource allocation, which is a key component of achieving cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Village selection & Manual estimation of & Machine learning & Parish-level census data \  
  & that-iron proportion & algorithm that & with poverty measures, \  
  & using satellite imagery & estimates that-iron & and mobile money \  
  & level using satellite imagery & & \
- **Reasoning:** This block from the table details the pre-intervention data collection methods used for village selection across different campaigns. By collecting information through techniques such as satellite imagery, machine learning, and census data before the intervention begins, the charity can more accurately target villages. Such targeted operational planning is likely to enable more efficient resource allocation, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention qualitative data was collected directly from the community via village meetings. Gathering local input on eligibility criteria before enrollment enables the charity to align its operational processes with community needs, thereby potentially reducing wasted resources and enhancing cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Building the enrollment database has been the focus of GiveDirectly's adoption of Segovia so far. The enrollment database contains information gathered by the census team, registration team, and backcheck team. GiveDirectly uses this database to determine cash transfer eligibility, record activities, draw up work plans, and determine which data to audit.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collects data through teams (census, registration, and backcheck) prior to implementing cash transfers. This pre-intervention data collection is used to guide key operational processes—such as determining eligibility and planning work—which helps streamline operations and enhances cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers. The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly integrates pre-intervention data collection (the baseline survey) into its operational timeline. By ensuring that the baseline data is collected before transfers are made, the charity maintains the integrity and validity of its research studies, thereby informing operational decisions that ultimately contribute to cost-effective service delivery.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly gathers qualitative data through focus groups prior to fully implementing new targeting criteria. By collecting this information before testing, the organization is able to refine its operational processes to better identify and serve the most vulnerable populations, which can contribute to increased cost-effectiveness in its charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md
- **Quote:** On the fourth point, it took recipients in its first round of enrollment an average of 1.3 months to register in GiveDirectly's first round of transfers. GiveDirectly cut this amount of time to 0.1 months for recipients in its second round of enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that GiveDirectly collects operational data during the enrollment phase—data that is gathered before the actual cash transfers occur (pre-intervention). By tracking and comparing registration times between rounds, the charity was able to identify inefficiencies and streamline its process, an adjustment that would likely contribute to its overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly used the categorized lists generated from these village meetings in place of a census. Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote is pre-intervention evidence from the community-based targeting process where information about household characteristics is collected before enrollment. It explicitly highlights a cost-saving benefit by replacing a full census with locally organized data collection, thereby contributing to operational processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the Kenya scale-up, GiveDirectly used a machine learning algorithm that estimates the proportion of match to iron roofs in a village using satellite imagery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the use of pre-intervention data collection via remote sensing and automated analysis to identify poverty indicators. While it does not explicitly mention cost savings, employing technology to gather needed data likely reduces the time and expense associated with manual surveys, contributing indirectly to more cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** In the villages in GiveDirectly's two Uganda campaigns to date, about 80% of the households are eligible based on its standard criteria (thatch roof, mud walls, mud floor). In Kenya, about 35-45% of the households meet these criteria. GiveDirectly said that it analyzed data on building materials and consumption in Uganda and found a similar correlation to that in Kenya, so it believes that using building materials is still an effective targeting method for reaching the poorest of the poor in Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collects and analyzes data on household characteristics (such as building materials and consumption) as part of its targeting criteria. Such pre-intervention data collection informs their operational processes, helping to identify eligible households efficiently, which can contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed to those most in need.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly did not used to do a census of the whole village before registering eligible households. The census was added so that GiveDirectly could have a full picture of the village, not miss any households, and would be better able to track households that were shifting around. Also, without a census documenting information about each household, it is more likely that word would spread about households being registered and other households would try to pose as eligible when they were first visited.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention data collection process (the census) implemented to ensure comprehensive information about the community is gathered before rollout. By doing so, GiveDirectly can accurately capture and track all households, avoid registration errors or fraud, and thereby streamline operational processes that are crucial for maintaining cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** In August, GiveDirectly plans to begin baseline data collection for its study of general equilibrium effects of cash transfers in Kenya. All households in Kenya that receive their initial transfers after baseline data has been collected will be included in the study until funds for the study's transfers have been exhausted. Households that receive transfers before baseline data collection is complete will not be included in the study's sample.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the process of pre-intervention (baseline) data collection, showing how GiveDirectly uses information collected before interventions (cash transfers) to determine which households are included in their study. This systematic approach to collecting pre-intervention data informs operational decisions (such as pausing enrollments to ensure data integrity), which can contribute to more efficient and cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly selected a region of the country to set up initial operations in based on poverty data. GiveDirectly has sent us the data that it relied on to target this region, which we plan to review and incorporate into a future update.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection activity where GiveDirectly used poverty data to target and select the region for its operations. This pre-intervention step is integral to planning the intervention efficiently, which can help the charity operate more cost effectively.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is also conducting a $2 million campaign in Kenya, for which it has completed a census and is proceeding with household enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly completed a census before launching the campaign, a clear example of pre-intervention data collection. Such data collection provides the necessary groundwork for effectively planning and executing the intervention, thereby contributing to the charity's cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** The ongoing study on the general equilibrium effects of direct cash transfers is expected to finish collecting baseline data around the middle of 2015. Endline data will be gathered approximately one year after baseline.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is collecting baseline data (pre-intervention data) for its study of the impact of cash transfers. Baseline data collection is a form of gathering information about the charitable cause before the intervention takes place. While the quote does not detail how this data directly informs cost‐effective operational processes, it shows an effort to establish an evidence base that could later shape operational adjustments to improve cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote implies that GiveDirectly collects observable pre-intervention information (in this case, identifying households by the type of roof they have) to target eligible beneficiaries. Such an operational process—using relatively simple, pre-collected data—is intended to streamline targeting and screening, potentially lowering administrative costs and contributing to the charity's overall cost effectiveness. However, the document provides limited further detail on how this pre-intervention data collection directly feeds into broader operational cost‐effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2012.md
- **Quote:** 1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a pre-intervention step where DSW collects critical data (diarrhea rates, waterborne diseases, water source characteristics, and population density) to select target areas for their intervention. By identifying locations with the greatest need, this process supports operational decision-making aimed at maximizing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that IPA gathers baseline (pre-intervention) data on water treatment practices. Such data collection establishes a clear starting point, enabling the charity to measure the impact of its interventions accurately, thus informing operational processes and ensuring resources are used cost-effectively.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Smaller "design lab" projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pilot projects—in the form of smaller, experimental design lab initiatives—are integrated into the overall operational flow. This integration allows the charity to test new methods and improve efficiency, directly supporting the investigation of how such pilots enhance cost-effectiveness when entering new locations.

- **Quote:** Research and scoping project with The Rockefeller Foundation exploring synergy between cash programs and index insurance that included a field pilot
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates the use of a field pilot as part of a research and scoping project. The pilot project serves as an operational process to evaluate innovative methods (synergies between cash programs and index insurance) which may lead to enhanced cost-effectiveness, aligning directly with the research question.

- **Quote:** Gave 225 past recipients a 5100 transfer and option to purchase index insurance protecting against drought with transfer, showing much lower acquisition costs than typical insurance providers get and high recipient demand ( 62%)
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides concrete evidence of cost-effectiveness resulting from a pilot initiative. The lower acquisition costs and high recipient demand reported here indicate that the pilot project's operational process may contribute to improved cost efficiency, thus addressing the research question.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** Community based targeting pilots completed

Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria. Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests. Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)

Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list

Process
Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction
All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions
In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations
Majority of households are widows, almost half have one family member that is disabled or very sick. Households seem to be as or more needy than typical GD recipients
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the pilot project process implemented for community-based targeting. It shows how the charity tests an alternative method for identifying needy households—a process that, when refined, has the potential to enhance cost-effectiveness in new locations by improving targeting efficiency and operational procedures.

- **Quote:** Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations). May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs. Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict. Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly connects the use of pilot projects to evaluating cost tradeoffs and refining operational methods. It illustrates that by piloting modifications (such as supplemental targeting measures) and analyzing the additional cost per household, the charity can optimize its process for enhanced cost-effectiveness before full-scale implementation in new locations.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is planning to use campaigns in Uganda to try out new approaches to operational challenges. This is intended to allow GiveDirectly to learn more about activities it could undertake in the future.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is using pilot campaigns in a new location (Uganda) as an experimental operational process. By testing new approaches to overcome operational challenges, the organization aims to identify methods that could ultimately lead to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has begun discussing a pilot project in Bukedea District as part of this focus on new operational challenges. GiveDirectly is considering managing cash withdrawals for recipients in the pilot rather than relying on an independent mobile money network, pending board approval.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of a pilot project in a new location, where the charity is experimenting with a different operational method (direct management of cash withdrawals). Such experimentation is designed to evaluate whether this approach can improve efficiency and reduce costs, aligning with the research question.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly mentions a pilot project aimed at testing a new operational model (distributed cashout) for transferring funds. Although it is described in the context of Uganda rather than a new location per se, it exemplifies how pilot projects are used to experiment with cost-saving, efficient processes that could be applied when entering new areas.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process activated when entering a new area. While it is not labeled as a pilot project, it functions as an experimental mechanism to quickly and cost-effectively screen households, reflecting a similar concept of piloting methods to enhance efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** In the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational pilot project where a specific management structure was tested during the Uganda campaign. The pilot exposed shortcomings (e.g., staff fraud) and led to subsequent process adjustments aimed at safeguarding funds, thereby implying a mechanism for enhancing cost-effectiveness through iterative operational improvements.

- **Quote:** Improved security is a reason why GiveDirectly is interested in piloting biometric authentication for mobile money accounts, though it does not currently have plans to do so.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is considering the use of pilot projects to test new technologies (biometric authentication) to improve security. By piloting such innovations, the organization seeks to reduce losses and enhance operational efficiency, which can contribute to overall cost-effectiveness when entering or operating in a new location.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:

* Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:
  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.
  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
* A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines experimental, pilot testing approaches to modifying the cash transfer process—which serve as operational interventions intended to lower costs and improve speed. Although not explicitly tied to geographic entry, these pilot projects represent the type of process innovation a charity might employ when entering a new location to enhance cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Uganda allocation: sufficient scale to test payment process modifications, and keep scale at or above previous year's
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that in Uganda—a new location—the charity is using its allocation as a pilot to test modifications to its payment process. This operational experiment is designed to identify efficiency gains, directly linking pilot projects with efforts to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Urban pilot -limited interest expressed by inst. donors, govt, private donors in urban
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that a pilot project was conducted in an urban setting to assess donor interest. By piloting operations in a new type of location, the charity aims to determine whether the operational model will be cost-effective.

- **Quote:** Challenging geography pilot - planning requirements and logistical challenges will overstretch current mgmt capacity
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a pilot project in a challenging geographical area where the planning and logistical challenges are being tested. The evaluation of such operational hurdles provides insights into whether entering a new location through a pilot approach can be scaled in a cost-effective manner.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly mentions pilot projects (village meetings) conducted to tailor eligibility criteria based on local input. Such pilots can serve as an operational process to adapt to local contexts, potentially reducing costs by leveraging community knowledge rather than expensive, broad data collection methods.

- **Quote:** Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links the pilot project approach to cost-effectiveness by highlighting that community-based targeting (a pilot process) may reduce expenses compared to conducting a full census. It provides evidence that piloting operational methods can foster more efficient resource use.

### Doc Name: Matt_Johnson_Paul_Niehaus_06-28-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has plans to pilot a program giving cash transfers to refugees. This program has been delayed in the approvals process, so it has not yet begun. The delay has given GiveDirectly time to line up commitments to fully fund the pilot. GiveDirectly has not yet launched a retail fundraising campaign for the refugee program, because it is waiting for final approval from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Once the program has been approved, GiveDirectly will allow retail donors to donate to the refugee cash transfer program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes the refugee pilot program as an operational step taken before full implementation. By delaying the launch until commitments and approvals are secured, the pilot process helps mitigate risks and potentially enhances overall cost-effectiveness. Although the text does not explicitly state that this pilot is used when entering a new location, it provides moderate insight into how a pilot project can function as an operational process aimed at ensuring efficient allocation of resources.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Village saturation: Randomized selection of 18 villages to apply saturation approach (with same size group for thatch and control)
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational pilot method where a subset of villages is randomly selected to test a saturation approach. Such a controlled pilot experiment can help the charity assess the effectiveness of their operational process and potentially improve resource deployment, even though it does not explicitly state outcomes in terms of cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Staff incentives: Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: Census: Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) Enrollment: Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) Back check: Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a pilot operational process that tests a performance-based incentive scheme among field staff. The approach is designed to improve metrics such as census accuracy and timely registration, which could indirectly enhance cost-effectiveness through improved operational efficiency, though no direct cost outcomes are mentioned.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** Going into 2014, GiveDirectly decided to enroll an additional 2,000 households in Uganda as part of a second campaign, beyond the approximately 900 households included in the first Uganda campaign. GiveDirectly expects to complete enrollment for the second campaign in August, after which point it will pause its enrollment of new recipients in Uganda. GiveDirectly told us that it decided to conduct a second campaign this year, despite knowing that it would end up pausing enrollment afterwards, to take advantage of its presence in Uganda to build out the organizational structure and operations there, which were not as formally established as those in Kenya. GiveDirectly also said that it can be a useful skill for development organizations to be able to scale up and down quickly, and its experience in Uganda would help build this skill.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly uses a limited-scope campaign in a new location (Uganda) as a pilot project to build and test its operational structure. By intentionally pausing further enrollment after the pilot phase, the organization is able to refine its processes and develop the capacity to scale up or down quickly—an approach that, while not explicitly labelled as cost-effectiveness, implies long-term efficiency gains by learning to manage resources optimally in new operational contexts.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Initially, it was only planning to work with one mobile money service, but decided to run a dual-provider pilot after identifying a promising new company providing electronic transfers linked to, but not dependent on, mobile phones. It determined this could be valuable given concerns about poor cell phone network coverage in the targeted geography and limitations with the other mobile money service's customer service). It has since established a partnership with this second company for roughly half of its planned transfers in the campaign. While the first service has more agents nationwide, the second service has been more willing to collaborate with GiveDirectly and customize the service to its needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that as GiveDirectly entered a new country, they implemented a pilot project—a dual-provider model—to test alternative mobile money services. The pilot enabled them to address local operational challenges (like poor network coverage and suboptimal customer service) and to choose a partner willing to tailor services to their needs, illustrating an operational process intended to enhance cost-effectiveness in the new location.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** In early 2016, GiveDirectly allocated a fairly large sum of money to test a new implementation model in Kenya. A separate field director and team were hired approximately six months ago, and the experiment is taking place in an area close to GiveDirectly's other field operations. The primary aim is to double the program's size in 2017 without significantly increasing the management structure. The new model seeks to increase throughput per manager by eliminating the token payment and back check steps. GiveDirectly will assess gains in throughput as well as costs, which might occur in the areas of comprehension and fraud. Results and data should be available after a few months of disbursements. By the end of 2016, GiveDirectly hopes to have a blueprint for implementing a similar model in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a pilot project where GiveDirectly experiments with a new operational model intended to enhance cost-effectiveness by streamlining processes and reducing management overhead. The focus on assessing cost gains and throughput, together with the plan to use this blueprint in other countries, suggests its potential application when entering new locations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has often found the 'payday' payment model too restrictive. In its Uganda program, it has successfully tested a 'cash-out' model. Recipients and agents were able to overcome liquidity constraints, and in Uganda, GiveDirectly distributes $700,000 to $1 million per month without any increases in fraud.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another experimental pilot project where an alternative payment model is tested to overcome operational constraints while maintaining low fraud levels. Although it is conducted in Uganda rather than in a new location, it exemplifies how pilot projects can function as operational processes to improve cost-effectiveness and may inform similar efforts when entering new markets.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Such a program would be donor-funded while new systems were being put in place and while operational problems were being solved; then, if the program were successful, GiveDirectly could pass it to the government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains the operational process behind pilot projects: using donor funding to address initial challenges (e.g., establishing new systems and solving operational problems) before transferring the program to a government. This transition suggests how the pilot phase works to enhance cost-effectiveness by mitigating early risks and setting the stage for a sustainable, lower-cost government-managed program.

- **Quote:** A program in Kenya serving orphans and vulnerable children began as a two-year UNICEF pilot project funded with $10 million from donors. At the end of the two years, UNICEF transferred the project to the Kenyan government, which has spent $30 million on it over 4 years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of a pilot project being used as an operational test phase in a new setting. The project's progression—from a donor-funded pilot to a government-run initiative—illustrates how the initial pilot serves to demonstrate viability, ultimately enhancing cost-effectiveness by enabling the government to take over long-term operations.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** A single campaign (not a rolling campaign) is planned in Uganda, as a 'payments pilot'. This will be designed to learn about the different payment systems that could be used for transfers; the focus on learning about payments will slow the program down. After it is completed, GiveDirectly hopes to begin rolling enrollments in Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly uses a pilot project when entering a new location (Uganda) to experiment with various payment systems. The pilot functions as an operational process that allows the charity to test and determine the most effective payment method, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness before scaling up the program.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly plans to begin using Segovia in Uganda at some point in 2015, although an exact date has not been chosen. The exact date of the rollout in Uganda will depend on whether or not Segovia is suitable for the payments pilot.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reinforces the role of the pilot project by linking the rollout of a new system (Segovia) in Uganda to the outcomes of the payments pilot. It shows that the decision to deploy new operational systems—and thereby potentially improve cost-effectiveness—is contingent on the success and suitability demonstrated during the pilot phase.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly is implementing pilot projects—in the form of benchmarking experiments—when entering a new location (Rwanda). By testing cash transfers against alternative interventions, the organization appears to be using these pilots to assess which model may offer the most efficient use of resources, thereby potentially enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2012.md
- **Quote:** From March 2009-July 2012 IPA launched multiple pilots of chlorine dispenser programs. In these pilots, IPA has partnered with a variety of government institutions, as well as explored different models of dispensers and approaches to supply chain management, promotion efforts, forms of delivery, and getting the buy in of the people involved.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the use of pilot projects to test diverse operational models and partnerships. By experimenting with different methods before a full-scale rollout, the charity refines its process to select the most promising and efficient approach—an operational step that can enhance cost-effectiveness when entering new locations.

- **Quote:** DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%, and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity uses pilot projects to evaluate performance (evidenced by varied adoption rates) and then scales up the most effective models. This iterative testing and scaling process is indicative of an operational strategy aimed at achieving cost-effectiveness by focusing resources on the best-performing interventions.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2014.md
- **Quote:** Both villages had been part of GiveDirectly's first campaign in Uganda (the 'Uganda pilot').
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly identifies that the intervention in these villages was a pilot project, which relates to the research question by indicating that GiveDirectly initiated its operations in Uganda with a pilot, serving as an initial test of its processes in a new location.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes an operational procedure implemented during the pilot that enhances cost-effectiveness by reducing logistical costs for recipients. Although it does not explicitly link to the pilot, it demonstrates a tested process aimed at operational efficiency, implicitly reflecting how pilot projects can refine costly operations when entering a new area.

### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** At the time of the study, eligibility was determined by living in a house with a thatched (rather than metal) roof. Such households were identified through a census conducted with the help of the village elder.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that leverages local knowledge—by involving village elders in identifying eligible households—thereby enhancing local partner capabilities. Using locally informed selection methods can reduce search and administrative costs, which contributes to the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** GD’s operating model has changed since the time of the study. Eligibility is now based not only on a census conducted with a village guide, but is additionally verified by physical back-checks, data back-checks, and crowd-sourced labor to confirm recipient identity and thatched‐roof ownership.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details enhancements in operational processes, employing multiple layers of local verification that likely strengthen the capabilities of local partners. Such rigorous and locally-driven verification processes can reduce errors and inefficiencies, thus lowering operational costs and enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Do you implement the program yourself or partner with other organizations? We manage the transfer process from end-to-end ourselves and do not outsource any parts of it to other organizations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly chooses to conduct its cash transfer process entirely in-house rather than enhancing the capabilities of local partner organizations. It provides evidence—by illustrating what is not done—of the absence of processes that build local partner capacity, a factor relevant when evaluating operational approaches to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** We have uncommitted capacity to move $10.6M under the management of two new Field Directors based full-time in the field * Each Field Director (FD) has capacity to move $7M/year to new recipients * Kenya FD has 10 mo of uncommitted capacity in FY14, or $5.8M * Newly recruited [New Country] FD will begin in mid-October and have capacity of $5.0M (adjusted for 2 month apprenticeship) * COO shifts from directly managing transfers in the field to oversight and quality control of entire operation
- **Reasoning:** This quote details operational changes including the introduction of local Field Directors and a shift in leadership roles that enhance local operational capacities. Such changes are designed to boost efficiency in managing transfers, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track our costs with more granularity
- **Reasoning:** This operational process improvement enhances cost tracking, which supports better management of resources. Improved financial reporting is a critical element in identifying efficiency gains and achieving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is working to grow its network in East Africa. Having allies in the countries in which it works is helpful because they can alert GiveDirectly to potential issues and help diffuse issues that arise. Towards this goal, GiveDirectly is:
- Connecting with people in the press and politicians in the civil service who understand power dynamics in country and are generally "in the know."
- Connecting with people who are "outsiders," but have valuable expertise, such as John Githongo, who has worked on transparency and anti-corruption in East Africa.
- Actively recruiting East African figures to be involved in leadership.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process aimed at strengthening local networks and engaging individuals with on-the-ground expertise. By building these local partnerships, GiveDirectly can improve intervention efficacy and manage risks more efficiently, supporting overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has historically hired people for the Field Director positions who are highly qualified and interested in living in Africa for some years early in their careers. Because these people do not expect to live in country long-term, GiveDirectly will have to recruit for Field Directors on a fairly regular basis, which can be very time consuming. Currently, GiveDirectly is considering three candidates for two new Field Director positions. GiveDirectly is hoping to transition these positions towards people who are native to the countries in which they work and view the Field Director position as a long-term career.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process focused on building local capacity by recruiting native candidates for key roles. Strengthening local leadership can reduce recruitment challenges and improve field operations' efficiency, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Transitioned previous Ug staff members into first SFO and OM role
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process that builds local capacity by promoting local staff into key operational roles. Enhancing local capabilities in this way can reduce reliance on external resources and improve cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Procured granular census poverty data for future targeting: sublocation-level in Kenya, and parish in Uganda
- **Reasoning:** This operational improvement equips local partners with detailed, localized data, enabling more precise targeting of interventions. Enhanced targeting precision can lead to more efficient resource allocation and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Cost-benefit analysis: systematic analysis of our end-to-end field model will identify ways to increase efficiency without compromising integrity/user experience (completed by end of august)
- **Reasoning:** Although this quote does not specifically mention local partners, it highlights an operational process focused on systematically identifying efficiency gains. Such evaluations are fundamental to uncovering improvements that contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** The rollout of the Segovia system is ongoing. So far Field Directors and Project Associate (PA) have not realized the predicted time savings because they are still testing the system. During the rollout, FDs and PAs have been running existing enrollment processes in parallel with the Segovia processes intended to replace them. This has allowed staff to note differences and unexpected outcomes. Testing and refining the Segovia system over the past couple weeks has taken approximately 15% of Carolina Toth's time as well as a few hours per week for field staff members. It is vital that this testing take place, though it has taken longer than was initially estimated. Predicted time savings are expected by early November 2014.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process improvement aimed at streamlining enrollment processes for local field staff. The anticipated time savings suggest reduced labor costs and improved operational efficiency, which are key to enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A new system of payday monitors and local informants was recently introduced in Uganda. Communities nominate and vote on candidates for the cash out day monitor positions. Monitors acquire prestige through their work with GiveDirectly and the public recognition from their peers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly is strengthening local community oversight by integrating community-nominated monitors. Empowering local monitors can lower oversight costs and improve accountability, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process improvement that separates roles to enhance oversight. By decoupling complaint handling from field operations, the charity reduces risks such as fraud, indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational enhancement where increased audit frequency strengthens oversight. More frequent audits can help detect issues early, leading to more efficient use of resources and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows an operational process designed to verify intervention delivery in real time. Prompt detection of execution issues supports efficient operations and thus contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A Field Officer in Uganda was promoted to SFO to replace the SFO involved in the fraud, and an interim SFO was brought in from Kenya to work in Uganda for one month to help the Ugandan team recover.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its staffing in response to challenges by promoting local staff and temporarily reallocating expertise. Such adaptive capacity enhances local operations and helps maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement provides a comparative insight, suggesting that more streamlined and locally integrated operational processes, as seen in the Kenyan program, can lead to greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
- **Reasoning:** This quote evidences an operational process that leverages local input to set eligibility criteria. Involving the community can streamline targeting and reduce costs, indirectly enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture
- **Reasoning:** This operational procedure empowers local groups to oversee each other, enhancing accountability and reducing risks like elite capture. Such local checks can lower operational costs and contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** You may want to consider pushing harder on analyzing costs as much as you do on benefits. Evaluating cost data from the field can be tough since it requires a lot of on-the-ground context.
- **Reasoning:** While not explicitly linking operational processes to local partner capacity, this quote underscores the importance of incorporating detailed field cost data—often obtained through local channels—to inform more cost-effective interventions.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Version 2.0 of Segovia, which has fewer bugs, saves an estimated 30 minutes of Field Directors' work on each update in Uganda, for a weekly time savings of about one hour. In Kenya, where GiveDirectly is still operating on the original version but will be switching to 2.0 soon, the weekly time savings will be greater because the database is updated daily.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process improvement—upgrading the Segovia platform—that streamlines the work of Field Directors. The reduction in time spent on updates translates directly into cost savings and enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The Segovia team is now working on payments integration, which will help reduce errors, improve security, and save time.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an additional operational enhancement aimed at improving the system for local teams. Automating payments and reducing manual errors increases efficiency, thereby contributing to overall cost savings and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly likely would not undertake the work of setting up cash arms for studies due to the high costs involved, but in many places there are in-country implementing partners that could execute a cash transfer arm if they had the necessary funding.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly recognizes local implementing partners as potential resources for executing cash transfers, suggesting that leveraging local capacity can be a cost-effective alternative to building new systems.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process where GiveDirectly enhances intervention delivery by partnering with local institutions and refining a distributed cashout model. This adaptation leverages local capabilities to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where GiveDirectly leverages local community members as monitors. By empowering community oversight, the organization can reduce fraud and errors, indirectly enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient's phone after the recipient passed away.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another operational process where GiveDirectly draws on local informants to monitor intervention delivery. Utilizing local knowledge in this way improves reliability and helps maintain cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:
  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.
  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly leverages local resources to overcome infrastructure challenges. By engaging both established mobile agents and local informal agents, the process can lower costs and improve efficiency, contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md

- **Reasoning:** This list of operational objectives demonstrates efforts to systematize and optimize field activities. Improving performance evaluation and streamlining processes are intended to boost efficiency, thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored

Modification    Potential benefit    Potential cost    Sizing implications
Eliminate "paydays"    1.0% efficiency gain    Higher travel costs    Minimum scale of one village (200 recipients)
Use bank (vs telco) as payments vendor    1.3% efficiency gain    FD time required to build/manage    Likely need 1K+ recipients to make partnership
Use biometric authentication    &   Lower risks of certain frauds    1.1% efficiency loss for 1.5M campaign 1    Need 0.5K recipients for 99% chance of
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt details proposed modifications to the Uganda payments protocol. Although it does not directly mention local partner capacity, refining payment processes is an operational adjustment that can yield efficiency gains and improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** It will also enable GiveDirectly to employ field staff full time and have them relocate for the job, rather than offering temporary employment and paying for travel and accommodations during the working period. Full time positions make it easier for GiveDirectly to retain its best staff members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a shift to full-time employment for field staff, an operational process that enhances local capacity and reduces costs associated with temporary staffing and travel.

- **Quote:** Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how leveraging local community input for household classification can lower costs compared to traditional census methods, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness through improved operational processes.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Ms. Mukhopadhyay spends about 60% of her time on "core ops," which refers to non-campaign-specific work like organization building, technology, legal compliance, and networking.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores an operational focus on building internal processes. While not explicitly about local partner capacity, such improvements can indirectly support effective field operations and contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Forming partnerships with government officials has the benefit of expediting the government approvals process and possibly leveraging public funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process—partnering with local government officials—that streamlines approvals and may provide additional resources, thereby enhancing efficiency and supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that in Kenya it is important to maintain relationships with government officials at the county and district levels; district commissioners introduce GiveDirectly to chiefs, and chiefs introduce GiveDirectly to village elders.
- **Reasoning:** This statement illustrates the strategic use of local networks and relationships as an operational tool to facilitate smoother intervention processes. Engaging local structures helps reduce logistical challenges and supports cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there are 9 villages, and GiveDirectly was able to put them all through the national ID registration process within 1 month, so that 90% of eligible households were ready to receive transfers when payments started. (The remaining households will receive their transfers on a delayed schedule, once they complete registration.)
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages local partners and community structures to efficiently complete national ID registrations. Rapid registration reduces delays and administrative overhead, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A challenge of backchecks is that field officers often end up teaching recipients how to use their cell phones and mobile money accounts, so that they can access their money and are less likely to be scammed. Field officers will teach recipients how to check their balance and distinguish messages that say they received money from other messages. Field officers will sometimes write out instructions for recipients in the local language that describe step-by-step how to operate the phones and mobile money accounts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where local field officers incorporate training into backchecks. Enhancing recipients' understanding of mobile money reduces errors and fraud, thereby improving efficiency and contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** One of the difficulties of running a cash transfer program is ensuring that all recipients are given a consistent and accurate message about the program. Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached. Once GiveDirectly is confident that its field staff are delivering a consistent message, it may be interested in varying that message to emphasize different elements, such as encouraging long-term investments versus not giving any advice on how funds should be spent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that ties field staff compensation to communication effectiveness. Linking performance to outcomes can drive more efficient interventions and thus indirectly support cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation. GiveDirectly is pursuing both structural and operational questions for future research. While we want to maximize our experimentation and testing, any additional steps we add increase the complexity of the operations that our staff have to manage, so that is a consideration.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the value of experimenting with operational procedures—specifically a new system for field staff compensation—that impact efficiency and service quality. Although it adds complexity, such innovations can enhance local operational capability and contribute to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** Field staff now work continuously, year-round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before. GiveDirectly told us that it is pleased by the pace at which new recipients have been enrolled under the rolling model, and that field staff appreciate that this model has enabled them to have much longer-term employment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational shift to a rolling model that provides continuous work and longer-term employment for field staff. This increased stability and efficiency can reduce overheads and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that the Segovia product will fully automate the data management from enrollment to payment. GiveDirectly expects that this technology product will result in significant efficiency gains and quality improvement.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how automating data management processes bolsters the operational capabilities of field staff. The anticipated efficiency gains and quality improvements translate into reduced costs, contributing to the charity’s overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly now estimates that each Field Director will be able to manage about $7 million/year in transfer costs, while its previous estimate was $5 million/year. GiveDirectly explains that this estimate has risen partly due to improved digital data collection enabling an increase in the pace at which transfer campaigns progress, and partly because it has expanded its senior local staff, which gives the Field Director greater leverage to oversee a larger amount of money.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links operational improvements—enhanced digital data collection and expanded local senior staff—with an increased capacity of Field Directors. Managing higher transfer volumes more efficiently directly contributes to improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** In early 2016, GiveDirectly allocated a fairly large sum of money to test a new implementation model in Kenya. A separate field director and team were hired approximately six months ago, and the experiment is taking place in an area close to GiveDirectly's other field operations. The primary aim is to double the program's size in 2017 without significantly increasing the management structure. The new model seeks to increase throughput per manager by eliminating the token payment and back check steps. GiveDirectly will assess gains in throughput as well as costs, which might occur in the areas of comprehension and fraud. Results and data should be available after a few months of disbursements. By the end of 2016, GiveDirectly hopes to have a blueprint for implementing a similar model in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process change designed to streamline intervention steps and enhance local team capacity. By increasing throughput while controlling management costs, the new model is intended to improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** High refusal rates primarily impact the productivity of census teams; for example, if 50% of households refuse registration, the team must replace them with new households. In order to continue to reach enrollment targets in Kenya, GiveDirectly has provided additional support by increasing census team sizes and adjusting team members' locations.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that when challenges arise, GiveDirectly boosts the capacity of its local census teams by increasing their size and optimizing team placement. Such adjustments improve operational efficiency and can lead to lower per-intervention costs.

- **Quote:** In its Uganda program, it has successfully tested a 'cash-out' model. Recipients and agents were able to overcome liquidity constraints, and in Uganda, GiveDirectly distributes $700,000 to $1 million per month without any increases in fraud.
- **Reasoning:** Although this quote does not explicitly mention local partners, it describes an operational innovation—the cash-out model—that leverages local agents to manage disbursements efficiently while maintaining low fraud levels, thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's operational expertise is particularly valuable in its work with governments.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly leverages its operational expertise in working with local government partners. Such collaborative processes can build capacity and, over time, lead to more cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** For example, GiveDirectly could offer several million dollars and early management assistance to encourage a government to try cash transfers. Such a program would be donor-funded while new systems were being put in place and while operational problems were being solved; then, if the program were successful, GiveDirectly could pass it to the government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a planned operational process where GiveDirectly supports a government partner to build local capacity. By addressing operational challenges before transitioning the program, the process aims to set up a cost-effective government-run intervention.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** Several metrics are being tracked to determine what difference Segovia has made to GiveDirectly's operations. One important metric is the time saved by FDs; FDs are informally keeping track of these timesavings and how they are using their increased capacity. Given that FD time is a significant cost for GiveDirectly, being able to put a dollar value onto the time saved by Segovia will give a strong indication of whether or not the system is useful.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links the deployment of the Segovia system—a key operational process—with measurable time savings for Field Directors, a significant cost factor. Quantifying these savings provides clear evidence of how such processes enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process of capacity building in Rwanda. Improved registration and faster team hiring contribute to streamlined operations, which can, in turn, reduce costs and support overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2012.md
- **Quote:** Attendees of this meeting elect a person from the village to be the official chlorine dispenser promoter by show of hands or secret ballot. The promoters are charged with refilling dispensers with the chlorine supplies that DSW delivers, ensuring the dispenser is in working order, communicating any issues to DSW staff, and reaching out to people to encourage them to use the dispenser.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process whereby responsibility is delegated to a community-elected local promoter. Empowering local community members in this manner builds capacity and can reduce costs, thereby supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that by leveraging local resources and community expertise, the charity can reduce external costs and improve efficiency, which indirectly contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2014.md
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process—coordinated cash out days—that addresses local infrastructure limitations and reduces transportation costs, thereby enhancing intervention efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights planning and coordination activities led by local field staff. Such operational measures ensure smooth execution of cash transfers, reducing logistical inefficiencies and supporting cost effectiveness.

## Code: Securing local buy-in: Ensuring support for the charity’s intervention among local stakeholders.
### Doc Name: Receipient feedback example 2020.md
- **Quote:** In my opinion, GiveDirectly sends money right to my phone without having to use other middlemen. like the government and other organizations do. This program has been implemented within a very short time that allowed me to timely implement my ideas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process of direct cash transfers that bypass intermediaries, suggesting reduced overhead and increased responsiveness. Although the statement does not explicitly mention mechanisms for ensuring local stakeholder support, the beneficiary’s positive evaluation implies that such streamlined processes may enhance local trust and acceptance, thereby potentially contributing to the charity’s overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** At the time of the study, eligibility was determined by living in a house with a thatched (rather than metal) roof. Such households were identified through a census conducted with the help of the village elder.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages local stakeholder support—specifically, the use of village elders in identifying eligible households. By relying on trusted local figures, the program likely benefits from improved targeting efficiency and reduced administrative costs, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have no data on how transfers were perceived by the households; anecdotally, because GD worked with village elders, had objectively verifiable targeting criteria, and was otherwise highly transparent, we have reason to believe that recipients had accurate beliefs about the nature of the transfers as fully unconditional and one-time.
- **Reasoning:** This quote suggests that the involvement of local stakeholders, such as village elders, along with transparent and verifiable targeting criteria, built trust among recipients. This trust and clarity can reduce miscommunication or errors in delivery, indirectly lowering operational costs and enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Typically, very positively. We take our relationships with local government seriously, obtaining the necessary approvals at each level from national governments down to village leaders. We also find that GiveDirectly tends to make voters happy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process wherein GiveDirectly actively engages local government and community leaders to secure stakeholder support. Such support can streamline operations and reduce administrative friction, which in turn has the potential to enhance the cost-effectiveness of their charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** * County-level government approval equivalent to ~70 K additional eligible households in Siaya and Homa Bay counties
- **Reasoning:** This bullet explicitly shows that local stakeholder support is operationalized through obtaining approval from county-level government authorities. The increased number of eligible households as a result suggests that integrating local stakeholder engagement into the operational process may enhance scale and contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Before launching a campaign, GiveDirectly secures the buy-in of Chiefs, who are elected to work at the regional level, presiding over Sub-Chiefs and Village Elders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process through which GiveDirectly actively engages local government figures (Chiefs) to secure stakeholder support prior to program implementation. While it does not explicitly state cost-effectiveness outcomes, involving local leaders can lead to improved accountability and smoother operations, which are key factors in enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is working to grow its network in East Africa. Having allies in the countries in which it works is helpful because they can alert GiveDirectly to potential issues and help diffuse issues that arise. Towards this goal, GiveDirectly is:
- Connecting with people in the press and politicians in the civil service who understand power dynamics in country and are generally "in the know."
- Connecting with people who are "outsiders," but have valuable expertise, such as John Githongo, who has worked on transparency and anti-corruption in East Africa.
- Actively recruiting East African figures to be involved in leadership.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt details another operational process focused on building a strong local network. By cultivating relationships with local experts, media, and civil servants, GiveDirectly is better positioned to identify and mitigate issues early, thereby potentially avoiding costly disruptions and inefficiencies. This proactive local engagement indirectly contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of their interventions.

- **Quote:** When GiveDirectly staff discover that a Village Elder has attempted to solicit bribes from recipients, the Field Director in that country reports the issue to the presiding Chief. GiveDirectly does not report Village Elders to the police or press charges, and it does not have the authority to remove Village Elders from their positions, though Chiefs do have this authority. There have been four cases in which Chiefs have removed Village Elders from their positions because of issues that GiveDirectly reported. (GiveDirectly has worked in approximately 120 villages total; each with one Village Elder). GiveDirectly has spoken with recipients in villages where the Village Elder was removed and with one of the replacement Village Elders, all of who expressed joy with the change. Power and corruption are huge issues in development, so it's possible that one of the greatest impacts GiveDirectly can have is in reporting Village Elders who are corrupt.
- **Reasoning:** This narrative illustrates how GiveDirectly leverages local stakeholder mechanisms — specifically, the authority of Chiefs over Village Elders — to address corruption within their operational framework. Preventing and addressing corrupt practices can reduce inefficiencies and unexpected costs, thus indirectly supporting the cost-effectiveness of the charity's interventions.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates direct local stakeholder feedback in the operational process. It shows that community members prefer a more direct engagement method, highlighting how local stakeholder input is factored into intervention design—a key aspect when considering how such processes might affect cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations). May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs. Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict. Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines the operational trade-offs associated with incorporating community-based targeting. It quantifies the potential additional costs per household when adjusting procedures to incorporate local stakeholder input, thereby directly engaging with the research question regarding the influence of such processes on overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Permission can be granted after a single meeting or take much longer, depending on resistance from local officials.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process involving local government approvals. It highlights that the speed and predictability of securing local stakeholder (government) support can vary, which may impact the overall cost-effectiveness by affecting how swiftly expansion or intervention processes occur.

- **Quote:** A new system of payday monitors and local informants was recently introduced in Uganda. Communities nominate and vote on candidates for the cash out day monitor positions. Monitors acquire prestige through their work with GiveDirectly and the public recognition from their peers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that actively involves local community members in monitoring cash out procedures. Such community-driven oversight can reduce inefficiencies and potential fraud, which in turn contributes to maintaining or improving the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In the Kenyan village called Ayo A, in which there were much higher levels of gaming than is common, GiveDirectly held a community meeting to discuss the problem. At the meeting, staff told recipients that GiveDirectly would not work in areas where people are dishonest, and that it was pausing transfers until the issues were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked recipients to report any information they had about the gaming.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a process where local stakeholder engagement is used to enforce community standards and integrity. By pausing transfers and calling for internal reporting, GiveDirectly leverages community accountability, which can prevent resource wastage and enhance the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity's operations.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that leverages local stakeholders—journalists, respected farmers, and civil servants—to monitor and safeguard the program. Although the connection to cost–effectiveness is indirect, such local oversight can help prevent fraud and misallocation of resources, thereby contributing to improved overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government's formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly's work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly's recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly's work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it. GiveDirectly worked with a person in the office of the president in Nairobi who may be a useful contact for GiveDirectly in the future.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational decision to engage with local governmental stakeholders by selectively collaborating and managing information sharing. By protecting recipient privacy and aligning with government protocols, GiveDirectly mitigates political risks and maintains trust with local stakeholders, which can indirectly protect the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its operations.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** It is also working to obtain permission from local government officials to conduct transfers in another county from which villages will be drawn to participate in the study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that actively seeks local stakeholder (government) support. Securing local government approval can help ensure smoother program implementation and reduce obstacles or costs associated with regulatory or community resistance, thereby potentially contributing to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** When it is reported to GiveDirectly that a household is in disagreement about how to use the transfer funds, GiveDirectly's standard protocol is to suspend transfers until the household has resolved the issue and either have a staff member help arbitrate the case or ask the village elder to do so.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a process that leverages local stakeholders—specifically, village elders—to resolve intra-household conflicts. Involving trusted local figures can mitigate disputes quickly, preventing costly escalation and disruptions, which is relevant to improving overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Developed and is currently in the process of rolling out an additional detection mechanism in which GiveDirectly calls village elders at key points in the process to ask about adverse events, because they are likely to hear about issues and may feel more of an obligation to report them.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process engages local stakeholders by using village elders for early detection of adverse events. Timely identification and resolution of issues can help prevent expensive complications, indirectly supporting better cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that directly involves local stakeholders by holding village meetings to capture community preferences. Such engagement is intended to align the intervention with local needs, which can improve targeting efficiency and potentially contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In a separate meeting, community split into groups and categorized households according to housing materials
- **Reasoning:** This operational process highlights another method of stakeholder involvement where community members actively participate in categorizing households. This approach is aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness, which may reduce errors and resource misallocation, thereby indirectly boosting cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an additional layer of community-led verification which minimizes the risk of elite capture. By using local stakeholder groups to cross-check decisions, the process helps ensure that interventions are well-targeted and resource allocation is efficient, contributing to cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** One of the objectives of one of GiveDirectly's studies is to test various transfer schedules, to learn about recipients' preferences and whether different transfer schedules affect outcomes. For example, the study includes an "early group" (who get a token payment 30 days before being asked about their timing preferences) and a "late group" (who get a token payment five days before being asked for their timing preferences). It is possible that getting a payment soon before making a decision about when to receive the rest of the transfer could lead to recipients making better decisions because they have still have cash on hand from the previous transfer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is actively engaging local stakeholders (the recipients) by testing transfer schedules based on their preferences. This operational process of gathering direct input has the potential to improve decision-making and ultimately enhance cost-effectiveness by ensuring interventions are better aligned with beneficiary needs.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is tracking costs related to the study and trying to determine whether the effort to change its transfer schedule based on recipient preferences would be worth the benefit to recipients. This change would entail calling recipients to elicit their timing preferences, which would be a new step in GiveDirectly's process, so the cost of the calls would need to be compared to recipients' outcomes.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links the operational process of incorporating recipient (local stakeholder) input with a cost-effectiveness analysis. By comparing the costs of eliciting preferences to the benefits received by the recipients, GiveDirectly is assessing whether this stakeholder-supported process improves overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** To help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipient whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an operational process that leverages local stakeholder involvement—through trusted community members acting as trustees—to facilitate cash transfers. By incorporating local validation, the process minimizes risks such as theft and reduces administrative costs, suggesting a contribution to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process involving local government stakeholders. The efficient and rapid approval process suggests that engaging local stakeholders can streamline enrollment procedures, reducing delays and associated costs—factors that likely enhance the overall cost-effectiveness of the program.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that directly involves local stakeholders by engaging community members as monitors. By incorporating local oversight into the cash out process, GiveDirectly aims to prevent fraud and ensure proper fund delivery, which can indirectly contribute to the overall cost-effectiveness of their interventions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates another operational process that leverages local stakeholder support—organizing community meetings and encouraging community reporting to address issues like gaming. Such engagement helps identify and resolve implementation challenges, potentially reducing misallocation of resources and improving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** In some cases, community members are led by local religious leaders or local government to mistrust the program. In Siaya County, this issue did not arise, possibly because GiveDirectly covered such a large portion of the county that in any new area it entered, people were already aware of the program and knew that it was trustworthy. GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program's purpose.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly actively engages with local stakeholders (local government, religious leaders, and local media) to build trust in the program. Although it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, ensuring local support can lead to better program uptake and more efficient use of resources, which are key to improving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly incorporates local stakeholder feedback (from focus groups) into its operational processes by adjusting targeting criteria. By aligning the intervention with local needs and perspectives, the organization may improve its allocation of resources, thereby indirectly contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md
- **Quote:** Aside from full-time staff, GiveDirectly also employs project-based staff: accountants, field workers who do surveys, and field workers who check that recipient households meet GiveDirectly's criteria. The field workers are supervised by the full-time staff; the current staff member is based in Kenya.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where GiveDirectly utilizes local human resources (e.g., field workers based in Kenya) to verify eligibility and conduct surveys. Such localized staffing can be understood as a mechanism to secure local stakeholder support, which in turn may enhance cost-effectiveness by ensuring that interventions are effectively tailored and efficiently implemented.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly carries out its own surveys of the recipients of cash transfers via phone calls. It successfully reached 95% of the people in its first round of enrollment and has so far reached 67% of people in its second round of enrollment. Some of the topics in the survey which recipients are asked about are: 1. Whether the cash transfers have led to conflict between recipients and non-recipients. 2. How they are using the money and how they plan to use the money. 3. Their suggestions for GiveDirectly. 4. How long it takes them to get a national identification (if necessary) and register to receive cash transfers. 5. How long it takes them to travel to collect the cash transfer and how much it costs them to do so. 6. Whether their lives have improved as a result of the cash transfers

On the first point, GiveDirectly has not yet seen evidence that the cash transfers have led to significant conflict. On the third point, the most common suggestion from recipients is that GiveDirectly allow those who receive cash transfers to receive them for a longer duration than 2 years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly actively collects and uses feedback from local beneficiaries, a key group of local stakeholders. By asking for their suggestions and assessing aspects like conflict and logistical challenges, the organization can adapt its interventions to better align with local needs, potentially reducing inefficiencies and enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that directly involves local stakeholders in the decision‐making process for targeting recipients. By incorporating community input on what best indicates poverty, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to local perspectives, which can lead to more efficient allocation of resources and thereby contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly ties local stakeholder involvement to cost savings. The use of community-based targeting not only ensures local support but also reduces operational costs compared to traditional data collection methods like a census, directly linking stakeholder-supported processes with improved cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** After the fraud was discovered, GiveDirectly staff held community meetings to communicate about what had happened. GiveDirectly decided not to reimburse the funds stolen from recipients, because it did not want to create an incentive for recipients to pretend that additional funds had been stolen in hopes of getting reimbursements.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly engaged directly with local community stakeholders following a fraud incident. By holding community meetings and deciding against reimbursements that might incentivize future fraud, the organization works to maintain trust and prevent cost escalations, which indirectly contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Forming partnerships with government officials has the benefit of expediting the government approvals process and possibly leveraging public funds. However, working with government could also politicize GiveDirectly's program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational strategy where building relationships with local government stakeholders can streamline administrative processes and tap into public funding. Such a process can reduce delays and lower costs, thereby contributing to the charity’s overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** By now, GiveDirectly understands well the process for seeking government approvals in Kenya and does not see acquiring approvals as a major risk. GiveDirectly said that in Kenya it is important to maintain relationships with government officials at the county and district levels; district commissioners introduce GiveDirectly to chiefs, and chiefs introduce GiveDirectly to village elders. GiveDirectly just received permission to work in Ukwala district in Kenya. The whole approvals process took 2 weeks from the time that Joe Huston (Kenya Field Director) met with the district commissioner to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding.
- **Reasoning:** This extended quote provides a detailed account of how GiveDirectly’s operational process of maintaining strong local relationships facilitates rapid government approval. The expedited process minimizes administrative delays and reduces risks and associated costs, which is a key factor in enhancing the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At the census stage GiveDirectly field officers visit every household in a village and collect information about them, including housing materials. Field officers bring maps that GiveDirectly has had prepared by members of the village and also find a person who lives in the village to serve as a guide and show them the boundaries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that leverages local stakeholder support—by using locally prepared maps and guides—to ensure a comprehensive census. Such engagement can enhance data accuracy and operational efficiency, which are key factors that likely contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them. GiveDirectly was able to reach 85-90% of people through these registration drives, returning IDs within about 1 week of visiting eligible households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where local stakeholder support is explicitly integrated—by involving a Local Councilperson—to approve national IDs. The involvement of local authorities likely facilitates faster and broader registration coverage, thereby reducing delays and associated costs, which supports overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Kenya, GiveDirectly experimented with a community-based targeting process, whereby residents gave input on households that they felt were deserving of transfers but had been excluded by GiveDirectly's criteria. GiveDirectly felt that to do this process well required significant resources (staff time) and that the benefits were not worth the costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the trade-off between engaging local stakeholders through a community-based targeting process and its impact on cost-effectiveness. It highlights that while local stakeholder involvement can improve targeting legitimacy, the process may incur high operational costs that undermine overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** One of the difficulties of running a cash transfer program is ensuring that all recipients are given a consistent and accurate message about the program. Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process—compensating field staff based on their communication effectiveness—to ensure that local recipients (key local stakeholders) understand the program. Ensuring accurate and consistent messaging may improve recipient engagement and support, which can contribute indirectly to cost-effectiveness by enhancing the efficiency and integrity of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation. GiveDirectly is pursuing both structural and operational questions for future research. While we want to maximize our experimentation and testing, any additional steps we add increase the complexity of the operations that our staff have to manage, so that is a consideration.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores that GiveDirectly is investing in operational procedures that shape efficiency, integrity, and the recipient (local stakeholder) experience. Although it notes a trade-off in adding complexity, the focus on improving recipient experience suggests an effort to secure local stakeholder support, which is linked to achieving overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** Field staff now work continuously, year-round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before. GiveDirectly told us that it is pleased by the pace at which new recipients have been enrolled under the rolling model, and that field staff appreciate that this model has enabled them to have much longer-term employment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process (the rolling model) that supports local stakeholders—specifically, field staff—by offering continuous, long-term employment. Such stability and local buy-in may lead to improved efficiency (e.g., reduced turnover costs and better local engagement), thereby indirectly contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly told us that it is not aware of any such issues so far, and it feels confident in its field staff managers, who have shown a high degree of commitment and have been working with GiveDirectly for a long time, and in its methods of process and data control.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights robust local management and trusted operational processes. By relying on committed, long-term local staff managers and effective data control methods, the organization minimizes risks and errors, which can improve operational efficiency and ultimately support cost-effective charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** the governance structure of the second country is more decentralized than in Kenya, which required GiveDirectly to spend slightly more time working with local authorities before starting transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly had to engage with local governmental stakeholders due to a decentralized governance structure. Such engagement is a clear example of ensuring local stakeholder support, which can influence overall cost-effectiveness by mitigating potential logistical challenges.

- **Quote:** In response, GiveDirectly has been more proactive in coordinating with the mobile money service for the transfers that have begun, for example, by giving the mobile money service advanced notice before sending the funds so that agents could be prepared. In some cases, agents traveled to the villages in which recipients live to reduce recipient travel time.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational process aimed at securing the support of local service providers. By coordinating proactively with the mobile money service, GiveDirectly ensures a smoother cash transfer process, which can reduce delays and inefficiencies, thereby contributing indirectly to the cost-effectiveness of its interventions.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly created an outreach team to focus on this issue, which has been operating for three months. The team is employing a variety of different tactics: for example, it is communicating with relevant community stakeholders and using media to disseminate recipient testimonial videos and other materials.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where GiveDirectly actively engages local community stakeholders in response to high refusal rates. By reaching out and communicating effectively, the organization aims to reduce refusals, thereby minimizing the extra costs associated with re-enrollment and inefficiencies—an indirect contribution to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly adheres to the necessary registration and reporting requirements and makes efforts to keep all levels of government informed of its activities. For example, it recently met with Kenya's Principal Secretary of Labour.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a process designed to secure local government support, an important stakeholder in the charity intervention. Maintaining transparent and regular communication with government officials can mitigate regulatory risks and streamline operations, which can lead to smoother, more cost-effective program execution.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_and_Paul_Niehaus_02-05-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's operational expertise is particularly valuable in its work with governments.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the organization’s reliance on well-developed operational processes to effectively engage local government stakeholders. By leveraging this operational expertise, GiveDirectly can secure local support—a factor that is likely to improve the intervention's implementation and contribute to cost-effectiveness through better local alignment.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly could offer several million dollars and early management assistance to encourage a government to try cash transfers. Such a program would be donor-funded while new systems were being put in place and while operational problems were being solved; then, if the program were successful, GiveDirectly could pass it to the government.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a concrete operational process where early financial and managerial support is provided to a government to initiate a cash transfer program. The planned transition of the program to government operation demonstrates how securing local stakeholder buy-in through these processes can potentially reduce long-term costs, thereby enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Partnerships in the evaluation and founding of programs could result from: GiveDirectly approaching organizations and governments that are new to cash transfers to discuss possible partnerships. Organizations and governments approaching GiveDirectly to discuss possible partnerships. GiveDirectly could facilitate the development of this kind of demand by making known that if organizations or governments want to try cash transfers, it could help.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational approach that actively seeks to foster partnerships with local entities. By initiating and nurturing dialogue with local stakeholders, GiveDirectly is working to ensure that interventions are tailored to local needs and capacities, a process that can ultimately lead to more sustainable and cost-effective program outcomes.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments). GiveDirectly hopes, however, that the benchmarks it sets in terms of operational efficiency and excellence will set the bar for what other cash transfer programs, including government-led ones, should be able to achieve.
- **Reasoning:** This passage contrasts the potential benefits of local government partnerships with the risks of losing operational control. It underscores that while local stakeholder support (through government partnerships) is considered, maintaining strict operational processes is essential for ensuring high implementation standards and cost-effectiveness. This decision to avoid complete reliance on local governmental control suggests that carefully managed stakeholder engagement is pivotal to preserving the organization’s cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process in Rwanda where GiveDirectly must coordinate closely with a key local stakeholder—the president's office—to meet regulatory requirements. The smooth registration and quicker hiring process suggest that such operational alignment with local authorities may streamline implementation and contribute indirectly to overall cost-effectiveness by reducing delays and administrative obstacles.

- **Quote:** 1,800 of the most vulnerable 14-30 year olds in 120 villages in two districts were selected by AVSI and community leaders to participate in WINGS' two phases.190
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that explicitly involves local stakeholders—in this case, community leaders—in the beneficiary selection process. Although the text does not directly detail the connection between this local stakeholder participation and cost-effectiveness outcomes, the involvement of community leaders can be inferred to enhance legitimacy and targeting accuracy, which are factors that may improve overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2012.md
- **Quote:** Meet with local leaders (e.g., church leaders, village elders) to discuss the possibility of installing dispensers. These officials provide lists of all water points in the areas they represent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes an operational process that involves engaging local stakeholders. By collaborating with local leaders to identify water points, the intervention leverages local knowledge and networks, which can streamline site selection and potentially reduce costs, thus contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Host community meetings in areas that DSW has selected. The meeting is advertised by calling village elders, posting notices, announcements by megaphone, and by meeting with a couple villagers initially and asking them to tell others about the meeting. Community meetings serve to sensitize the community members to the program and inform them of the benefits of chlorine, as well as to ask if they are ready to have the program (to formally secure their buy in).
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a key process aimed at securing community buy-in. The community meetings ensure that local stakeholders are informed and supportive of the intervention, which is critical for sustained usage and maintenance. This local ownership can lead to improved uptake and longer-term sustainability, indirectly enhancing cost-effectiveness by reducing the need for costly repeated interventions or external oversight.

- **Quote:** DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the operational process incorporates local contributions directly into the implementation. By obtaining in-kind support from the community, the organization reduces material and labor costs, thus contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2014.md
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that leverages local arrangements (cash out days) to minimize additional transportation costs. By reducing these costs, the process indirectly enhances the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention, reflecting how local stakeholder engagement can lower operational expenses.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates the careful coordination and pre-planning with local stakeholders—recipients and mobile money agents—to ensure a smooth cash withdrawal process. Such operational procedures can improve efficiency and reduce administrative or logistic costs, contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the charitable intervention.

- **Quote:** Newly recruited [New Country] FD will begin in mid-October and have capacity of $5.0M (adjusted for 2 month apprenticeship)
- **Reasoning:** This quote hints at a training process through the mention of a '2 month apprenticeship,' implying that new staff undergo a period of skill development. However, the text does not elaborate further on how this training process contributes to cost effectiveness, offering only limited evidence relevant to the research question.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** Transitioned previous Ug staff members into first SFO and OM role
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the organization is developing its existing local staff by transitioning them into new, higher-level roles (SFO and OM). Such internal capacity building can reduce costs associated with external hiring and improve operational efficiency, which in turn contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Scorecards enable us to better manage, track, and incentivize good staff performance
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights the use of performance management tools that monitor and motivate staff performance. By incentivizing good performance, the organization likely enhances skill development and operational efficiency, linking workforce improvements to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly recently hired Lawrence Juma to serve in a new role it has added to its Kenya staff: Project Associate. This role is responsible for directly managing and coaching field staff and overseeing data collection, which will alleviate these responsibilities from the Kenya Field Director. Mr. Juma was previously involved in project management at Innovations for Poverty Action.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly’s effort to improve the skills of its local workforce by introducing a dedicated role for coaching and managing field staff. By providing direct support and oversight, the organization is investing in the training and capacity building of its staff, which can lead to more efficient operations and contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It will also enable GiveDirectly to employ field staff full time and have them relocate for the job, rather than offering temporary employment and paying for travel and accommodations during the working period. Full time positions make it easier for GiveDirectly to retain its best staff members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how creating full-time positions for field staff supports staff retention and continuity. Retaining well-trained, skilled staff reduces the costs associated with temporary employment and repeated training, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly developed a system to evaluate field staff performance, using data on productivity and quality of work combined with subjective measures of teamwork and cooperation, as assessed by field staff supervisors. The system will generate monthly "scores" for each field staff member. GiveDirectly is not going to reduce the baseline salaries that it offers to staff, but it will offer bonuses to those with the highest performance scores. The evaluation system has been well received in concept by GiveDirectly field staff; it is about to be implemented for the first time in Kenya.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an initiative to monitor and incentivize staff performance, which indirectly serves as a mechanism for continual skill improvement. By rewarding high performance, the system encourages staff to enhance their capabilities, improve efficiency, and reduce errors, all of which can lead to more cost effective operations.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached. Once GiveDirectly is confident that its field staff are delivering a consistent message, it may be interested in varying that message to emphasize different elements, such as encouraging long-term investments versus not giving any advice on how funds should be spent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational strategy aimed at improving the effectiveness of field staff—a process that involves incentivizing and potentially training staff to communicate more effectively. Although it does not explicitly connect these improvements to cost-effectiveness, the implication is that better-trained and more effective field staff can enhance efficiency and reliable delivery of services, which in turn could contribute to making charitable operations more cost effective.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has expanded its staff to build capacity for current and future transfer campaigns. It has hired one Field Director and is in the process of hiring a second. It has hired 3 Senior Field Officers and plans to hire 1-3 more. It has hired a full team of about 30 Field Officers in Kenya and a smaller team in the second country, which it plans to expand.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is actively investing in workforce capacity by expanding its team. Although it does not explicitly detail training programs or skill-improvement initiatives, expanding staffing can be seen as part of a broader capacity-building process. This supports the idea that enhancing local workforce capabilities—even if implied through hiring and capacity building—can contribute to improved operational effectiveness and potentially lower operational costs.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly now estimates that each Field Director will be able to manage about $7 million/year in transfer costs, while its previous estimate was $5 million/year. GiveDirectly explains that this estimate has risen partly due to improved digital data collection enabling an increase in the pace at which transfer campaigns progress, and partly because it has expanded its senior local staff, which gives the Field Director greater leverage to oversee a larger amount of money.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the increase in a Field Director’s capacity to manage transfer costs to improvements in both technology (improved digital data collection) and the strengthening of the local workforce (expanded senior local staff). While the passage does not detail specific training processes, the reference to expanded local staff suggests that improving workforce skills and managerial capacity is instrumental in boosting cost effectiveness by increasing the funds handled per Field Director.

## Code: Intra-intervention monitoring: Monitoring the charity’s intervention during its implementation.
### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** GD then repeated the census in treatment villages to confirm that all households deemed eligible by the research team were in fact eligible. The final eligible sample was the overlap between the households that completed baseline and GD's census exercise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a monitoring step incorporated during implementation whereby GD verifies household eligibility via a repeated census. Such verification minimizes errors in targeting—ensuring that resources reach the intended beneficiaries—and thereby contributes to more efficient, cost–effective operations.

- **Quote:** Recipients were visited by a representative of GD, who announced the transfer, including amount and timing.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt highlights the operational process of direct field visits to deliver clear information about the intervention. By monitoring delivery through personal contact, the charity helps ensure that the intervention is understood and executed correctly, a process that can reduce miscommunication and administrative errors, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We therefore hired two graduate students to audit the data and code for this study. They were compensated on an hourly basis and paid a bonus for any errors they identified.
- **Reasoning:** Although focused on auditing research data, this quote exemplifies a rigorous external monitoring practice. Such systematic audits enhance transparency and accountability in the intervention’s evaluation—which provides an operational model that, if applied during implementation, could improve error detection and overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** We address the second through identity-matching between our records and those of our payment providers, through comprehensive follow-up calls to ensure money is reaching the intended recipients, and in some cases through direct staff monitoring of cash-out points.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the specific monitoring methods applied during implementation—such as follow-up calls and direct staff monitoring—to ensure that transfers reach the intended recipients. Such monitoring is integral to operational processes that prevent fraud and diversion, thereby enhancing the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Second, imposing conditions requires costly monitoring and enforcement structures be put in place. One detailed estimate put the administrative costs of a conditional cash transfer scheme as high as 63% of the transfers made over the first three years of the program (Caldes, Natalia, and John Maluccio. "The Costs of Conditional Cash Transfers." Journal of International Development 17 pp. 151-168, 2005). Our read of the existing experimental evidence comparing the impact of conditional to unconditional transfers is that there is little evidence to suggest these added costs produce commensurate benefits.
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains the trade-off associated with monitoring in conditional transfer programs. By highlighting how additional monitoring and enforcement could cost up to 63% of the transfer value, it underscores why GiveDirectly opts for unconditional transfers. This decision minimizes monitoring costs and thereby improves the cost effectiveness of its operational processes during implementation.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** We are adapting our financial reporting systems to track our costs with more granularity
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity is enhancing its monitoring processes by improving cost tracking during implementation, which is an operational adjustment aimed at improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** COO shifts from directly managing transfers in the field to oversight and quality control of entire operation
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates a shift in operational processes towards stronger oversight and quality control—a form of monitoring during implementation—that can contribute to enhanced cost effectiveness by ensuring efficient resource management.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Kenya rolling campaign increased speed, with smaller campaigns driving learning in both Kenya and Uganda
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that alongside a larger campaign, smaller, monitored interventions are implemented in parallel to generate real-time learning. The learning gained from these activities can be used to fine-tune operational processes, which may ultimately enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Smaller "design lab" projects (ideas42, index insurance, targeting project) occur either in parallel to rolling campaign or are folded into its operational flow
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that experimental projects are integrated within the overall implementation. The use of these pilot, monitored projects suggests that data and insights collected during implementation feed directly into operational adjustments that could improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Results from ongoing studies will become available over the next 2 years, with smaller studies concluding sooner
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects an ongoing monitoring effort where studies are continuously evaluated. The emerging results from these studies are likely to inform operational decisions, thereby potentially contributing to more cost-effective processes.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has laid off a few field staff for dishonesty or cheating; for example, one field staff person did some work on a Saturday but claimed that he had done it on a Monday. This was a case where digital data collection helped GiveDirectly increase accountability (because there was a time stamp marking the date the work had been completed).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how monitoring through digital data collection during implementation (using time stamps) helps identify and correct misreporting. Such accountability measures are integral to operational processes that prevent inefficiencies, thereby indirectly enhancing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Call people regularly after transfers. GiveDirectly currently calls people after every installment of a transfer; if the recipient has been the victim of a crime, GiveDirectly can pause the transfers until the issue is addressed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an active monitoring approach where regular follow-up calls are used to detect issues (such as crime affecting recipients) during implementation. By pausing transfers when problems are identified, the charity is able to make real-time operational adjustments that safeguard resources and contribute to cost-effective functioning.

- **Quote:** When GiveDirectly staff discover that a Village Elder has attempted to solicit bribes from recipients, the Field Director in that country reports the issue to the presiding Chief.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a monitoring mechanism where staff are vigilant about corrupt practices during implementation. By reporting issues like bribery promptly, the organization institutes corrective actions that help maintain the integrity and efficiency of its operations, thus supporting overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplymentary material.md
- **Quote:** We continue to track expenses closely, including changes in our cost structure as we scale
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization actively monitors its financial metrics during the intervention, allowing for timely adjustments in operational processes that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Implemented standardized operational reporting on a weekly and monthly basis (which we will walk through together now)
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of regular monitoring practices during implementation, using standardized reporting to track operations and identify process improvements that support cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** **Smarter audits:** qualitative and quantitative analysis of our audit data will identify "high-risk" recipient profiles and enable us to use a more probabilistic approach of generating audit flags (completed by end of July)
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the use of comprehensive audits serves as a monitoring tool during implementation, helping to pinpoint high-risk areas and refine operational strategies to better allocate resources and reduce waste.

- **Quote:** **Cost-benefit analysis:** systematic analysis of our end-to-end field model will identify ways to increase efficiency without compromising integrity/user experience (completed by end of august)
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly connects the process of monitoring through cost-benefit analysis with the goal of uncovering efficiencies in the operational model, thereby contributing to enhanced cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Michael_Cooke_04-17-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** Dr. Cooke's day-to-day work involves calls and follow-up work with research PIs, IPA, field staff, etc., and troubleshooting if problems arise (for instance, if villages end up being larger than expected).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates active, ongoing monitoring during the intervention’s implementation. By engaging in follow-up work and troubleshooting unexpected issues (such as larger-than-anticipated villages), GiveDirectly improves its operational processes, which can help avoid cost overruns and inefficiencies, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has done some non-experimental operational research in remote parts of Uganda to examine the feasibility of implementing its program in places where, e.g., there is no cell coverage, there are no local mobile money agents, villages are several hours on foot from the nearest road, etc. GiveDirectly hopes to gather information about these recipients' experiences of receiving cash transfers, withdrawing transfers, and generally test the limits of who it can get transfers to effectively.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a form of monitoring where operational research is conducted in real-world challenging settings. By gathering detailed information on recipients’ experiences and logistical challenges, the organization is able to adjust its implementation strategy. These insights drive operational improvements that can reduce costs, thus enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For the UBI study, Dr. Cooke is working with IPA and the PIs on coordinating research operations with GiveDirectly field operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the integration of monitoring (through coordinated research operations) with field implementation. Such active coordination enables real-time adjustments and efficient resource management, which are key to optimizing operational processes and achieving higher cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** During the rollout, FDs and PAs have been running existing enrollment processes in parallel with the Segovia processes intended to replace them. This has allowed staff to note differences and unexpected outcomes. Testing and refining the Segovia system over the past couple weeks has taken approximately 15% of Carolina Toth's time as well as a few hours per week for field staff members. It is vital that this testing take place, though it has taken longer than was initially estimated. Predicted time savings are expected by early November 2014.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how active monitoring during implementation (running parallel processes to compare outcomes) enables GiveDirectly to identify inefficiencies and unexpected issues. The insights gained through this monitoring process drive refinements expected to save time and resources, thus contributing to increased cost effectiveness in operations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is refining its approach to adverse event management. These actions will make it easier for recipients to speak up and ensure that problems are dealt with effectively when brought to GiveDirectly's attention. GiveDirectly has spent time investigating rumors that turned out to be false. GiveDirectly is communicating to villages that participating communities need to help ensure that GiveDirectly's rules are followed. If evidence is found that the rules are being systematically abused, GiveDirectly will freeze work in that community as a whole. These pauses allow GiveDirectly to determine whether it is possible to continue and encourage community members to report problems so that they can be addressed. A new system of payday monitors and local informants was recently introduced in Uganda. Communities nominate and vote on candidates for the cash out day monitor positions. Monitors acquire prestige through their work with GiveDirectly and the public recognition from their peers.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly employs systematic monitoring in its adverse event management. By halting operations in communities where rules are breached and using local monitors to track issues, the organization can pause, assess, and adjust its intervention. This process helps prevent resource wastage and operational delays, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that GiveDirectly intensified monitoring during the intervention by increasing audits during paydays. The increased oversight helps detect and prevent fraudulent disbursements, which in turn supports operational processes that can enhance cost effectiveness by minimizing losses.

- **Quote:** Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
- **Reasoning:** This statement provides evidence of proactive, on-the-spot monitoring during the implementation phase. Such real-time checks ensure that any issues are immediately identified and rectified, thereby maintaining efficient operations and contributing to the cost effectiveness of the charity's processes.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO's and OM's dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that thorough follow-up and in-person monitoring were integral to the intervention's implementation. By ensuring high coverage in recipient follow-ups, GiveDirectly could quickly detect and correct issues, reinforcing operational efficiency and indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** Page 9 of GiveDirectly's written update describes operational improvements that GiveDirectly has implemented. GiveDirectly shared an example of the standardized operational reporting, available here: http://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/201406%20Monthly%200s%20reporting.xls3. Page 10 of GiveDirectly's written update gives information about the scorecards that GiveDirectly developed for staff performance evaluation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly monitors its operational processes during intervention through standardized reporting and performance scorecards. Such systematic monitoring enables the charity to track and evaluate field operations in real-time, facilitating adjustments that can enhance the cost effectiveness of its interventions.

- **Quote:** In response to this case, and as a part of its ongoing process improvement and growth, GiveDirectly has:
1. Sent an experienced staff member who is a trained counselor to conduct qualitative deep dives with seven other households GiveDirectly had identified as having experienced domestic conflict to understand their cases deeply and gain insight to inform policy changes.
2. Increased its detection mechanisms for adverse events in follow up surveys administered after each transfer. GiveDirectly has added a question to ask explicitly about "domestic violence," rather than "violence" in general, because people may not consider the former to qualify as part of the latter.
3. Created a specialized role for the above-mentioned experienced staff member with a counseling background, in which she personally manages complex cases. This consumes a substantial amount of her time. She is assisted by one other staff member in this.
4. Increased automation of adverse event information to improve detection, escalation, and tracking.
5. Developed and is currently in the process of rolling out an additional detection mechanism in which GiveDirectly calls village elders at key points in the process to ask about adverse events, because they are likely to hear about issues and may feel more of an obligation to report them, relative to an average village member.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed passage demonstrates active monitoring during implementation by outlining multiple mechanisms for detecting and tracking adverse events. By closely monitoring potential issues such as domestic conflict, GiveDirectly can promptly adjust operational protocols, which is a critical component in refining processes and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** We've observed meaningful improvements to the review process and would describe it today as very effective and efficient. A big strength of the process is how we're able to cover a lot of complex ground by email. Email dialogue is structured, specific, and convenient (esp. for field team), and phone time is used well for clean-up and digging in. We also appreciate your deferring to individuals' communication preferences for email vs. phone. We're getting into a good cadence where once you have all the info/data on an issue, we close it off and don't revisit in next cycle unless needed. This is exactly as we'd hope - as you build your institutional knowledge about us, the process gets streamlined significantly on our end.
- **Reasoning:** This quote, although not using the term 'monitoring' explicitly, outlines an ongoing review process during implementation. It demonstrates how structured communications and systematic closure of issues contribute to operational streamlining—a process that can enhance cost effectiveness by reducing redundancy and ensuring timely decisions.

- **Quote:** You may want to consider pushing harder on analyzing costs as much as you do on benefits. Evaluating cost data from the field can be tough since it requires a lot of on-the-ground context. Yet this could be an important value-add you provide the sector in terms of transparency and could factor into comparative assessments of interventions and orgs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the challenge and importance of monitoring cost data during field implementation. It suggests that rigorous analysis of on-the-ground cost data is a critical operational process, enabling transparency and informed comparative assessments that contribute to the intervention's overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly recently looked noticed some field officers straying outside their territory. It would like to build a tool to view enrollments on a map to better monitor where its field teams are operating.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes a monitoring initiative during the intervention – developing a tool to track field team locations – which is intended to improve operational oversight and thereby enhance cost effectiveness by ensuring field officers operate within their designated zones.

- **Quote:** Version 2.0 of Segovia, which has fewer bugs, saves an estimated 30 minutes of Field Directors' work on each update in Uganda, for a weekly time savings of about one hour. In Kenya, where GiveDirectly is still operating on the original version but will be switching to 2.0 soon, the weekly time savings will be greater because the database is updated daily.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how automated monitoring and regular updates of the enrollment database (a key operational process during implementation) reduce manual labor, thereby streamlining operations and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is tracking costs related to the study and trying to determine whether the effort to change its transfer schedule based on recipient preferences would be worth the benefit to recipients. This change would entail calling recipients to elicit their timing preferences, which would be a new step in GiveDirectly's process, so the cost of the calls would need to be compared to recipients' outcomes.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt shows active monitoring of the intervention’s operational changes—in this case, the cost implications of restructuring the transfer schedule. Tracking such costs during implementation allows the charity to evaluate process changes and adjust operations to optimize cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Learning objectives are internal tests conducted by GiveDirectly in which the standard campaign model is slightly varies. GiveDirectly uses results from learning objective campaigns to gather information about how it might adjust its operating procedures (e.g., experimentation with proxy means tests).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly actively monitors its intervention during implementation through internal learning objective campaigns. The insights gained are then used to adjust operating procedures, a process that contributes to enhanced efficiency and, by extension, cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** As part of its follow-up procedure, GiveDirectly asks recipients security-related questions, such as whether anyone knows that they are recipients and knew when they went to cash out, to monitor security risk.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly incorporates monitoring during implementation by routinely checking for security risks. By identifying and addressing potential security issues, the charity is better able to manage risks and avoid cost overruns, indirectly supporting its overall cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Carolina Toth, GiveDirectly, October 1, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** The data on the cost of iron roofs collected in the survey is reliable because the survey was conducted shortly after respondents had purchased roofing materials.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that timely monitoring (i.e., collecting data soon after the intervention occurs) ensures reliable cost data, which can inform operational decisions aimed at enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It would be easy to conduct a follow up survey with a much larger sample size. Such a survey may be worthwhile because questions about smearing and other costs were not included in the original survey. If GiveWell is interested in conducting a follow up survey, GiveDirectly has an independent translator it could recommend.
- **Reasoning:** This quote suggests that additional monitoring through follow-up surveys can uncover previously unmeasured cost factors. This additional data collection can refine operational processes, ultimately supporting more cost-effective interventions.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a key change in operational processes where monitoring is intensified by centralizing oversight with the Field Director. This closer monitoring during the intervention helps prevent issues such as fraud, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
- **Reasoning:** This evidence shows that GiveDirectly introduced on-the-ground monitoring mechanisms by involving community members. By observing transactions and reporting issues in real-time, these monitors contribute to maintaining the integrity of the intervention and minimizing financial losses, which supports operational cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights another proactive monitoring strategy during the intervention. The systematic follow-up by the call center ensures that any issues arising during cash out days are quickly detected, which is critical for streamlining operations and ensuring cost-effective service delivery.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process adjustment during the intervention—by potentially eliminating a step (the backcheck) based on monitoring and evaluation, GiveDirectly seeks to simplify procedures and reduce costs, directly tying operational changes to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that monitoring during implementation (tracking refusal rates and community response) leads to operational responses such as accelerated scheduling. Such adjustments, even if not completely resolving the issue, represent an attempt to modify processes in real time in order to maintain or improve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** 2014 performance on operational KPIs

Cumulatively, we have enrolled 15,254 households (~76,000 individuals) and sent / committed $15.5M
- **Reasoning:** This section provides a clear, quantitative record of the charity’s operational performance metrics during the implementation phase. By monitoring key indicators such as speed, throughput, productivity, and follow-up, the organization is able to assess the efficiency of its intervention, which in turn informs adjustments that enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored

\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
**Modification** & **Potential benefit** & **Potential cost** & **Sizing implications** \\ Eliminate "paydays" & 1.0% efficiency gain & Higher travel costs & Minimum scale of one village (200 recipients) \\  & & & \\ Use bank (vs telco) as payments vendor & 1.3% efficiency gain & FD time required to build/manage & Likely need 1K+ recipients to make partnership \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\ Use biometric authentication & & Lower risks of certain frauds & 1.1% efficiency loss for 1.5M campaign 1 & Need 0.5K recipients for 99% chance of \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\  & & & \\ \end{tabular}
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt outlines proposed modifications to the Uganda payments protocol along with estimated efficiency gains and costs. It demonstrates how ongoing monitoring of intervention performance informs decisions to adjust operational processes (such as eliminating paydays or shifting to bank vendors) in order to improve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly carries out its own surveys of the recipients of cash transfers via phone calls. It successfully reached 95% of the people in its first round of enrollment and has so far reached 67% of people in its second round of enrollment. Some of the topics in the survey which recipients are asked about are:
1. Whether the cash transfers have led to conflict between recipients and non-recipients.
2. How they are using the money and how they plan to use the money.
3. Their suggestions for GiveDirectly.
4. How long it takes them to get a national identification (if necessary) and register to receive cash transfers.
5. How long it takes them to travel to collect the cash transfer and how much it costs them to do so.
6. Whether their lives have improved as a result of the cash transfers
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly actively monitors its intervention during implementation by conducting detailed surveys. The monitoring collects operational data—such as registration times and travel costs—that provides essential feedback for improving operational processes, which can contribute to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** On the fourth point, it took recipients in its first round of enrollment an average of 1.3 months to register in GiveDirectly's first round of transfers. GiveDirectly cut this amount of time to 0.1 months for recipients in its second round of enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates how monitoring through data collection can lead to operational improvements. By identifying a long registration period and then reducing it drastically, GiveDirectly likely improved efficiency and reduced associated costs, thereby enhancing the cost effectiveness of its intervention.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly developed a system to evaluate field staff performance, using data on productivity and quality of work combined with subjective measures of teamwork and cooperation, as assessed by field staff supervisors. The system will generate monthly "scores" for each field staff member. GiveDirectly is not going to reduce the baseline salaries that it offers to staff, but it will offer bonuses to those with the highest performance scores.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly monitors its intervention through a systematic evaluation of field staff performance. By using data-driven scores and aligning incentives, the organization is able to refine its operational processes, potentially reducing errors and expediting effective service delivery, which enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Joe Huston, the incoming Kenya Field Director, is working to automate much of the data processing that happens during enrollment, such as integrating data collected at different times, generating lists of households and assignments for staff. GiveDirectly hopes that automation will reduce the time spent and errors made in these processes.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the monitoring of operational data through the automation of enrollment processes. By integrating and systematically processing data, GiveDirectly aims to minimize time wastage and errors, leading to more streamlined operations and improved cost effectiveness during the intervention's implementation.

- **Quote:** During the back check, which is GiveDirectly's last in-person step before transfers are sent, field staff nominate people who they consider to be vulnerable cases. After the initial token transfers are sent, GiveDirectly follows up in person with all of the people identified as potentially vulnerable. If their cases continue to seem worrisome, GiveDirectly field staff will follow up in person again after the first lump sum is sent. The first round of follow up has been completed for the Kenya $1.2M campaign, primarily by one field staff who is a former counselor and one who formerly worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of ongoing monitoring during the intervention. By conducting back checks and multiple follow-ups, GiveDirectly is able to preempt adverse events and mitigate risks. Such vigilant monitoring ensures problems are addressed promptly, thereby safeguarding the program’s efficiency and contributing to operational cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Currently, GiveDirectly is "knee deep" in testing the Segovia product. This software testing has been a major priority in recent months. Segovia technology will aggregate data on adverse events from follow up surveys, hotline calls, and in-field reports; it will also enable tracking of each adverse event.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the implementation of Segovia technology—a monitoring tool used during the intervention—to aggregate and track adverse events. Monitoring in this context is crucial as it collects real-time data that can be used to adjust operational processes, and thereby potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** The backcheck team visits households that have been registered to re-collect information collected at registration such as names and ID numbers. When visiting households, backcheck field officers do not reveal information previously documented about the households (e.g., would not call someone by the name that is written), because they want to see if the new information they are given matches up.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a monitoring activity during the intervention where backchecks are used to verify the accuracy of collected data. By ensuring that the information matches the original records, the process helps reduce errors and potential fraud, contributing to improved operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly collects information about recipients during the first three stages of a campaign: census, registration, and backcheck. Some information, such as recipient name, GPS location, housing materials, and identifying photograph, is collected at more than one stage and then checked for mismatches. (These checks are currently conducted using Excel but will eventually be automated through Segovia technology. One exception is comparing identifying photographs of recipients, which is done using Mechanical Turk.)
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a structured, multi-stage monitoring system that cross-verifies key recipient information throughout the implementation. Such systematic checks are designed to identify mismatches indicative of fraud or error, thereby streamlining operational processes and indirectly enhancing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached. Once GiveDirectly is confident that its field staff are delivering a consistent message, it may be interested in varying that message to emphasize different elements, such as encouraging long-term investments versus not giving any advice on how funds should be spent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an active monitoring process during the intervention—evaluating field staff communication through follow-up phone calls. This monitoring informs adjustments in operational procedures (like performance-based compensation) that are intended to improve efficiency, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation.
- **Reasoning:** This statement reinforces the idea that monitoring and experimenting with operational processes (e.g., staff compensation systems) form a key part of the charity’s intervention implementation. By affecting operational efficiency and integrity, these experiments are expected to enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Staff incentives: Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * Census: Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * Enrollment: Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * Back check: Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a real-time monitoring mechanism applied during the intervention's implementation. The charity is tracking key performance indicators related to census accuracy, recipient comprehension, and follow-up registration, and linking them to staff incentives. Such monitoring of operational performance can drive behavioral changes and accountability, thereby contributing to optimized operational processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-24-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly told us that it is not aware of any such issues so far, and it feels confident in its field staff managers, who have shown a high degree of commitment and have been working with GiveDirectly for a long time, and in its methods of process and data control. GiveDirectly plans to continue to monitor field staff activity.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly connects to the research question by demonstrating that during the implementation phase, GiveDirectly actively monitors its field staff. This monitoring ensures robust process and data control, which can prevent issues like falsification and inefficiencies, thereby contributing to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Currently, Field Directors spend much of their time downloading tables and manipulating them in Excel as well as producing rosters of work to email to Field Officers. The process of producing rosters of work is one example of a step that can be fully automated. The time savings achieved will allow Field Directors to spend more time on designing and piloting process innovations and other structural improvements.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how monitoring the operational workflows has identified inefficiencies—specifically in data management—which are being addressed through automation. The resulting time savings and process innovations enhance operational efficiency, directly linking monitoring during implementation to improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-18-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly now estimates that each Field Director will be able to manage about $7 million/year in transfer costs, while its previous estimate was $5 million/year. GiveDirectly explains that this estimate has risen partly due to improved digital data collection enabling an increase in the pace at which transfer campaigns progress, and partly because it has expanded its senior local staff, which gives the Field Director greater leverage to oversee a larger amount of money.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links improved digital data collection—a form of monitoring during the implementation of transfers—to enhanced operational processes. The increased pace of transfer campaigns and the ability of Field Directors to manage more funds suggest that ongoing monitoring contributes to operational efficiency and cost effectiveness, addressing the research question.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Segovia, the product GiveDirectly uses for end-to-end data management, enables GiveDirectly to track recipients' progress through each step of its enrollment, payment, and follow-up processes and manage other tasks such as data merging, matching checks between different steps, audit flags, and roster generation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly employs a comprehensive monitoring system during the implementation of its intervention. By tracking recipients at every stage, the charity is able to streamline operational processes, reduce errors, and thereby enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Segovia's monitoring and reporting tools, including its dashboards, provide significant value to GiveDirectly, particularly as its campaign numbers increase.
- **Reasoning:** This statement emphasizes the role of systematic monitoring in managing operational processes, especially as the scale of operations grows. The use of dashboards allows for real-time oversight, which is critical for making adjustments that can lead to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For its standard Kenya and Uganda programs, GiveDirectly has implemented a rule in Segovia to block payments until the previous one has been confirmed: for example, first and second lump sum payments are blocked until token and first lump sum payments, respectively, have been confirmed via a follow-up call or visit. In an effort to ensure implementation quality, GiveDirectly seeks to keep the percentage of households with blocked payments under 5%.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a specific monitoring mechanism used during the intervention, where payment processes are contingent on confirmation steps. This practice helps mitigate errors and potential misallocations, thereby indirectly contributing to more cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** Deployment of the Segovia system in Kenya is ongoing in parallel with development; new features are incorporated and bugs are worked out in the field, in real time.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly actively monitors its intervention as it is being implemented, making immediate adjustments in the operational process. Such real-time oversight is crucial for identifying and resolving issues, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Several metrics are being tracked to determine what difference Segovia has made to GiveDirectly's operations. One important metric is the time saved by FDs; FDs are informally keeping track of these timesavings and how they are using their increased capacity. Given that FD time is a significant cost for GiveDirectly, being able to put a dollar value onto the time saved by Segovia will give a strong indication of whether or not the system is useful. Another metric GD plans to track is the turnaround time on adverse events when that feature becomes available.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides concrete evidence of monitoring processes that measure operational savings, such as tracking time saved by Field Directors. The quantification of these metrics directly links monitoring activities to improvements in cost effectiveness, as efficiencies are translated into value savings.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is working on creating mobile and web apps to enable donors to track their donations, when GiveDirectly enrolls recipients, and how those recipients fare after receiving transfers. There are internal versions of a mobile app that include many of the desired elements but are not polished enough to release yet. The next version, which is currently in development and which GiveDirectly hopes to launch by the end of the year, will be a web interface. This would have several advantages over mobile apps:
* They are easier and cheaper to change and experiment with. This will allow GiveDirectly to create and test many versions before releasing it.
* There seems to be a significant barrier to downloading a mobile app. For example, Humans of New York has millions of followers online but only about 5,000 downloads of its mobile app.
* A web interface can more easily integrate with GiveDirectly's existing online presence.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly is developing digital tools to monitor key components of its intervention—such as tracking donor contributions, recipient enrollment, and post-transfer outcomes—during implementation. The emphasis on creating an easily modifiable and cost-effective web interface underscores how monitoring is integrated into operational processes that are intended to enhance the charity’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Provide services for ongoing operation of each water point: chlorine supply, fixing malfunctioning dispensers, marketing to increase uptake, monitoring and evaluation (DSW conducts 2-month, 4-month and 12-month evaluations for the 2100 dispensers it has installed)
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that monitoring and evaluation are explicitly integrated into the operational process during implementation, allowing DSW to track performance, identify issues, and make timely adjustments. Such ongoing monitoring is essential for ensuring that the intervention remains effective and cost-efficient over time.

- **Quote:** The field associates visit a sample of households using the chlorine dispenser, and test for levels of chlorine present in stored household drinking water. DSW also collects survey data in addition to monitoring chlorine levels.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that systematic data collection and monitoring at the household level are used to gauge intervention uptake and performance. The feedback gathered through these monitoring activities is crucial for refining operational processes, optimizing resource use, and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Site visit_2014.md
- **Quote:** After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how real-time monitoring during the cash out event allowed field staff to identify operational issues and adjust their approach by grouping beneficiaries with similar problems. Such adaptive monitoring can streamline the resolution process, thereby contributing to enhanced cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Mr. Skeates noted that far fewer people were withdrawing cash at this cash out day than he had expected.
- **Reasoning:** This observation, gathered through monitoring, highlights how tracking actual event turnout versus expectations can inform operational adjustments. Recognizing such discrepancies enables the charity to reallocate resources or modify procedures, which can lead to improved cost effectiveness.

## Code: Imposing standards on local stakeholders: Imposing requirements on the stakeholders involved in the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.md
- **Quote:** Eligibility was determined by living in a house with a thatched (rather than metal) roof. Such households were identified through a census conducted with the help of the village elder.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages local stakeholders—village elders—to identify eligible households based on a simple, observable criterion. By using local knowledge for targeting, the intervention minimizes administrative and search costs, contributing to its overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Recipients were provided with a Safaricom SIM card and asked to register for the mobile money service M-Pesa. Registration had to occur in the name of the designated transfer recipient.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational requirement imposed on local beneficiaries, ensuring that recipients engage with the digital payment system. The mandated M-Pesa registration streamlines cash distribution, reducing transaction and administrative costs and thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the charity intervention.

- **Quote:** The costs of the GD program at the time of the study amounted to $81 (nominal) per household.
- **Reasoning:** This detail provides a concrete measure of the program's low per-household operational cost. It implies that the simplified procedures and requirements—which involve local stakeholders in both targeting and delivery—helped achieve a high level of cost-effectiveness in the charity intervention.

### Doc Name: FAQ _ GiveDirectly.md
- **Quote:** Why not put conditions on what people have to do to get transfers?
We choose to provide unconditional, rather than conditional, cash transfers for two reasons. First, empowering the poor to make their own decisions advances our core value of respect. Second, imposing conditions requires costly monitoring and enforcement structures be put in place. One detailed estimate put the administrative costs of a conditional cash transfer scheme as high as 63% of the transfers made over the first three years of the program (Caldes, Natalia, and John Maluccio. "The Costs of Conditional Cash Transfers." Journal of International Development 17 pp. 151-168, 2005). Our read of the existing experimental evidence comparing the impact of conditional to unconditional transfers is that there is little evidence to suggest these added costs produce commensurate benefits.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by highlighting that operational processes imposing conditions on local stakeholders significantly increase administrative costs, which can undermine cost-effectiveness. It implies that by avoiding such imposed requirements, the intervention maintains lower overhead costs, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** * Using biometrics to authenticate recipients at the cash-out point
- **Reasoning:** This operational detail imposes a technical requirement on local beneficiaries to verify their identity before cash-out. Such a process can reduce fraud and ensure that aid reaches the correct individuals, mechanisms that contribute indirectly to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * County-level government approval equivalent to ~70 K additional eligible households in Siaya and Homa Bay counties
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the intervention requires local government involvement for approval, thereby imposing a requirement on local stakeholders. This process may foster accountability and proper scaling—which can be essential to achieving cost-effectiveness in program delivery.

- **Quote:** * Bukedia district still has 27,000 un-visited, eligible households, and country-wide registration is in process that will provide approval for all 7.3m households in Uganda.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes a large-scale registration process imposing a requirement on local households to be approved before receiving aid. Such a systematic approach can enhance targeting efficiency and resource allocation, both of which are important aspects of cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Niehaus 12-7-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Before launching a campaign, GiveDirectly secures the buy-in of Chiefs, who are elected to work at the regional level, presiding over Sub-Chiefs and Village Elders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders by engaging Chiefs. Such engagement is intended to establish community oversight and accountability, thereby potentially reducing inefficiencies and corruption which can contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly aims to not rely on Village Elders for any part of the cash transfer process, because they may be biased by personal relationships and therefore unreliable.
- **Reasoning:** By avoiding reliance on potentially biased local stakeholders, this operational decision helps to ensure a more objective and efficient cash transfer process, indirectly fostering cost-effectiveness by reducing risks of misallocation and inefficiency.

- **Quote:** When GiveDirectly staff discover that a Village Elder has attempted to solicit bribes from recipients, the Field Director in that country reports the issue to the presiding Chief.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a specific accountability measure where local stakeholders are monitored and held responsible for their actions. Reporting misconduct helps mitigate corruption, which is crucial for ensuring that resources are used effectively and cost-effectively.

- **Quote:** There have been four cases in which Chiefs have removed Village Elders from their positions because of issues that GiveDirectly reported.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an enforcement mechanism in place using local stakeholder structures. The removal of non-performing Village Elders by Chiefs supports operational integrity, reducing waste and enhancing the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 7-7-14 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Identify needs households that do not meet current selection criteria. Designed to supplement (not replace) existing proxy means tests. Individual secret ballot voting (2 villages, occurred after a group discussion)

Community rankings : (2 villages); during a group discussion, groups agreed on a ranked list

Process  
Process is staff intensive due to small group discussions, necessary for clear instruction

All villages ultimately gave the process positive reviews, but in some villages a substantial share of participants had strong adverse reactions

In 4 of 4 villages, participants urged GiveDirectly to go door to door to identify needy households rather than relying on community nominations
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that involves local stakeholders through secret ballot voting and community rankings. It highlights how the intervention imposes requirements on local communities to participate in beneficiary selection, which can influence cost-effectiveness by affecting both the accuracy of targeting and the associated operational costs.

- **Quote:** Occasional cases of favoritism (e.g. a nomination of a village elders based on obligations). May add additional question to the census (e.g. quality of housing materials, number of dependents); this would add ~$1.5-$2 per household given verification costs. Also considering supplemental community targeting. This would add ~$2-$3 per household to existing processes, and has greater potential for conflict. Final decision requires weighing cost tradeoffs, and would also require additional pilots to refine operations, test costs, and assess how accurately these methods reach the poor.
- **Reasoning:** This quote connects the involvement of local stakeholders to cost implications by indicating that additional requirements, such as extra verification steps, could increase per household costs. It directly engages with the research question by illustrating the trade-offs that must be weighed to achieve cost-effectiveness when imposing operational requirements on local communities.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, October 6, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At the meeting, staff told recipients that GiveDirectly would not work in areas where people are dishonest, and that it was pausing transfers until the issues were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked recipients to report any information they had about the gaming.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process in which local stakeholders are held accountable by mandating honesty in eligibility reporting. By pausing transfers in areas exhibiting dishonest behavior, the intervention aims to prevent misallocation of resources. This process indirectly contributes to cost-effectiveness by ensuring that funds are allocated only in communities that adhere to required standards.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is communicating to villages that participating communities need to help ensure that GiveDirectly's rules are followed. If evidence is found that the rules are being systematically abused, GiveDirectly will freeze work in that community as a whole. These pauses allow GiveDirectly to determine whether it is possible to continue and encourage community members to report problems so that they can be addressed.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a clear operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders to enforce adherence to the charity’s rules. By instituting consequences such as freezing operations when rules are breached, the organization is likely aiming to maintain efficient and proper use of resources, thus contributing to cost-effectiveness in its intervention.

### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process change that enforces role separation among local staff. By imposing clear divisions of responsibility, the organization reduces the risk of collusion and fraud, which in turn helps ensure that funds are used efficiently and contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
- **Reasoning:** This quote is evidence of an operational requirement imposed on local processes—specifically, the complete auditing of payday events. By expanding audits from a quarter of the events to all events, GiveDirectly enhances oversight and accountability during disbursements, which is a key mechanism for maintaining cost-effectiveness through the prevention of financial leakage.

- **Quote:** Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process imposes a requirement for real-time monitoring of the fund distribution event. By verifying that recipients receive the correct amounts as transfers occur, the process mitigates errors and potential fraud, thereby promoting transparency and efficiency that are essential for achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Conducted village meetings to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria - housing materials were preferred
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates an operational process that requires local stakeholder participation in defining eligibility criteria, which may contribute to cost-effectiveness by aligning intervention strategies with community preferences and potentially reducing misallocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Breaking community into groups to cross-check one another is a good way to mitigate elite capture
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders through group verification. By mitigating elite capture, the process aims to ensure resources reach the intended beneficiaries, which can indirectly improve cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Visited, verified, and registered all households categorized as eligible by saturation criteria from the groups
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational step involving local stakeholders in verifying and registering households. Such meticulous verification enhances targeting accuracy and operational efficiency, factors that contribute to achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_05-28-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** Under GiveDirectly's rolling model (as in Kenya), a field director may update the database daily, as each team needs data from it and may be carrying out activities in quick succession. Version 2.0 of Segovia, which has fewer bugs, saves an estimated 30 minutes of Field Directors' work on each update in Uganda, for a weekly time savings of about one hour.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that requires local field directors to perform frequent database updates. The move to an automated, more efficient system (Segovia 2.0) reduces time spent on these required tasks, which contributes to cost-effectiveness by lowering labor costs and streamlining operations.

- **Quote:** This change would entail calling recipients to elicit their timing preferences, which would be a new step in GiveDirectly's process, so the cost of the calls would need to be compared to recipients' outcomes.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an operational adjustment that imposes a new requirement on local stakeholders (the recipients) by having them provide timing preferences. The evaluation of call costs against the benefits indicates that such operational demands are being scrutinized for their cost-effectiveness, directly addressing the research question.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** To help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipient whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders—by mandating community involvement in selecting and validating trustees—to safeguard the transfer process. This community-based requirement helps mitigate fraud and misappropriation, thereby indirectly contributing to cost-effectiveness by ensuring that a high proportion of donated funds directly reach recipients.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt highlights an operational process involving local government stakeholders who must grant approvals for program enrollment. The ability to secure rapid approval reduces potential delays and administrative costs, which supports maintaining cost-effectiveness in the intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs. However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another instance where obtaining approval from local government bodies is an operational requirement. Efficient handling of these local stakeholder approvals is critical to ensuring smooth implementation and minimizing overheads, thereby indirectly supporting cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that imposes a requirement on local stakeholders—in this case, community members acting as monitors. By requiring these local stakeholders to oversee transactions and report issues, the process is designed to reduce fraud and errors, thereby indirectly supporting cost-effectiveness in the charity intervention.

- **Quote:** Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates another operational process that imposes accountability requirements on local stakeholders (mobile money agents). By integrating an indemnity clause, the process aims to prevent financial losses due to fraud, which contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:
  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.
  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process where local stakeholders (community members and mobile-money agents) are required to take on specific roles for cash-out, which reduces the need for building proprietary payment infrastructure. By leveraging local resources, the process contributes to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the existing operational process imposes frequent interactions and multiple steps on recipients, which drives up costs. By potentially reducing these requirements—such as removing the backcheck step—the process could lower operational costs and thus improve cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Carolina_Toth_02-20-2015_(public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** 2015 operational priorities (see appendix for deprioritized)
Move $15.1M in Kenya at 91% efficiency, with focus on testing maximum throughput
Move $2.3M in Uganda at 86% efficiency, with focus on more secure and efficient payments process
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly ties operational modifications to efficiency targets, implying that processes (which likely impose requirements on local stakeholders) are designed to improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modifications to Uganda payments protocol to be explored

\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
**Modification** & **Potential benefit** & **Potential cost** & **Sizing implications** \\ Eliminate "paydays" & 1.0% efficiency gain & Higher travel costs & Minimum scale of one village (200 recipients) \\  & & & \\ Use bank (vs telco) as payments vendor & 1.3% efficiency gain & FD time required to build/manage & Likely need 1K+ recipients to make partnership \\  & & & \\ \end{tabular}
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt provides detailed potential modifications to the Uganda payments protocol, including efficiency gains tied to specific process changes. It demonstrates how adjusting operational processes—imposing new requirements on local execution—directly factors into enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly Notes October 6, 2012 - public.md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also employs project-based staff: accountants, field workers who do surveys, and field workers who check that recipient households meet GiveDirectly's criteria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that imposes eligibility requirements on local stakeholders (through the screening of recipient households), which can be instrumental in ensuring that funds are directed appropriately and thereby contributes to cost-effectiveness by reducing misallocation and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** On the fourth point, it took recipients in its first round of enrollment an average of 1.3 months to register in GiveDirectly's first round of transfers. GiveDirectly cut this amount of time to 0.1 months for recipients in its second round of enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process imposed on local stakeholders—the registration process—and shows how streamlining these requirements significantly reduced processing time. Such efficiency improvements suggest that refining operational requirements can lower administrative delays and costs, contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly, April 8, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly conducted village meetings in two villages before recipients were enrolled, to determine community preferences on eligibility criteria. In both of these pilots, village members chose housing materials as the best indicator of poverty.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where the organization requires local stakeholders to participate in setting eligibility criteria. By involving village members in determining poverty indicators, GiveDirectly leverages local knowledge, potentially reducing reliance on more expensive data collection methods and thus contributing to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Another benefit is that it could be less expensive than a census for GiveDirectly to administer the household classification at a village meeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly connects a local stakeholder–driven operational process (conducting household classification during village meetings) to cost-effectiveness by explicitly stating that this approach is cheaper than performing a full census. It demonstrates how imposing participation requirements on local stakeholders can yield financial efficiencies.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md
- **Quote:** Forming partnerships with government officials has the benefit of expediting the government approvals process and possibly leveraging public funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote is relevant because it highlights an operational process involving local stakeholders—government officials—where partnering can expedite approvals and leverage public funds, thus reducing costs.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that in Kenya it is important to maintain relationships with government officials at the county and district levels; district commissioners introduce GiveDirectly to chiefs, and chiefs introduce GiveDirectly to village elders.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details a structured engagement with a hierarchy of local stakeholders, illustrating an operational process that, by streamlining local coordination and approvals, may indirectly enhance cost-effectiveness through improved efficiency.

- **Quote:** The whole approvals process took 2 weeks from the time that Joe Huston (Kenya Field Director) met with the district commissioner to the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides concrete evidence of operational efficiency in the approval process involving local stakeholders; a rapid approval timeline can reduce administrative overhead and delays, thus supporting cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with GiveDirectly field staff, October 20-21, 2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** For example, when GiveDirectly enters a new village in Uganda, over 90% of recipients need SIM cards because they did not previously have cell phones, and about 70-80% of recipients need national IDs. GiveDirectly coordinates registration drives for people to get national IDs - they buy national ID booklets, print a photo of each recipient to put in the booklets, and have the Local Councilperson stamp the booklets to approve them.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that imposes a requirement on local stakeholders (i.e., the Local Councilperson stamping the ID booklets) and participants (requiring national IDs). Although it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, the requirement helps ensure timely and accurate enrollment, which can reduce fraud and streamline transfers—a process that likely contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the Uganda 2M campaign, there are 9 villages, and GiveDirectly was able to put them all through the national ID registration process within 1 month, so that 90% of eligible households were ready to receive transfers when payments started.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how the operational process, facilitated by local stakeholder involvement, ensures rapid completion of a critical registration requirement. By getting 90% of households ready within a short timeframe, the process minimizes delays and administrative costs, indirectly supporting cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** Within the last few weeks, GiveDirectly has decided to experiment with compensation for field staff based on how effectively they communicate information to recipients during enrollment. The effectiveness of field staff communications will be evaluated based on the fraction of recipients who can correctly explain information about the transfers on a follow-up phone call, including what the transfers can be used for and if there are conditions attached.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where field staff (local stakeholders) face specific performance requirements in communicating program details. By linking compensation to accurate message delivery, the program aims to enhance communication efficiency, which is a component that may improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Yes, but it is not only different structures that are valuable to study. It is also useful to experiment with different operational procedures for cash transfer programs that affect efficiency, integrity and recipient experience, like our new system for field staff compensation. GiveDirectly is pursuing both structural and operational questions for future research. While we want to maximize our experimentation and testing, any additional steps we add increase the complexity of the operations that our staff have to manage, so that is a consideration.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores that experimenting with operational procedures— which impose requirements on local stakeholders such as field staff— can impact key dimensions like efficiency and integrity. Although cost-effectiveness is not mentioned explicitly, improved operational efficiency is integral to achieving cost-effectiveness in charity interventions.

### Doc Name: GiveDirectly 8-27-13 (public) supplementary material.md
- **Quote:** Staff incentives: Randomly select 50% of field staff to participate in scheme that provides 10% bonus on total pay for the period based on following performance metrics: * Census: Percent of households in village missed in census (<5%) * Enrollment: Recipient scores on blind comprehension audit (>90%) and on-time registration rate (#1 and #2 highest rates are rewarded) * Back check: Scores on blind comprehension audit among recipients who still have not registered
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process that imposes explicit performance requirements on local field staff—a key group of local stakeholders. By linking bonus incentives to census accuracy, enrollment quality, and follow-up checks, the process implicitly targets improved operational efficiency, which may contribute to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Field staff now work continuously, year-round as long as funds are available to distribute, rather than in discreet campaigns as before.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a change in the operational process—a rolling model—that requires local field staff to work continuously. Such a systemic shift in the way local stakeholders engage with the intervention can enhance operational predictability and efficiency, which are key elements of achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly said that the Segovia product will fully automate the data management from enrollment to payment. GiveDirectly expects that this technology product will result in significant efficiency gains and quality improvement.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that by imposing the requirement for local staff to adopt a digital data management system, the intervention intends to streamline operations. The anticipated efficiency gains from automation indicate a move toward cost-effectiveness by reducing manual work, minimizing errors, and optimizing resource use.

- **Quote:** Currently, Field Directors spend much of their time downloading tables and manipulating them in Excel as well as producing rosters of work to email to Field Officers. The process of producing rosters of work is one example of a step that can be fully automated. The time savings achieved will allow Field Directors to spend more time on designing and piloting process innovations and other structural improvements.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores the current operational burden on local staff, particularly Field Directors, through manual data handling tasks. The planned automation of these processes reflects an operational requirement shift that, by saving time and reallocating staff efforts toward innovation, contributes to improved cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The governance structure of the second country is more decentralized than in Kenya, which required GiveDirectly to spend slightly more time working with local authorities before starting transfers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that, in a decentralized context, GiveDirectly must engage with local authorities as a required operational process. This imposition on local stakeholders—by necessitating additional coordination—suggests that such processes are integral to adapting interventions to local governance, potentially impacting cost-effectiveness by ensuring that transfers are coordinated efficiently.

- **Quote:** In response, GiveDirectly has been more proactive in coordinating with the mobile money service for the transfers that have begun, for example, by giving the mobile money service advanced notice before sending the funds so that agents could be prepared. In some cases, agents traveled to the villages in which recipients live to reduce recipient travel time.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational process that imposes requirements on local mobile money agents, such as advanced preparation and even traveling to villages. These requirements help streamline the transfer process by reducing recipient travel time and logistical delays, which can contribute to overall cost-effectiveness by ensuring funds are transferred more efficiently.

### Doc Name: Ian_Bassin_Piali_Mukhopadhyay_08-23-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** For its standard Kenya and Uganda programs, GiveDirectly has implemented a rule in Segovia to block payments until the previous one has been confirmed: for example, first and second lump sum payments are blocked until token and first lump sum payments, respectively, have been confirmed via a follow-up call or visit. In an effort to ensure implementation quality, GiveDirectly seeks to keep the percentage of households with blocked payments under 5%.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that imposes a confirmation requirement on recipients before releasing further payments. Although it does not explicitly connect this requirement to cost-effectiveness, ensuring implementation quality by verifying payment steps likely minimizes errors and fraud, which in turn can enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In early 2016, GiveDirectly allocated a fairly large sum of money to test a new implementation model in Kenya. A separate field director and team were hired approximately six months ago, and the experiment is taking place in an area close to GiveDirectly's other field operations. The primary aim is to double the program's size in 2017 without significantly increasing the management structure. The new model seeks to increase throughput per manager by eliminating the token payment and back check steps. GiveDirectly will assess gains in throughput as well as costs, which might occur in the areas of comprehension and fraud.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an experimental approach where existing operational requirements (such as the token payment and back check steps) are being reconsidered in order to boost efficiency and reduce costs. While the focus is on removing certain imposed steps rather than enforcing them, the discussion implies that current processes—which include strict requirements on local stakeholders—may have cost implications, prompting a test of alternative models aimed at enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process in which local stakeholders (in this case, the Rwandan government) impose requirements on NGOs. Although it does not explicitly link these requirements to cost-effectiveness, it provides context on how GiveDirectly must align its operations to meet local regulatory standards—a factor that can influence the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its interventions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments).
- **Reasoning:** This quote touches on the potential drawbacks of operational processes that impose control or requirements by local governments. It suggests that when local stakeholders impose certain requirements, there might be a compromise in the charity’s ability to maintain strong program implementation—a key factor for achieving cost-effectiveness. This indirectly informs the discussion on how such operational processes might affect cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md
- **Quote:** However, it also provides initial evidence that GiveDirectly recipients are unlikely to invest their transfers in business activities at high returns, as seen in RCTs of programs that provide business training in addition to cash transfers and/or require recipients to propose business plans. We believe that some combination of GiveDirectly's lack of a business plan requirement, lack of business skills training, and broader age-range of participants is the best explanation for the apparently lower returns earned by its participants.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly contrasts GiveDirectly’s model—which imposes minimal operational requirements—with other interventions that require additional processes such as business plan proposals and training. The implication is that fewer imposed requirements can result in lower administrative costs, thereby contributing to higher overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Group structure. The group structure of YOP may have acted as a commitment device, leading recipients to invest a greater portion of their grants than recipients of unconditional transfers directly to individuals, like GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote suggests that operational processes imposing collective requirements (such as group structures) can serve as commitment devices that drive disciplined investment behavior. Such disciplined investment can improve the long-term returns on transfers, which is a key component in achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Business plan requirement. We are unable to determine the extent to which the requirement to have a business plan approved encouraged participants to invest more money at higher returns than they would have in the absence of such a requirement.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights an operational process—imposing a business plan requirement—that is designed to guide recipients’ investment decisions. Although the evidence is inconclusive, it underscores the notion that such requirements may influence investment behavior, which in turn could affect the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Host community meetings in areas that DSW has selected. The meeting is advertised by calling village elders, posting notices, announcements by megaphone, and by meeting with a couple villagers initially and asking them to tell others about the meeting. Community meetings serve to sensitize the community members to the program and inform them of the benefits of chlorine, as well as to ask if they are ready to have the program (to formally secure their buy in). At community meetings, DSW staff explain how to use the chlorine dispensers to treat water, address any problems people raise, and collect phone numbers of community members for use when DSW sends text messages to promote the use of the dispensers. DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process that imposes direct requirements on local stakeholders by requiring community members to contribute materials and labor. Such cost-sharing measures may lower the program's direct expenses, thereby contributing to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational procedure that includes a requirement on local stakeholders (e.g., obtaining the land-owner's amenability) as a criterion for selecting water points. Enforcing such requirements helps ensure smooth implementation and may reduce unforeseen costs, thereby indirectly contributing to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Attendees of this meeting elect a person from the village to be the official chlorine dispenser promoter by show of hands or secret ballot. The promoters are charged with refilling dispensers with the chlorine supplies that DSW delivers, ensuring the dispenser is in working order, communicating any issues to DSW staff, and reaching out to people to encourage them to use the dispenser. Promoters are given chlorine dispenser promoter T-shirts, and are sometimes given a small gift such as $1 of phone credit per month, but in the past have otherwise been unpaid.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the delegation of operational responsibilities to local stakeholders via the election of a local promoter. By shifting routine tasks to a local individual, the intervention minimizes the need for expensive external staff support, enhancing its overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process—coordinating cash out days—that imposes specific requirements on local stakeholders (i.e., recipients must attend a designated cash out location) and links directly to cost-effectiveness by reducing transportation costs and streamlining fund access.
