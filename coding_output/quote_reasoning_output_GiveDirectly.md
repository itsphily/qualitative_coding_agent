## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adapted its operational structure in Uganda by splitting roles—mirroring its more effective system in Kenya—to reduce fraud risks. This adaptation reflects tailoring processes to local conditions, which can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a location-specific operational change where GiveDirectly switches from a less accessible payment system (EZEE Money) to one with a broader local presence (MTN). Such an adjustment adapts the intervention to local infrastructure constraints, likely contributing to improved efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly modifies its operational intervention by adjusting transfer amounts in Kenya in response to local economic conditions (i.e. inflation). By indexing transfer amounts to inflation, the organization adapts to the specific financial realities of the location, a change aimed at maintaining cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly tailors its eligibility criteria based on local conditions. In areas like Homa Bay County where thatched roofs are uncommon, the organization adapts its targeting process by developing alternative proxy tests, thereby modifying its operational approach to better fit local needs and ensure cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adapting its cash disbursement process in Uganda by testing a distributed cashout model. This modification is in response to local infrastructural challenges and aims to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness by leveraging the strongest local mobile money network.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is actively modifying its operational processes—specifically the methods of disbursement and eligibility criteria—potentially tailoring these approaches to local conditions. Such adaptive modifications can help streamline interventions and reduce inefficiencies, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** Here the operational process is altered by relocating the call center based on geographic distinctions between Kampala and Mbale. This location-specific change is designed to mitigate risks (such as fraud) and improve oversight, aligning the intervention more closely with local operational realities and enhancing cost-effective management.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly adapting its intervention by incorporating local community members to address language and oversight challenges. Tailoring the monitoring process to the local context helps ensure that operations run smoothly and efficiently, which is a key aspect of achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.
- **Reasoning:** In this instance, a location-specific issue (gaming in a Kenyan village) prompted GiveDirectly to modify its operational process by pausing transfers and engaging the local community. Such measures indicate an approach that adapts interventions to specific local challenges, potentially preventing resource wastage and supporting greater cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:

* Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
* A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly is modifying its operational processes by testing alternative models of cash transfer distribution that are tailored to local infrastructural conditions. The adaptation—using mobile-money agents in low-infrastructure areas and reducing the frequency of in-person interactions—is designed to lower operational costs, aligning closely with the research question on achieving cost effectiveness through location-specific interventions.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a clear example of adapting interventions to the specific needs of a location. By employing different targeting criteria in Homa Bay based on local feedback, GiveDirectly is tailoring its operational processes to address unique local conditions, which in turn supports cost-effective program implementation. This directly addresses the research question on location-specific operational modifications.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that GiveDirectly adapts its operational strategy by concentrating its interventions within countries where it already has a presence, choosing not to expand geographically in order to maintain cost efficiency. This reflects an adaptation based on the specific contextual advantages of each location.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that GiveDirectly modifies its operational processes to suit the local context in Rwanda by accelerating capacity-building efforts and adjusting to local regulatory requirements. Although cost effectiveness is not directly mentioned, such adaptations are likely intended to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs in line with local conditions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity is experimenting with different intervention models in a specific location (Rwanda), which suggests that it is adapting its interventions to identify the most effective and potentially cost-effective approach for that local context.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly deliberately prioritized pre-intervention data collection (i.e. baseline surveys) before fully rolling out its cash transfer program. Although it does not explicitly connect this practice to cost effectiveness, the intentional delay to gather critical information suggests that collecting contextual data can inform and potentially refine operational processes, which is central to the research question.

### Doc Name: Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md
- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly illustrates that pre-intervention information collection—in this case, a baseline survey—is a critical input that directly influences operational decisions. The necessity to complete the baseline survey before proceeding with token transfers forced GiveDirectly to adjust its timeline, preserving the study's randomization and overall integrity, which is integral to maintaining cost effectiveness.

The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention information (feedback from focus groups regarding the vulnerability of widows) to inform its operational process of designing new targeting criteria. By gathering such information before fully testing the criteria, GiveDirectly aims to ensure that its operational approach is better tailored to the needs of the charitable cause, which could in turn enhance cost-effectiveness.
