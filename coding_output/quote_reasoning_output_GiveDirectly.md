## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to the local context by selecting a mobile money provider that better suits the availability of agents in the area. This adjustment can reduce logistical constraints and fraud risks, indirectly contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational adaptation where roles are decoupled to minimize conflicts of interest and fraud. By structuring processes to fit local operational challenges, GiveDirectly aims to enhance accountability and efficiency, which are key components of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement directly compares the efficiency between programs in different locations, implying that location-specific operational processes—tailored to the local environment—can lead to variations in overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes—specifically budgeting and setting efficiency targets—based on the local cost structure and operational realities of each country. By customizing these targets, the organization can manage resources effectively, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows an operational adjustment to local economic conditions—in this case, adjusting transfer sizes for inflation in Kenya. By indexing transfers to inflation, GiveDirectly maintains the real value of aid and ensures its cost-effectiveness remains intact despite local economic fluctuations.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the adaptation of operational processes through the use of location-specific eligibility criteria. By tailoring the poverty proxy (e.g., switching from thatch to another criterion in Homa Bay County), GiveDirectly enhances targeting accuracy, which in turn contributes to improved cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are allocated to those most in need.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process adjustment—altering the way cash out days are managed and how recipients are targeted—which can be seen as adapting the intervention to specific local conditions. While it does not explicitly discuss cost effectiveness, such tailored protocol changes likely aim to streamline operations and reduce inefficiencies, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of leveraging local community resources to oversee operations—a localized adaptation meant to address on-the-ground challenges (eg, language or trust barriers). By ensuring transactions are properly supervised, the process helps mitigate risks of fraud and mismanagement, which can improve overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational change is location-specific, separating functions geographically to reduce potential conflicts or fraud. Such a measure adapts the intervention to regional realities and could lead to improved operational integrity and cost savings, thereby contributing to the charity's overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:
* Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
* A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly describes how GiveDirectly is exploring operational adaptations that tailor its cash transfer distribution process to differing local infrastructural conditions. The approach of employing mobile-money agents and informal local agents in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, along with streamlining processes by reducing interaction frequency, clearly illustrates an effort to reduce operational complexity and costs, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its targeting strategy based on local context by incorporating community feedback specific to Homa Bay County. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, tailoring the intervention to the specific characteristics of a location can improve the precision of resource allocation and reduce inefficiencies, thereby indirectly contributing to the intervention’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly’s adaptation to Rwanda’s specific operational environment. The tailored processes—such as coordinating with government regulations—illustrate how adapting interventions to local characteristics may streamline operations and potentially contribute to cost effectiveness, even though the direct impact on costs is not explicitly stated.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This passage connects location-specific operational decisions with cost efficiency. By choosing to focus on areas where they already operate—thereby adapting their interventions to familiar local contexts—GiveDirectly avoids the higher costs associated with setting up operations in new locations, which directly supports the research question’s focus on cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly made an operational decision—in this case, slowing enrollment—to ensure pre-intervention baseline data was collected. While it does not directly mention cost effectiveness, the adjustment indicates that collecting pre-intervention data can shape operational processes, potentially allowing the charity to evaluate and streamline interventions effectively.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how the need to collect pre-intervention (baseline) data—required to ensure valid randomization and research integrity—impacts the operational timeline. By delaying token transfers, GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes to accommodate the crucial baseline survey, thereby preserving the evaluation integrity that underpins cost-effective decision making.

- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data—feedback from focus groups—before fully implementing new targeting criteria. By using information gathered prior to the intervention, they refined their operational process (targeting), which could contribute to enhanced cost effectiveness by directing resources more efficiently.
