## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process adapted to local conditions—specifically, choosing a mobile money provider with a broader agent network to address local limitations. Such an adaptation can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing logistical constraints and providing greater flexibility for recipients.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote contrasts the efficiency of operations in different locations, implying that adaptations to local conditions (in this case, in Kenya versus Uganda) can result in differing levels of operational efficiency—a key component of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its targeting mechanism based on local conditions. By modifying eligibility criteria to reflect the local context (e.g., thatch is not common in Homa Bay County), the organization improves targeting efficiency which can contribute to maintaining or enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.

GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adapts its intervention by adjusting transfer sizes to account for local economic conditions, such as inflation in Kenya. By indexing transfer amounts to current inflation rates, the organization ensures that the real value of transfers is maintained relative to rising costs, thereby supporting overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reveals an adaptation in distribution methods in Uganda to better fit the local context. By testing a distributed cashout model that leverages the broad network of MTN, GiveDirectly is responding to logistical challenges unique to the location, which can reduce operational inefficiencies and thereby contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly's program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is evaluating its operational processes from a financial perspective, suggesting an interest in understanding how cost tradeoffs play out. Although it does not explicitly mention adapting interventions to local needs, the focus on cost tradeoffs is related to assessing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.
- **Reasoning:** This statement reflects an operational adjustment where the intervention is adapted—by broadening the targeting criteria—to better fit local demographic or contextual conditions. While it implies a tailored approach, it does not directly discuss the impact on cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This operational change demonstrates an adaptation based on geographic conditions (with staff in Kampala separated from those in Mbale) likely aimed at improving oversight and reducing risks such as fraud. Although the quote does not explicitly state its cost effectiveness, such measures can be interpreted as efforts to reduce inefficiencies and losses.

- **Quote:** Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reveals an adaptive operational process where contractual terms are modified to mitigate financial risks associated with fraud. The potential for reducing losses through such measures may contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness, though the document stops short of making that connection explicit.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly tailors its distribution process to address local infrastructural challenges. By adapting operations to areas with limited mobile-payment capabilities, the organization seeks to lower the costs of building new systems, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an operational adjustment aimed at streamlining procedures. By reducing the number of in-person interactions and administrative steps, GiveDirectly targets lower operational costs, illustrating how adapting intervention processes can drive cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adapts its operations to the specific regulatory and contextual conditions in Rwanda. The rapid capacity building, efficient registration, and tailored coordination suggest an operational process that aligns interventions with local conditions, which can contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly ties location-specific operational decisions to cost efficiency. By choosing to focus on areas where they already have adapted operations, GiveDirectly is able to avoid the higher costs of establishing new country setups, thereby contributing to cost effective interventions.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly deliberately collected pre-intervention data (baseline surveys) before proceeding with the intervention in Kenya. Although the text does not explicitly link these baseline surveys to the development of operational processes that make the charity cost effective, the decision to collect such information before implementation suggests a recognition of the importance of understanding the context and conditions prior to intervention—a practice that can indirectly contribute to more informed and potentially cost‐effective operational planning.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that collecting pre-intervention information—in this case, a baseline survey conducted before cash transfers—directly influences operational decisions such as delaying transfers to preserve study integrity. Maintaining valid pre-intervention data is critical for sound research design, which in turn informs and improves operational processes that underpin cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that pre-intervention baseline data (from the GE study) is used to evaluate and refine eligibility criteria. By leveraging this information to optimize targeting procedures, GiveDirectly is able to enhance its operational processes, ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated—a key component of maintaining cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention information—feedback from focus groups—prior to fully launching the new targeting criteria. By incorporating this pre-intervention data into the development of their operational processes, they are able to adjust and refine their approach to ensure that the intervention (cash transfer program) is more accurately targeted, which can help in achieving cost effectiveness.
