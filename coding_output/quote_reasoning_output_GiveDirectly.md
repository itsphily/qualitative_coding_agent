### Not Worth Reading

## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adjustment that leverages geographic separation to reduce conflicts of interest and fraud. By moving functions to a different location (Kampala), GiveDirectly adapts its processes based on location-specific factors, which can contribute indirectly to cost‐effectiveness by reducing losses and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an operational change made in response to local market conditions. Switching to MTN, which has a more extensive network of agents, shows that adapting interventions based on local factors can reduce bottlenecks and improve efficiency, which is an aspect contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another example of tailoring operational processes to local conditions. By recruiting local informants, GiveDirectly enhances fraud detection through a mechanism sensitive to local language and context. This adaptation, though indirectly, supports cost-effectiveness by safeguarding resources from fraud-related losses.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how maintaining a static transfer size despite location-specific economic changes (like inflation in Kenya) undermined the real value of the intervention, effectively concealing efficiency gains. It illustrates the need for operational processes that adjust interventions according to local factors, which in turn can influence cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that adapts charity interventions to a local economic factor—in this case, inflation in Kenya. By indexing transfers to inflation, GiveDirectly aims to ensure that the effective value of transfers remains consistent, thereby supporting sustained cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a location-specific operational adjustment where functions are geographically separated (Kampala vs. Mbale). Although it does not explicitly mention cost‐effectiveness, such a separation can reduce internal collusion or fraud, which in turn may improve overall cost-efficiency of the intervention.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where the intervention was adjusted based on a location-specific issue (high levels of gaming in a specific village). By pausing transfers until the issue is resolved, GiveDirectly aims to prevent misallocation of funds—a step that can indirectly support cost-effectiveness even though the direct financial impact is not explicitly discussed.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that adjusts the intervention to a location-specific factor (lack of mobile-payment infrastructure) by employing alternative distribution methods. Such adaptations can avoid the cost of building new infrastructure and leverage local resources, thereby contributing potentially to a more cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an experimental modification of the operational process aimed at reducing costs by streamlining interactions and verification steps. By simplifying the process and reducing the number of interactions, the organization seeks to lower operational costs, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to Rwanda’s specific regulatory and contextual environment, optimizing processes like registration and hiring. Such adaptations to location-specific factors are implied to contribute to cost-effectiveness by streamlining operations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the organization deliberately adjusts its intervention strategy based on location-specific factors—focusing on areas where it already operates—to increase cost efficiency, thereby directly linking tailored operational decisions with cost-effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly adjusted its operational processes (slowing enrollment) to allow for the collection of baseline information prior to the intervention. Although the quote does not explicitly link this to cost effectiveness, it implies that pre-intervention data collection can necessitate and influence operational adjustments that may contribute to more efficient, evidence-based program implementation.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention data collection—specifically the baseline survey conducted by the GE study—directly influenced operational processes by necessitating a delay in the intervention (token transfers). The decision to delay transfers in order to complete the baseline survey shows how collecting information ahead of an intervention can shape operational timelines and decisions, which in turn may affect overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention information through focus groups to understand community vulnerabilities (e.g., the significance of widows as a vulnerable group). This early collection of data influenced the development of new targeting criteria, reflecting an operational process adjustment that could promote cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are allocated based on informed, locally relevant insights.
