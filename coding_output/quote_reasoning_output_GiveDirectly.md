## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:
* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
* Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
* Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
* Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
* Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusted its operational procedures in Uganda in response to local conditions and challenges, using measures (such as job separation and payment audits) that have already been applied in Kenya. These targeted changes reflect a strategy of tailoring interventions to the specific operational environment of a location, which can affect cost effectiveness by reducing fraud and ensuring proper use of resources.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is actively evaluating the geographic and cultural characteristics of its operational areas. By considering expansion into regions with different ethnic compositions, the charity is adjusting its intervention strategy to manage political perceptions and biases, which can have implications for both operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly is differentiating its approach based on country-specific characteristics: using Uganda as a testing ground for experimental projects and as a backup option, while maintaining a more efficient model in Kenya. The deliberate choice to adjust funding sources and pilot project strategies in Uganda reflects a nuanced adaptation of intervention strategies aimed at maximizing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Another partnership GiveDirectly explored was working with two large multilateral organizations to set up a comparison between cash transfers and cows in one country. GiveDirectly believed that while the potential for impact on government policy and recipient outcomes was high, the risks of moving into an unfamiliar area and using unfamiliar payment systems were too great. It was also unclear whether a large enough sample could be assembled for the cash transfer arm to constitute a scientifically credible study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly actively evaluates the risks of entering new locations with unfamiliar systems. By deciding against such partnerships due to location-specific logistical challenges, the charity adjusts its intervention strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its targeting mechanism based on local housing characteristics. In areas where traditional indicators (like thatched roofs) are not prevalent, the charity adapts its eligibility criteria to better identify extreme poverty, thereby optimizing resource allocation and improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention parameters—in this case, the cash transfer amount—in response to local economic conditions such as inflation. By indexing transfer sizes to inflation, GiveDirectly maintains cost effectiveness and ensures that the intervention remains adequately calibrated to the local economic environment.

- **Quote:** **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention strategy in locations with limited mobile-payment infrastructure by modifying its cash transfer distribution model. The adaptation leverages local conditions to avoid building costly infrastructure, directly addressing the research question on tailoring interventions for cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates a strategic shift in geographic allocation based on regulatory and operational conditions in different countries. By reallocating funds to Rwanda in response to challenges in Uganda, GiveDirectly shows how it adjusts interventions based on local environments to mitigate risk and potentially improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt shows that GiveDirectly tailors its beneficiary selection criteria based on local feedback and conditions. Such modifications in targeting reflect an adaptive intervention strategy that leverages local insights to enhance operational efficiency and potentially achieve greater cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention strategy based on the geographic characteristics of its operational areas. By choosing to focus on locations where they already work because of larger target populations and lower setup costs, the charity is aiming to achieve cost effectiveness in its operations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational approach based on the local context. The specific reference to Rwanda’s regulatory environment and the corresponding rapid capacity-building efforts indicate an adjustment in strategy tailored to local conditions, which can indirectly contribute to operational cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly deliberately adjusted its operational timeline to allow for the collection of baseline information before full intervention. This pre-intervention data collection is an intentional process that likely informs decisions, contributing to more efficient and cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly's process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks).
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly’s operational structure is divided into distinct phases – including the census phase, which represents pre-intervention data collection. Embedding information collection in its process suggests that such practices help it plan and execute interventions in a systematic and potentially cost-effective manner.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the practice of collecting pre-intervention information (via the baseline survey) directly influences operational processes. In order to maintain the integrity of the collected data and the study's randomization, GiveDirectly had to alter its operational timeline by delaying transfers. This adjustment in the operational process, necessitated by pre-intervention data collection, indirectly affects cost-effectiveness by ensuring that interventions are implemented under controlled and efficient conditions.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collects information from focus groups prior to fully implementing new targeting criteria. By incorporating pre-intervention feedback on local vulnerabilities, the organization refines its operational processes, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness by better targeting resources to those most in need.
