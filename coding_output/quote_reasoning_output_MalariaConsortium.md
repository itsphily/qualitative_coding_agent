## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where Malaria Consortium adapts its approach to a location’s specific context by engaging local partners. By calibrating its strategy to local capacities and connecting projects, the organization likely increases impact and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: 'Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?' We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights a continuous monitoring and evaluation approach that helps the organization adjust interventions based on evidence. Though it does not mention location-specific adaptation explicitly, this rigorous inquiry process supports refining efforts to improve effectiveness, a key aspect of achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its intervention methods based on local characteristics such as mobile populations and migration patterns. By calibrating their approach to address these location-specific challenges, the organization likely enhances efficiency—and thereby cost-effectiveness—by reducing waste and ensuring that resources are targeted where they are most needed.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the use of location-specific operational adjustments by leveraging established local tools. Adapting the registration process to fit the local context minimizes duplication of effort and reduces implementation costs, which contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how location-specific factors are considered in selecting countries for intervention, illustrating a form of calibration in the charity's operational process. By choosing regions based on their malaria burden and operational readiness, the organization aims to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence of an operational process that leverages established local infrastructure and relationships to adapt interventions to the local context. Such adaptation is key to achieving cost-effectiveness by enabling efficient and targeted campaign implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO):

The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas:
- where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months;
- where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season);
- where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the specific criteria used to determine where SMC should be implemented. It shows that the intervention is tailored to local epidemiological and climatic conditions, a key operational process that ensures resources are directed to areas with the highest need and potential effectiveness, thus contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that Malaria Consortium calibrates its approach by systematically assessing location-specific factors before implementing the intervention. By adapting its strategy to the local malaria burden and seasonal patterns, the charity maximizes intervention effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention step where detailed information (through pretesting in different countries) was collected to refine the data collection tool. By optimizing the SMC card design before full implementation, the organization likely reduced future errors and inefficiencies, an approach that can contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness in operational processes.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that Malaria Consortium proactively gathered detailed contextual information by reviewing and adapting existing household registration tools. Pre-testing and adapting these tools before full-scale implementation aid in streamlining the operation, reducing the need for developing new systems from scratch, which can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a pre-intervention activity where detailed data regarding the funding situation is collected. It directly shows how gathering comprehensive information prior to executing an intervention can help in identifying potential funding gaps and thus guide cost-effective allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities. Mass LLIN distributions are one of the most cost-effective interventions we've identified for saving lives.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links the scoping work—done before the intervention—to the identification of cost-effective funding opportunities. It illustrates that analyzing detailed information pre-intervention can directly contribute to ensuring the intervention is financially efficient and aligned with the charity’s cost-effectiveness goals.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote suggests that setting a defined scope and timeline for pre-intervention data collection, even with minimal funding, enhances the priority given to the activity. This improved prioritization can lead to more effective operational processes, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity's intervention strategy.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates that Malaria Consortium collects detailed pre-intervention data on factors such as disease burden and environmental conditions. By doing so, it can target its intervention to areas where SMC is most needed and likely to be effective, which is a critical step to ensuring that operational processes are cost effective.
