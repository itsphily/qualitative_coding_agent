## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium adapts its operational approach based on local context—partnering with local community-based organizations and government facilities—to enhance collaboration and possibly improve cost effectiveness by leveraging localized expertise and resources.

- **Quote:** We ask questions such as: 'Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?' We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where detailed, context-specific data is collected to understand local challenges in intervention uptake, suggesting that these insights could be used to adjust interventions in a way that improves resource allocation and potentially increases overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a process of using local, context-specific feedback (such as health worker attrition and motivation) to pilot and then scale effective solutions. By tailoring interventions based on these on-the-ground details, the organization can potentially enhance operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In certain areas, the surveys observed migration patterns that had not previously been described, which were largely due to agricultural practices. Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration. On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly describes how Malaria Consortium adjusted its operational processes based on location-specific details—such as migration patterns and mobile populations—by modifying implementation guides, synchronizing intervention phases, and mapping migrant groups. While the text does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, these tailored operational adjustments are likely to improve resource utilization and reduce inefficiencies, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how Malaria Consortium leverages local, existing household registration tools to adapt and simplify its data collection processes. By using tools already established in the geographic context, the organization likely saves on development costs and improves operational efficiency, which are important factors in enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains how the charity selects intervention locations by analyzing local, location-specific factors (malaria burden, transmission season timing, existing operational capacity). Such targeted decision-making suggests that adapting interventions based on local details can improve cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed to areas of greatest need and readiness.

- **Quote:** Nigeria, Uganda, and Mozambique have high rates of malaria transmission. Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the charity's operational process includes leveraging established local relationships and infrastructure. By utilizing these location-specific assets, the charity is better positioned to deploy interventions efficiently, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity uses detailed, location‐specific data—examining factors such as local malaria burden, transmission, and rainfall—to tailor its intervention to the local context. By targeting areas where seasonal malaria transmission is high, the charity can deploy resources more efficiently, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium's SMC work varies by country, but in general includes the following activities.53 Determining the quantity of drugs needed, procurement of drugs, and international shipping54 Procurement and distribution of other SMC commodities55 Funding distributions, including in-country storage and transportation of drugs and payments to front-line distributors to compensate them for the time they spend on the program Technical assistance and logistical support for training SMC implementers, targeted supervision, community engagement and social and behavior change, drug safety, and review of prior implementation and revisions to procedures
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the charity adjusts its operational processes based on country-specific conditions. By varying activities such as procurement, local distribution, and community engagement according to the local context, Malaria Consortium is able to optimize the use of resources, which contributes to a lower cost per child covered and improves the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly illustrates a pre-intervention activity where data was collected to assess the funding landscape for LLIN campaigns before the intervention was implemented, directly tying into how pre-intervention data collection supports operational processes to enable cost-effective strategies.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that by setting a defined scope and timeline for pre-intervention data collection, the organization’s operational processes are influenced to prioritize initiatives, thereby laying the groundwork for more cost-effective actions.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote exemplifies how pre-intervention data is collected to evaluate the context of a charitable cause—here, the burden and patterns of malaria—allowing Malaria Consortium to strategically target areas where the intervention is most needed. This targeted approach is essential for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the use of baseline pre-intervention data to assess factors (such as drug resistance) which could influence the effectiveness of the intervention. By incorporating such data into its operational models (e.g., adjusting cost-effectiveness estimates), the organization can make informed decisions that enhance the overall cost efficiency of its programs.
