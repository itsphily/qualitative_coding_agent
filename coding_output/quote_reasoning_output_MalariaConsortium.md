## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how Malaria Consortium adjusts its intervention strategies by actively engaging local actors and government bodies, ensuring that the approach is tailored to local contexts. Engaging local organizations can optimize resource use and enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization deliberately incorporates local stakeholders into its interventions and uses data-driven approaches, suggesting an operational process of tailoring activities to specific local conditions to improve overall effectiveness and potentially reduce costs.

- **Quote:** As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows an operational process where the charity probes into contextual factors affecting intervention uptake (e.g., net usage and barriers), indicating that they adjust strategies based on local feedback, which is crucial for cost effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an adaptive operational process where interventions are piloted based on local workforce conditions. By testing different solutions and scaling the successful ones, the charity tailors its strategy to local needs, which can enhance cost effectiveness through improved intervention impact.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly illustrates how Malaria Consortium adjusted its intervention strategies based on local contextual specifics, such as addressing mobile and migrant populations. These tailored operational adjustments are designed to enhance the efficiency—and thereby the cost effectiveness—of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates another example of operational process adjustment by leveraging locally established systems to streamline household registration. By adapting to the local context, the organization can optimize resource use and potentially enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains that the selection of intervention locations was based on specific local contextual factors such as malaria burden, seasonal overlap, and existing operational presence. This indicates an adjustment in the intervention strategy to leverage local specifics for potentially enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how the charity’s pre-existing local infrastructures and relationships serve as a foundation for adjusting its strategy. By leveraging these local connections, the organization is better positioned to implement targeted interventions, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity uses local environmental and epidemiological data (rainfall, malaria transmission, and incidence) to decide where and how to implement its interventions, thereby tailoring its strategy to fit local contexts which in turn enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that the charity adjusts operational details such as community distributor remuneration based on differing economic conditions in various countries, an adjustment that can directly affect cost efficiency in delivering the intervention.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational adaptation where training materials are translated into local languages, ensuring that the intervention is culturally and linguistically appropriate for the target population, thus contributing to effective and cost-effective program delivery.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects the charity's ongoing process of refining its intervention strategy based on local epidemiological and contextual factors, which is a proactive approach to optimizing cost effectiveness by tailoring the intervention to local needs.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests. Once a final version was created, Malaria Consortium used monitoring tools to test the card's efficacy as a means of measuring coverage during its project in Katsina State, Nigeria, which was a smaller-scale intervention in a more controlled environment than its current programs. In this context, the cards seemed to give a good sense of the rates of completion of the treatment regimen. However, Malaria Consortium staff recognize that there are limitations to this approach, which is why they began using the rapid assessments that are currently being used.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention effort wherein Malaria Consortium collected and utilized feedback from testing its SMC cards in different settings. By modifying the cards based on this collected information, the organization tailored its monitoring tools to better capture coverage data—a process that informs operational decisions and contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that prior to full implementation, Malaria Consortium actively gathered information on existing registration practices and tested its adapted tool. This pre-intervention data collection allowed them to streamline the household registration process, an operational step that supports efficient and cost-effective program delivery.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly outlines a pre-intervention data collection effort, where information on the funding situation is gathered to inform which areas might offer cost-effective intervention opportunities and thus shape the charity’s operational priorities.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights that the pre-intervention scoping work is viewed as a means to uncover funding opportunities that are cost effective, linking the collected information directly to the operational decision-making processes aimed at achieving efficient outcomes.

- **Quote:** We believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains that by establishing a defined scope and timeline for collecting information before the intervention, the charity’s operational processes are influenced—in this case, by increasing the prioritization of the project, which can lead to more cost-effective implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium collects detailed baseline data before intervention rollout. By assessing disease burden and environmental factors in target areas prior to implementation, they can tailor their operational processes—such as intervention targeting and resource allocation—to maximize coverage and cost effectiveness.
