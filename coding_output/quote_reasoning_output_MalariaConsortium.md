## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its interventions to the specific local context by partnering with local organizations and government entities. Although it does not explicitly mention 'cost effectiveness,' the approach implies that leveraging local networks can enhance the operational impact and potentially lower costs through community engagement and resource sharing.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project.
- **Reasoning:** By emphasizing partnerships with local actors and ensuring knowledge transfer, this quote signals an adaptive operational process that tailors interventions to local conditions. This process, while not explicitly linked with cost savings, suggests enhanced sustainability and efficiency which are core aspects of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process where local challenges are identified and addressed through piloting different solutions. By testing and scaling only those interventions that work in the local context, Malaria Consortium is effectively adapting its strategy, which may lead to better resource utilization and improved cost effectiveness over time.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its intervention to the specific characteristics of each location by modifying implementation guides and distribution strategies based on observed migration patterns and local population dynamics. Such tailored operational adjustments likely contribute to cost effectiveness by addressing local challenges and reducing inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another example of adapting the intervention to local conditions by leveraging existing tools and systems within the community. By customizing the household registration process to fit local practices, the organization can streamline operations and reduce redundancy, which in turn enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity selects locations based on distinct local characteristics—such as disease burden, seasonal trends, and existing operational capacity—which implies that intervening in a manner tailored to each country's specific conditions is seen as a strategy to enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote points to leveraging existing, location-specific infrastructure and relationships as part of the operational process. Tailoring interventions to utilize established local networks supports the notion that adapting the charity’s approach to local conditions enhances the efficient and cost-effective delivery of the intervention.

- **Quote:** The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas:
- where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months;
- where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season);
- where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines how SMC deployment is based on location-specific factors such as seasonal rainfall and malaria incidence. By targeting areas that meet these criteria, the intervention is tailored to the local epidemiological profile, ensuring that resources are concentrated where they will have the greatest impact, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium undertakes thorough local assessments before implementation. By adapting its intervention based on detailed local data, the charity ensures that its program fits the specific characteristics of each area—a key operational process that contributes to improved cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the charity adjusts operational costs (such as payments for community distributors) based on local economic conditions. This form of adaptation helps optimize resource allocation and minimizes unnecessary expenditures, thereby bolstering the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests. Once a final version was created, Malaria Consortium used monitoring tools to test the card's efficacy as a means of measuring coverage during its project in Katsina State, Nigeria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes a pre-intervention data collection process—pretesting a tool (SMC card) before its full implementation. The modification based on initial data collection illustrates how early feedback was used to refine operational processes, which can be inferred to contribute to more cost‐effective program implementation.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the use of pre-intervention examinations of existing data collection tools to inform tool adaptation. By pre-testing and simplifying the household registration tool using already available resources, Malaria Consortium demonstrates an operational process that leverages pre-intervention data to streamline activities—a strategy that likely enhances cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly delineates a pre-intervention data collection activity, where information is gathered on funding gaps before any LLIN campaign is implemented. It directly ties into how collecting such data allows the organization to set priorities, an operational process that can contribute to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that by formalizing the pre-intervention data collection (through a small grant and a fixed timeline), the organization’s operational processes are influenced—ensuring that the scoping work is prioritized, which in turn informs decisions that lead to more cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS‐SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a clear example of pre-intervention data collection. By assessing factors such as disease burden, transmission patterns, and rainfall, Malaria Consortium gathered critical baseline evidence that informs operational decisions—ensuring that SMC is deployed in areas where it is most likely to be effective. This targeted approach enhances the cost‐effectiveness of its interventions.
