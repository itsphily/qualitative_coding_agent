## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a tailored operational approach where Malaria Consortium adapts its intervention to the local context by partnering with local organizations and government facilities. Such local calibration likely enhances the efficiency and impact of projects, aligning with the research question's focus on adapting to specific location conditions.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: 'Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?' We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines how the organization uses intense monitoring and evaluation to refine its intervention processes. By continuously assessing and questioning the effectiveness of interventions (such as mass net distribution), Malaria Consortium tailors its operations based on actual local challenges, a method that can improve both impact and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of how tailored interventions are developed through piloting solutions that address specific local needs (such as high attrition rates among health workers). By testing and scaling effective local solutions, the organization is able to optimize its operational processes, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness by deploying only proven, efficient strategies.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:
* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
* Rapid post-cycle surveys, which are implemented in the first and third treatment cycles as a quality assurance measure immediately post-cycle to identify missed households. This was also used as an additional data point to triangulate and validate the findings from coverage surveys that are conducted at the end of the transmission season.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly outlines how Malaria Consortium tailors its operational processes to the specific local conditions—such as addressing mobility and migration patterns—by making concrete adjustments (e.g., setting up mobile fixed distribution sites, synchronizing cycles across borders, and engaging with migrant populations). Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, such targeted adaptations are designed to optimize resource use and improve delivery efficiency, which in turn likely enhances overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium calibrates its operational processes by leveraging local resources and pre-existing systems. By adapting and simplifying registration tools based on what is already in use within specific regions, the charity tailors its intervention to local conditions, which can reduce redundancies and lower costs, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention by selecting specific countries based on local conditions such as malaria burden, campaign timing, and existing operational presence. Such calibration of operational processes to suit local needs is an example of how adaptation can enhance overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of adaptive operational strategies, highlighting the use of locally established infrastructure and relationships. By leveraging these pre-existing assets, the charity can more efficiently deploy interventions, which in turn may lead to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity tailors its intervention by first assessing local environmental and epidemiological conditions. By understanding local malaria burden, rainfall, and transmission patterns, the charity can calibrate its operational processes to target areas where the intervention will be most effective, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the charity adjusts key operational inputs such as payment for community distributors based on local economic conditions. Tailoring compensation to local contexts helps ensure efficient resource allocation and supports cost-effective program implementation.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention activity where data collection tools (SMC cards) were tested and refined before the full-scale intervention. By validating and modifying the tool in advance, the organization enhances operational reliability and potentially reduces resource wastage, which contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a pre-intervention approach where the organization gathered and evaluated existing data collection instruments (household registration tools) prior to implementation. Pre-testing and adapting these tools ensures smoother data collection during the intervention, optimizing resource use and thus supporting charity cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a pre-intervention data collection process where staff gather detailed information on funding gaps. It shows that the organization uses early data collection to identify funding opportunities, thereby contributing to cost-effectiveness by targeting resources where they can have the greatest impact.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities. Mass LLIN distributions are one of the most cost-effective interventions we've identified for saving lives.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the scoping (pre-intervention data collection) directly to the discovery of highly cost-effective funding opportunities, demonstrating that collecting data before intervention implementation is viewed as a strategic operational process for enhancing charity cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.60
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides clear evidence of pre-intervention data collection. By assessing critical epidemiological factors before launching the intervention, Malaria Consortium was able to target areas where malaria is highly seasonal and burdensome. This operational process ensures that resources are allocated effectively, thereby contributing to the charity’s overall cost effectiveness.
