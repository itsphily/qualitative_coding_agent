## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of how Malaria Consortium calibrates its operational processes by adapting interventions to local contexts—in this case, by partnering with local community-based organizations and government health facilities rather than international organizations. The reference to "delivering greater impact" suggests these tailored approaches are intended to enhance overall effectiveness, a concept closely related to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes a systematic, data-driven approach that involves partnering with local actors and applying rigorous monitoring and evaluation. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the process of drilling down to identify local barriers and tailoring the intervention accordingly is a clear indicator of how the organization adjusts its operations to align with local specifics, which can lead to more cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a calibration process in action: by piloting various solutions based on evidence gathered from local conditions (such as health worker attrition), the organization adapts its interventions to effectively meet local needs. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, scaling up only the successful, locally tailored solutions implies a focus on enhancing efficiency and impact.

- **Quote:** In certain areas, the surveys observed migration patterns that had not previously been described, which were largely due to agricultural practices. Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration. On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
* Rapid post-cycle surveys, which are implemented in the first and third treatment cycles as a quality assurance measure immediately post-cycle to identify missed households. This was also used as an additional data point to triangulate and validate the findings from coverage surveys that are conducted at the end of the transmission season.
- **Reasoning:** This passage directly documents how Malaria Consortium calibrates its operational processes by modifying its intervention methods to align with local specifics—such as migration patterns and mobile populations—thereby tailoring their approach to the unique contexts of different areas. However, while it clearly illustrates calibration based on local characteristics, it does not provide direct evidence linking these modifications to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium is looking to incorporate more reliable approaches to data collection into its model, but is also conscious of the fact that its monitoring methods need to be scalable and need to have the potential to be handed over to the ministries of health. Some ideas have been suggested, such as using intelligent blister packs that record the time they were opened and/or change color when they are opened. Malaria Consortium is exploring these ideas while trying to find ways to keep costs manageable.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the organization is actively exploring solutions to improve scalability and management of costs, indicating a concern for cost management. However, it does not offer direct evidence that the tailored modifications based on local interventions result in enhanced cost effectiveness, leaving a gap in direct support for that second component of the research question.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that the organization tailors its operational processes by selecting specific locations based on multiple local factors (malaria burden, seasonal timing, existing staff presence). These considerations imply a deliberate modification of interventions to align with the specifics of each location, a strategy that is linked to enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that the charity has developed localized operational infrastructures and partnerships. Leveraging these local assets enables the organization to more effectively target interventions where they are most needed, indicating a calibration of operational processes that supports cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS‐SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that the charity calibrates its operational processes by conducting location-specific assessments. By evaluating local malaria burden and environmental factors, Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention rollout to the unique conditions of each country, which is a foundational strategy for enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years. See this spreadsheet for a list of Malaria Consortium's SMC operational research projects in 2019.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity actively experiments with and modifies its intervention protocols based on local conditions. The operational research into adjusting SMC cycles and eligibility criteria is a clear example of calibrating the intervention to achieve better outcomes and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages, in order to check for these issues.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a tailored operational process where training materials are adapted for linguistic and cultural context. By ensuring that job aids and checklists are translated into local languages, the intervention is better aligned with the specifics of each location, potentially leading to improved implementation quality and cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the organization conducted pre-intervention data collection by testing and refining its SMC card tool. Such a process allows for adjustments based on real-world feedback, ultimately leading to operational efficiencies and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that prior to full implementation, the organization gathered and utilized pre-existing information on household registration methods to adapt and simplify its own tool. By leveraging established systems and pre-testing their design, Malaria Consortium enhances its operational process, which can lead to more cost-effective intervention delivery.

- **Quote:** Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that the charity collected key contextual information by mapping and engaging with specific target populations before the intervention. This preparatory work allows the organization to tailor its delivery strategy to local dynamics, thereby improving operational efficiency and potentially reducing costs.

- **Quote:** Planned activities

The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that pre-intervention data collection was undertaken to assess funding situations and set priorities. This process is intended to inform subsequent operational decisions, thereby contributing to cost-effective planning in charitable interventions.

- **Quote:** We decided to recommend this grant for the following reasons:
* Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote makes a clear link between the act of collecting information (scoping efforts) before an intervention and identifying opportunities that align with cost-effectiveness criteria. It supports the research question by illustrating how such pre-intervention data collection can inform operational processes geared towards maximizing impact.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.60
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium collected detailed information about malaria burden and transmission patterns prior to implementing its intervention under the ACCESS-SMC program. By assessing these factors beforehand, the charity was able to target areas where its intervention would be most effective, thereby optimizing resource allocation and enhancing cost effectiveness through informed operational planning.
