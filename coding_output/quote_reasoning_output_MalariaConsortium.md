## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process tailored to a specific location (Uganda) where the charity adapts its intervention by leveraging local community-based organizations and government health facilities. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the approach of partnering locally to deliver greater impact suggests that such location-specific adjustments may contribute to reducing overheads and improving overall intervention efficiency.

- **Quote:** Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that modifies the intervention based on local population mobility. By adjusting implementation guides to set up mobile fixed distribution sites, the charity tailors its intervention to location-specific conditions, which likely improves efficiency and contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity coordinates its operations across different geographical regions. By synchronizing its implementation phase, it reduces unnecessary movement of individuals across districts and borders, which in turn minimizes redundant resource use and supports cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that uses local, location-specific data to design intervention delivery. By mapping migrant populations and establishing fixed delivery points based on known routes, the charity ensures that services are efficiently targeted, reducing waste and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium adjusts its intervention based on specific local factors—malaria burden, seasonal overlap with COVID-19, campaign schedules, and existing staff presence—which is a clear example of using location-specific details to prioritize efforts, a process that can drive cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how having pre-existing local operational infrastructure and partnerships allows the charity to effectively target interventions to areas of need, thereby optimizing resource deployment and enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity employs a location-specific operational process by assessing local epidemiological and environmental conditions before intervention deployment. By tailoring their approach based on regional malaria burden and seasonal variations, Malaria Consortium targets areas where SMC is likely to be most effective, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO): The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas: - where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months; - where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season); - where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the location-specific criteria established by WHO, which in turn inform the operational processes of Malaria Consortium. By deploying SMC only in areas meeting these detailed local conditions, the charity ensures that resources are concentrated in high-impact regions, thereby optimizing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adjustment based on local economic conditions. By varying community distributor payments according to country-specific wage levels, the charity can better manage operational costs, which contributes to higher cost effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention activity in which a data collection tool (the SMC card) was pretested and refined based on feedback. Such pre-intervention data collection helps ensure that operational processes (like accurate coverage measurement) are reliable, thereby contributing indirectly to cost-effective resource allocation.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of pre-intervention efforts to gather and evaluate existing data collection mechanisms. By pre-testing and adapting a household registration tool, Malaria Consortium aimed to streamline data collection processes. This operational improvement can enhance efficiency and reduce costs by leveraging existing infrastructure rather than building new systems from scratch.

- **Quote:** Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This passage, though presented as part of a list of improvements, reflects a pre-intervention process where data about population movements was collected ahead of the intervention. This mapping and pre-engagement enabled better planning of mobile delivery sites, which is an operational strategy likely to improve cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes a pre-intervention data collection activity aimed at gathering detailed information about the funding status of LLIN campaigns. Such data collection is used to inform which areas require further funding, thereby contributing to operational processes that enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This statement links the scoping (pre-intervention data collection) directly with uncovering funding gaps that are likely to be cost effective. It illustrates how early data gathering supports decision-making and prioritization in operational processes for charity interventions.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection effort where the charity gathered detailed contextual information (malaria burden, transmission dynamics, rainfall patterns, and seasonality) before launching the intervention. Such data collection informs where SMC will be most effective, thereby guiding operational planning and resource allocation to enhance cost-effectiveness.
