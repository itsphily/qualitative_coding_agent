## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium tailors its operational approach based on the local context by choosing to partner with local entities rather than international organizations. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, leveraging local infrastructure and partnerships suggests a strategy designed to improve efficiency and potentially lower costs, aligning with the research question on location-specific adaptation enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underlines the importance of partnering with local actors to ensure knowledge transfer and local ownership. By adapting interventions to the specific local context, the operational process not only fosters sustainability but also implies a potential for enhanced cost effectiveness through reduced reliance on external resources, which ties into the research question.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the organization pilots a variety of locally tailored solutions to address specific operational challenges (such as health worker retention) and subsequently scales up successful interventions with government support. This adaptive, evidence-based process, while not directly mentioning cost effectiveness, suggests that tailoring interventions to specific local needs can optimize resource allocation and operational efficiencies, which is central to the research question.

- **Quote:** Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly illustrates how Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention to the unique dynamics of different locations – addressing factors such as mobile populations and migration patterns. Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, these adaptive operational processes likely enhance efficiency and reduce wastage by better aligning the intervention with local needs, thereby improving overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates the charity’s process of adapting its tools to the local context by leveraging existing systems. By tailoring household registration methods to each specific location, the organization can streamline operations and potentially lower implementation costs, thereby serving as an operational process that enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention by selecting specific countries based on contextual local factors such as disease burden, timing of transmission, and existing operational presence. This adaptation to local specifics is an operational process likely intended to enhance cost effectiveness, as resources are concentrated where they are most needed and operationally efficient.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the importance of leveraging pre-existing local infrastructure and partnerships to adapt interventions according to regional conditions, which can streamline implementation and potentially lower costs, thus enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium customizes its intervention by gathering detailed local epidemiological and environmental data prior to implementation. By identifying areas with seasonal malaria and high burden, the charity ensures that the intervention is deployed where it will have the most impact relative to its cost, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Pilot and scale-up of SMC in northern Nigeria: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) provided about $1.7 million to Malaria Consortium to do operational research on the best way to deliver SMC at scale in Katsina state in northern Nigeria, and then to implement its chosen delivery system and assess its efficiency and impact.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium conducts location-specific operational research to determine the optimal delivery method for the intervention. By tailoring the delivery system to the local conditions in northern Nigeria, the organization is able to enhance efficiency and maximize impact relative to expenditure, contributing to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the charity adapts its cost structure to local economic conditions by varying the payment for community distributors (CDs) according to the setting. This level of operational adaptation helps in controlling costs and aligning resources with local market rates, thereby bolstering the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention data collection was a planned activity, where information was gathered on the funding landscape for LLIN campaigns. The collected data was intended to inform decision-making and prioritize subsequent interventions, contributing to operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This statement directly links the pre-intervention scoping work—essentially a form of data collection—with the identification of interventions that are cost-effective. It suggests that gathering detailed pre-intervention information can reveal opportunities that maximize impact relative to cost.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that formalizing the pre-intervention data collection through funding and setting a clear scope and timeline enhanced organizational prioritization. By ensuring that the scoping work was given focused attention, the charity was better positioned to execute subsequent interventions in a cost-effective manner.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that Malaria Consortium collects pre-intervention data - in this case, detailed assessments of malaria burden and environmental factors - which is used to target its interventions to areas where they are most needed. This data-driven targeting is an operational process that contributes to the program’s cost-effectiveness by ensuring resources are deployed where the impact is maximized.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that a baseline study on drug resistance markers was conducted before the intervention cycles began. By collecting this pre-intervention data, Malaria Consortium can monitor potential challenges (like emerging drug resistance) and adjust its operational strategies accordingly, which helps maintain and enhance the cost-effectiveness of its interventions.
