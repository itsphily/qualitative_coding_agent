## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the organization tailors its approach by engaging directly with local actors (e.g., local CBOs and district-level government health facilities) in Uganda. Such local partnerships indicate an operational process where interventions are adapted to the specific local context, a strategy likely aimed at increasing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores the importance of local engagement by partnering with government or local actors. By tailoring the operational process to include local stakeholders, the organization aims to achieve sustainable outcomes and efficient use of resources, aligning with the idea of enhancing cost effectiveness through location-specific customization.

- **Quote:** As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the organization's commitment to understanding and addressing context-specific challenges—by interrogating detailed aspects of net usage and barriers, they create a feedback loop that can inform the tailoring of interventions to local needs. This process of continuous evaluation and adjustment is an operational method that can contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration. On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention by adapting its implementation methods to local migration patterns and mobile populations. By adjusting guides, synchronizing phases across borders, and mapping migrant populations, the organization customizes its operational process to local characteristics, which potentially enhances cost effectiveness by ensuring the intervention reaches the right populations efficiently.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates another way the organization tailors its interventions by leveraging local resources. By adapting and simplifying household registration tools that are already in use in the target communities, Malaria Consortium streamlines its processes, which likely enhances cost effectiveness through reduced duplication of effort and better alignment with local operational contexts.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how Malaria Consortium tailors its intervention by selecting countries based on specific local characteristics (such as malaria burden, campaign timelines, and local staffing), which aligns with the research question regarding the customization of interventions to enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the charity leverages pre-existing local relationships and infrastructures, highlighting an operational process where intervention strategies are customized to local contexts to potentially improve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO):

The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas:
- where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months;
- where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season);
- where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.10
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the criteria used to determine whether an area is appropriate for SMC. It shows that the intervention is tailored to local epidemiological characteristics—such as rainfall patterns and malaria incidence—ensuring that the program is deployed where it will be most effective, which is central to enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This statement provides concrete evidence of an operational process in which the charity gathers local data and conducts assessments to tailor its intervention. By identifying areas with high malaria burden and seasonal transmission, this planning helps optimize resource allocation and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages,27 in order to check for these issues.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization adapts its operational tools to the local context (e.g., using local languages). Such tailoring of training materials to the specific linguistic and cultural characteristics of each location is an important aspect of ensuring that interventions are implemented effectively and cost efficiently.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that before fully launching their intervention, Malaria Consortium engaged in collecting baseline data by leveraging and adapting existing household registration tools. Although it does not directly state cost-effectiveness, pre-testing and integrating pre-intervention data collection can streamline operational processes and reduce redundancies, which can contribute to more cost-effective program implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides clear evidence of a pre-intervention data collection activity, where information is gathered before any LLIN campaign is implemented. It demonstrates how such pre-intervention data gathering is used to identify funding gaps and set priorities, thereby informing the operational processes that aim to enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that by pre-defining the scope and timeline for the data collection (scoping) exercise, the organization is more likely to commit and prioritize the activity. This prioritization, instituted even before the intervention begins, is an element of the operational process that can improve cost-effectiveness by ensuring that decision-making and resource allocation are timely and strategically informed.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium collected baseline data before implementing its intervention in order to identify areas with high seasonal malaria burden. Using this pre-intervention assessment, the charity is able to target regions where its efforts will have the most impact, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently and thereby contributing to cost‐effective operations.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC. A follow-up survey was conducted in 2017, following two rounds of SMC.
- **Reasoning:** The initial part of this quote refers to a baseline study—a pre-intervention data collection effort—to evaluate drug resistance levels. Gathering such pre-intervention data is crucial for setting benchmarks and informing operational decisions (for example, adjusting drug protocols), which helps maintain the intervention's effectiveness and cost efficiency over time.
