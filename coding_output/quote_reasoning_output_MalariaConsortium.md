## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a location-specific modification in intervention strategy by opting to work with local community-based organizations and government facilities instead of international organizations. This tailored approach is an operational process to leverage local advantages, which can enhance cost effectiveness through improved local engagement and resource utilization.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project.
- **Reasoning:** By highlighting the strategy of partnering with local actors and the government, this quote shows how the intervention is modified to suit local conditions. The focus on knowledge transfer and building local capacity suggests an operational process that could reduce long-term costs and increase sustainability, aligning with the concept of enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process of modifying interventions based on local context—specifically addressing the retention challenges of health workers by piloting and then scaling up effective, locally-tailored solutions. Although cost effectiveness is not stated explicitly, adapting interventions in this way can improve resource use and reduce waste, thus enhancing cost effectiveness through evidence-based decision making.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:
* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
* Rapid post-cycle surveys, which are implemented in the first and third treatment cycles as a quality assurance measure immediately post-cycle to identify missed households. This was also used as an additional data point to triangulate and validate the findings from coverage surveys that are conducted at the end of the transmission season.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how Malaria Consortium modified its intervention to suit location-specific characteristics – addressing issues like mobile and migrant populations – by revising implementation guides, synchronizing phases across regions, and mapping local movement patterns. These operational adaptations suggest a process that can enhance cost effectiveness by ensuring that resources are directed efficiently and tailored to local needs.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity adapts its operational process by leveraging and modifying existing, location-specific tools for household registration. By doing so, it minimizes duplication of efforts and potentially reduces costs, which aligns with the idea of enhancing cost effectiveness through tailored intervention design.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the selection of intervention locations was based on specific local characteristics, such as high malaria burdens and existing staff presence. By tailoring the focus to these factors, the charity is using an operational process that potentially enhances cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed where the impact is likely to be greatest.

- **Quote:** Nigeria, Uganda, and Mozambique have high rates of malaria transmission. Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how existing local partnerships and infrastructure (location-specific attributes) can facilitate the deployment of interventions in a timely and cost-effective manner. It suggests that modifying the intervention to account for these local factors can enhance operational efficiency and overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium actively explores modifications to its intervention—for example, adjusting the number of treatment cycles or altering age eligibility—to better suit local epidemiological conditions. Such modifications suggest a deliberate operational process aimed at improving the intervention’s effectiveness and, by extension, its cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity undertakes comprehensive, location-specific assessments prior to implementation. By using local data such as transmission trends and seasonal variations, the organization tailors its intervention to areas where it can have the greatest impact, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness through targeted resource allocation.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly describes a pre-intervention data collection activity where resources are allocated to gather critical information about the funding landscape for LLIN campaigns before implementation, suggesting that such early data gathering can inform subsequent funding and operational decisions that enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This statement explicitly links the scoping (pre-intervention data collection) to the potential of uncovering funding opportunities that meet high cost-effectiveness standards, highlighting how early data collection can directly contribute to more efficient resource allocation.

- **Quote:** Based on these considerations, we believed it was possible that the funding opportunities identified as a result of this grant would be within the range of cost-effectiveness of our top charities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reinforces the idea that the insights obtained from pre-intervention data collection are expected to lead to funding opportunities that align with the established cost-effectiveness benchmarks of top charities, thereby supporting the argument that such early data integration into operational processes can drive overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity undertakes a pre-intervention data collection phase by assessing disease burden and seasonal patterns. This pre-assessment is used to target interventions to areas where they are most likely to be effective, thereby improving resource allocation and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This baseline study, conducted before subsequent intervention rounds, provides pre-intervention data on drug resistance. By understanding the initial state of drug efficacy, the charity can adjust its operational strategies and cost-effectiveness models to mitigate potential risks, contributing to more efficient use of resources.
