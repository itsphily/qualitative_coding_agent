## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how Malaria Consortium adjusts its operational processes by tailoring its approach to the local context—in this case, choosing to work with local community-based organizations and district-level government health facilities in Uganda rather than international organizations. Although it does not explicitly mention cost‐effectiveness, the reference to 'delivering greater impact' implies that these localized partnerships are intended to optimize outcomes and resource use, which is a likely contributor to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization tailors its interventions by partnering with local actors and by conducting in-depth monitoring and evaluation to pinpoint local barriers (for example, in net usage). This meticulous approach indicates an internal calibration of processes based on ground-level feedback, which while not directly linked to cost-effectiveness in the text, suggests that such adaptations are aimed at minimizing waste and improving operational efficiency—factors that contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In certain areas, the surveys observed migration patterns that had not previously been described, which were largely due to agricultural practices. Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration. On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:
* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium tailors its operational processes to address unique local characteristics—such as migration patterns and mobile populations—by adjusting implementation guides and synchronizing cross-border efforts. Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, these calibrated interventions can help reduce inefficiencies and better target resources, which is likely to contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the organization adapts its tools based on local feedback from various countries, indicating a tailoring of operational processes to different geographical contexts. While it does not directly address cost-effectiveness, the act of calibrating tools to the specific needs of different locations suggests an approach that potentially improves efficiency and reduces costs.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how the charity tailors its interventions by selecting locations based on unique characteristics such as malaria burden, campaign timelines, and local staffing capacity. It demonstrates an operational adjustment to fit local contexts, which is essential for achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the charity leverages pre-existing local relationships and infrastructure to adapt its operations to the specific environments of the target locations. Such tailored operational processes likely contribute to overall cost-effectiveness by reducing deployment barriers and enhancing efficiency.

- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO): The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas: - where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months; - where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season); - where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the intervention is tailored based on unique local characteristics such as rainfall patterns, transmission seasonality and malaria burden. By using these criteria to determine where SMC is deployed, the charity adjusts its operational processes to target areas of highest impact, which is a key factor in optimizing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of how the charity calibrates its interventions based on location-specific epidemiological data. By assessing local malaria burden and seasonal patterns, the charity tailors its operational approach to ensure that interventions are implemented in areas where they are most likely to be effective, thereby contributing to improved cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an example of how the charity adjusts its operational processes to fit local economic conditions. Varying the payment rates for community distributors according to country-specific contexts helps in managing program costs effectively, which in turn supports overall cost-effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.

- **Quote:** Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines Malaria Consortium’s operational process of using rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and research to analyze their interventions and establish best practices. It demonstrates how the organization collects and uses information to improve intervention effectiveness, which is related to achieving cost effectiveness. However, it does not specify that this data collection occurs before implementing interventions.

- **Quote:** Our technical expertise is our strength. We like to understand how things work rather than just going for the delivery of the intervention. My understanding of why donors come to us is that we're trusted as an organization that takes a fairly self-critical approach to finding out what works or doesn't work and applying that knowledge to improve the effectiveness of our initiatives.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reinforces the value placed on deep analytical approaches and learning from operational data to refine interventions, an approach that can underpin cost effectiveness. Nonetheless, it remains ambiguous as to whether this information is collected specifically before interventions are implemented.

- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium collected information (through pretesting) before fully implementing the SMC intervention, thereby improving their measurement tool. This pre-intervention process likely helps in optimizing operational procedures and reducing waste, which can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the process of gathering and adapting relevant pre-existing information and tools prior to the intervention. By leveraging and pre-testing household registration tools, the organization minimizes design flaws and redundant development efforts, which can enhance operational efficiency and contribute to cost effective implementation.

- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates the pre-intervention operational process—collecting information to assess funding gaps—which is intended to inform subsequent interventions. By gathering detailed funding data upfront, Malaria Consortium aims to identify where cost-effective opportunities exist, aligning with the research question on achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes that by formalizing and funding the pre-intervention information collection process (through defining scope and timeline), the charity can operationally prioritize the activity, thus enhancing its ability to allocate resources effectively and achieve cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates a pre-intervention information collection process undertaken by the charity. By gathering detailed baseline data on malaria burden and transmission patterns before launching the intervention, Malaria Consortium is able to strategically target regions where seasonal malaria chemoprevention will be most effective, thus contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We began speaking to Malaria Consortium about the possibility of reviewing one of its programs in January 2016. Over the next several months we tried to determine which of Malaria Consortium's programs we should prioritize evaluating for a possible recommendation, and we ultimately settled on seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an extensive pre-implementation information gathering process conducted by the evaluators. It underscores the importance of collecting comprehensive information before deciding on and implementing an intervention, thereby ensuring that the chosen program is both operationally sound and cost effective.
