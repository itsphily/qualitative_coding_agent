## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes to the local context by choosing local partners (CBOs and district health facilities in Uganda) instead of relying on international organizations, thereby tailoring interventions to specific location characteristics which can contribute to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process that emphasizes partnerships with local actors and a strong focus on monitoring and evaluation. Such rigorous review and feedback mechanisms enable the organization to adjust interventions based on local conditions and challenges, supporting the pursuit of cost-effectiveness by refining approaches over time.

- **Quote:** What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that the organization uses pilot testing to assess which interventions work in a given local context. By tailoring and scaling up only those solutions proven effective through local piloting, Malaria Consortium adjusts its interventions in a manner that can contribute to more cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** In certain areas, the surveys observed migration patterns that had not previously been described, which were largely due to agricultural practices. Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration. On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
* Rapid post-cycle surveys, which are implemented in the first and third treatment cycles as a quality assurance measure immediately post-cycle to identify missed households. This was also used as an additional data point to triangulate and validate the findings from coverage surveys that are conducted at the end of the transmission season.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows how the charity, Malaria Consortium, tailors its operational processes to local migration patterns and demographic challenges by adjusting implementation guides, synchronizing intervention cycles, and engaging with mobile populations. These measures exemplify how adjusting interventions to local conditions can lead to better coverage and potentially higher cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity adapts its operational procedures by utilizing locally established tools and systems for household registration. By leveraging existing resources, Malaria Consortium exemplifies an approach that adjusts interventions to fit the specific characteristics of different locations, which is critical for achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity selects locations for intervention based on specific local characteristics (such as malaria burden, timing of transmission seasons, and existing staff presence), which reflects an operational process that tailors interventions to local contexts in order to ensure cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the charity's use of established local infrastructure and partnerships as part of its operational process, ensuring that interventions are adapted to the specific characteristics and needs of different locations, thereby supporting cost-effective implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity uses location-specific epidemiological and environmental data to determine where its intervention will be most effective. By assessing factors such as malaria burden, transmission seasonality, and rainfall patterns, Malaria Consortium tailors its deployment of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention to areas that meet specific criteria, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages, in order to check for these issues.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process adjustment where training materials are adapted to local linguistic contexts. Translating the job aid into local languages ensures that community distributors understand and correctly implement SMC protocols, which is essential for the intervention to be effective and cost-efficient in diverse settings.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention information collection effort where the charity gathered feedback and data to refine a key tool (the SMC card) used to measure coverage. This process of pretesting helped shape the operational procedures, potentially improving cost-effectiveness by ensuring that the interventionâ€™s monitoring tool was well-designed and reliable before full-scale rollout.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the organization collected and utilized pre-intervention information by researching and adapting existing household registration tools. By pre-testing and tailoring these tools, the charity enhanced its operational processes, which likely contributed to more efficient resource use and overall cost-effectiveness during program implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly outlines a pre-intervention activity where Malaria Consortium collected detailed information about the funding landscape for LLIN campaigns. This data collection process is critical to identifying funding gaps and establishing priorities, which supports the research question by showing how early information gathering contributes to the operational processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly ties the pre-intervention scoping work to the identification of cost-effective funding opportunities. It highlights that collecting information before implementing interventions can directly influence which funding gaps are prioritized, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charityâ€™s operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates that Malaria Consortium undertook pre-intervention information collection by assessing critical epidemiological factors. Such an assessment allows the charity to strategically target areas where malaria is highly seasonal and burdensome, thereby optimizing resource allocation and intervention design. This targeted approach is a key operational process that contributes to the cost effectiveness of their programs.
