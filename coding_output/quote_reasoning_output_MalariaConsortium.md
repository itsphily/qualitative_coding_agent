## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium: In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how Malaria Consortium adjusts its operational processes based on local conditions by choosing local partners (CBOs and district health facilities in Uganda) over international organizations, suggesting a calibration of intervention to align with local context and possibly improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium: We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects the organization’s commitment to adapting and refining its operational processes through close evaluation and local partnerships. While it does not explicitly mention location-specific calibration for cost effectiveness, the emphasis on partnering with local actors implies an adjustment to local conditions which can enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

- **Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

* Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
* Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
* Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
* Rapid post-cycle surveys, which are implemented in the first and third treatment cycles as a quality assurance measure immediately post-cycle to identify missed households. This was also used as an additional data point to triangulate and validate the findings from coverage surveys that are conducted at the end of the transmission season.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details how Malaria Consortium adjusted its operational processes based on location-specific challenges—such as migration patterns and mobile populations—by modifying implementation guides, synchronizing delivery phases, and mapping local migrant routes. These adjustments demonstrate the charity’s practice of calibrating its interventions to local conditions, which can contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium tailors its operational processes by integrating locally existing systems (in this case, household registers) into its intervention. Adapting to local, pre-existing structures helps streamline operations and can contribute to cost effectiveness through resource optimization.

- **Quote:** in areas where Malaria Consortium has existing operations and would be well-positioned to implement LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote from the abstract indicates that the charity specifically chooses to explore funding gaps in regions where it already has infrastructure, demonstrating a calibration of intervention based on location-specific operational presence to optimize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly explains how the charity adjusts its operational focus by using local, location-specific details such as malaria burden, timing of transmission seasons, and existing staff presence to target areas that are likely to yield high cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This statement illustrates that the charity leverages its established local networks and operational bases, further calibrating its intervention based on local partnerships and relationships to ensure a cost-effective rollout when funding opportunities arise.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that the charity tailors its intervention by assessing local, location-specific factors (e.g., rainfall patterns, malaria transmission, and seasonal variations) before launching the program. By doing so, it ensures that the intervention is only deployed in areas where it is likely to be effective—an essential step toward achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This evidence illustrates that operational processes, such as determining distributor compensation, are calibrated based on local economic conditions. Adjusting payment rates by country helps align costs with local standards and resources, supporting overall cost-effective implementation.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages, in order to check for these issues.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the charity adapts its training and operational tools to the local context by translating job aids into local languages. Tailoring materials in this way ensures that guidelines are understood and implemented effectively, thereby contributing to both operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests. Once a final version was created, Malaria Consortium used monitoring tools to test the card's efficacy as a means of measuring coverage during its project in Katsina State, Nigeria, which was a smaller-scale intervention in a more controlled environment than its current programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium engaged in pre-intervention testing of its data collection tool (the SMC card) before full implementation. By gathering and using pre-intervention feedback to modify the card design, they refined their operational processes, a step that can lead to more efficient program delivery and potential cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that before launching the intervention, Malaria Consortium conducted pre-testing of their household registration tool and adapted it using established tools. This pre-intervention data collection and evaluation informed the operational processes, ensuring that the registration and tracking system was streamlined, which is crucial for reducing errors and improving cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly outlines a pre-intervention data collection process, where staff are tasked with gathering information on funding gaps. The collected data is used to suggest funding priorities, linking directly to the way pre-intervention analysis informs operational decision-making aimed at achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that formalizing the pre-intervention data collection process (through a defined scope and timeline) can influence how a charity prioritizes its operational activities. By emphasizing prioritization, the process directly shapes operational decisions that contribute to cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities. Mass LLIN distributions are one of the most cost-effective interventions we've identified for saving lives.
- **Reasoning:** This quote connects the pre-intervention scoping efforts with the identification of interventions that are highly cost-effective, thereby demonstrating how collecting initial data informs strategic operational choices aimed at maximizing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.60
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium collected pre-intervention baseline data to assess key factors (malaria burden, transmission patterns, and seasonality) which informed the targeting and operational decisions of their SMC programs, thereby contributing to cost-effective deployment.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.103
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that pre-intervention data collection extended to assessing drug resistance markers. Such baseline studies help inform operational decisions regarding drug selection and dosing protocols, which are critical for maintaining the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the intervention.
