The use of SMS messaging and cross-border surveillance in Cambodia shows how interventions are customized to the local context, thus optimizing resource use and cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 5.md
- **Quote:** SMC campaigns are implemented under the leadership of national malaria programs and through countries' existing health system structures. Malaria Consortium provides technical and logical support on all SMC intervention components:
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity leverages local, established health systems and national leadership structures to implement its interventions. By integrating efforts within the existing local frameworks, the charity adapts its operational processes to the specific context, which can enhance cost-effectiveness through more efficient resource utilization.

- **Quote:** Planning typically starts around the months before the annual SMC round. This involves determining where and when the campaign will be implemented and estimating the target population, as well as recruiting the required number of community distributors and supervision.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details a location-specific planning process where the timing and geographic targeting are assessed, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately based on local needs and population estimates. Such tailored planning is a key element in adapting operational processes to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** To ensure maximum uptake, mass campaigns such as SMC need to be well accepted by communities. Ensuring communities understand the rationale for SMC and support its implementation is therefore essential. Typically, this includes sensitisation meetings with local leaders, aiming of radio spots, and town announces disseminating relevant information during the campaign.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity customizes its community engagement strategies to fit local contexts by involving local leaders and utilizing local media. Such calibration of the intervention strategy to specific locations can increase uptake and overall efficiency, thereby contributing to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report_2.md
- **Quote:** We have supported Malawi and Kenya to develop their national integrated vector control strategies and insecticide resistance management plans, to guide evidence‐based selection of appropriate interventions that are tailored to local epidemiological settings. We are currently supporting Burkina Faso and Ethiopia to develop their insecticide resistance management plans.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes by tailoring intervention strategies to the specific epidemiological conditions of different locations, which can enhance cost-effectiveness by ensuring that interventions are contextually appropriate.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, we have the privilege of serving 95% of the districts. We are the lead agency on the USAID Malaria Action Program for Districts, and through the DFID-funded 'Strengthening Uganda's Response to Malaria (SURMa) we are working across the country to bring stratified malaria interventions to both community and facility-based services, across both public and private sectors.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt highlights the use of stratified, location-tailored interventions in Uganda, demonstrating how the charity adapts its processes at the country level to align services with local needs, potentially improving cost-effectiveness through targeted delivery.

- **Quote:** In particular, we will: 2. Continue to promote the distribution and use of Long-lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) in appropriate settings, both through campaigns and continuous distribution models, stratified for epidemiological and entomological changes, and where outbreaks occur due to pandemic-induced delays in the delivery of preventive measures.
- **Reasoning:** This planned approach indicates an operational adaptation where intervention delivery (LLIN distribution) is calibrated based on local epidemiological and entomological conditions. Such location-specific calibration is a strategy to enhance cost-effectiveness by deploying resources in a manner that is responsive to local variations.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** Under the HBHI initiative's 'strategic information' response element, the PNLP conducted a stratification exercise with support from WHO, the Institute for Disease Modeling, and Northwestern University to determine the optimal mix of malaria interventions at the health district level. The exercise involved stratifying health districts based on epidemiological characteristics including prevalence, incidence, and all-cause mortality among children under five, and combining the epidemiological information with measures of seasonality, urbanization, and access to care. For SMC, the analysis also modeled the impact of varying the number of cycles depending on seasonality patterns. Based on the recommendations from this exercise, the PNLP decided to adopt five annual cycles of SMC from 2021 onwards in 19 of the country's 70 health districts, primarily in the south.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a location-specific calibration of intervention processes. By using local epidemiological and seasonal data to adjust the number of SMC cycles, the charity tailors its operations to local needs, thereby maximizing resource utilization and enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** During this visit, agreement in principle was reached for:
* the Global Fund to support the procurement of SPAQ and implementation of four SMC cycles in Centrale and Kara
* UNICEF to support the procurement of SPAQ for four SMC cycles and implementation of one SMC cycle in Savanes
* Malaria Consortium to support implementation of three SMC cycles in Savanes
* Malaria Consortium to support planning, training, and M&E in all three regions
* Malaria Consortium to provide technical advice on high-quality implementation of SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates how funding and operational support are allocated based on regional differences. By adapting the number of cycles and support activities according to local circumstances and resource availability, the charity improves efficiency and cost-effectiveness through targeted, region-specific operational strategies.

- **Quote:** However, our procurement teams were able to rationalize procurement assumptions and secure reasonable prices, almost exclusively on national markets. In most cases, the COVID-19 related expenditure was therefore substantially lower than anticipated.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that adapting procurement processes to local market conditions—by leveraging national supply sources—reduces costs. Such operational flexibility in response to local economic conditions enhances overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Digital tools have the potential to improve SMC by increasing coverage, efficiency, quality, transparency, and accountability. … The tool has four workflow components:
• Enumeration: Use of satellite imagery to enumerate residential structures and draw boundaries of operational areas.
• Configuration and planning: Data-collection forms (for example tally sheets, stock reconciliation, supervision tools), creation of teams, and allocation of teams to areas.
• Navigation and delivery: Community distributors can use the map for guidance while in the field and collect data on a handheld device.
• Monitoring and response: Supervisors can see and analyze data in real time.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the adoption of digital, location-specific tools (like the Reveal platform) that enable precise mapping and targeted planning. By tailoring operational processes using spatial intelligence, the charity increases field efficiency and reduces redundant costs, which in turn enhances cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** As Mozambique became affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, and restrictions to travel for group meetings and training were put in place, the Ministry of Health recognized the need to accurately train CAPs remotely on how to prevent transmission of COVID-19 and identify symptoms. They also identified the need update the upSCALE application to enable APKs to differentiate a diagnosis between COVID-19, malaria and pneumonia and regularly update the digital content as new evidence about COVID-19 became available, in addition to providing national COVID-19 surveillance data. As a result of this grant, upSCALE integrated a diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19 and differential diagnosis for malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, delivering COVID-19 disease messaging and awareness materials via the app and SMS tests. The stock management system was updated to include COVID-19 materials such as face masks and gloves and a COVID-19 dashboard for national disease surveillance was developed. In addition to strengthening key relationships within the "Modi", this project also resulted in a peer reviewed publication in PLOS ONE entitled "Community health worker knowledge, statistics and practices towards COVID-19, learning from an online cross-sectional survey using a digital health platform upSCALE in Mozambique."
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity adapts its operational processes in response to local conditions. In Mozambique, by updating its digital platform (upSCALE), integrating a diagnostic algorithm and telemedicine features, the organization tailors its intervention to overcome travel restrictions and meet emerging health challenges, which supports cost-effective service delivery.

- **Quote:** In October 2020, MC-U5 awarded $170,000 to support the integrated community case management (GCM) program in the central region of Uganda to pilot the upSCALE digital platform. The aim is to capture community health worker data in the Bluifree district and its rf-health applications can be used to improve community health worker motivation through internship with the expectation that the quality of malaria care would be improved. This program is ongoing, to date, the development of the upSCALE mobile app has been completed including the diagnostic and treatment modules for malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and COVID-19. All phones and sim cards for the community health workers have been purchased and a local mobile phone provider has been contracted to provide unlimited cellular data. Trainers are currently being trained how to use the mobile software and the phones are being organized and tested for access and security permissions with the national health surveillance system.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates location-specific calibration of intervention strategies in Uganda. By piloting a regionally tailored digital platform, including investments in mobile technology and partnerships with local providers, the charity refines its operational process to enhance both efficiency and the overall cost-effectiveness of its health service delivery.

- **Quote:** Expenditures have been kept to a minimum to maximize the size of our grant awards.
- **Reasoning:** This brief statement highlights the organization's focus on operational cost-containment, ensuring that a larger portion of funds is used directly for interventions. This approach to minimizing overhead is an integral part of enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity org structure.md
- **Quote:** With 95 percent of our staff working in malaria endemic areas, we currently have programmes and projects in 12 countries across Africa and Southeast Asia. Our local insight, embedded technical expertise and practical skills give us the agility to respond to critical challenges quickly and effectively.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity leverages local expertise and embeds staff in regions with high malaria burden, which facilitates rapid, location-specific adaptations in their operations. This reflects on how they calibrate their intervention strategies based on the local context to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Our unique structure and robust approach to tackling malaria and other diseases enable us to deliver among the most cost-effective public health programmes, even in complex and challenging environments.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the aspect of cost-effectiveness, indicating that the charity's operational structure and approach are designed to function efficiently in diverse and complex settings, thereby aligning with the research question regarding the adaptation of operational processes to specific local conditions.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-23 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Nigeria has historically been a difficult environment to work in, requiring collaboration with multiple entities (including the federal government, nine state governments, and the LGAs). Malaria Consortium has stronger relationships with some Nigerian states than others. In 2018, it plans to work on developing a performance-based framework for its partnerships with states to ensure enhanced commitment by local authorities towards improved performance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the charity is adapting its operational process by planning a performance-based framework tailored to different states, demonstrating location-specific calibration aimed at enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Even with sufficient funding, scale-up would need to be progressive and geographically realistic. For 2019, it likely makes sense to target the most-populated states and priority disease burden areas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity is making strategic decisions based on local demographic and disease burden data, directly reflecting a location-specific calibration of intervention strategies to potentially improve cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It might be possible to start progressive eastward expansion in 2019, and expand gradually in 2020; Mr. Moroso thinks it's unlikely to be possible to achieve complete geographic coverage before 2021, short of considerable investments to tailor this intervention to insecure areas.
- **Reasoning:** This passage further emphasizes the need to tailor interventions based on regional characteristics (such as security conditions), indicating that adapting operational processes to local realities is key to enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-18 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium may be able to use drugs that are already available in the country for its SMC program work this year. This would allow Malaria Consortium to focus solely on program implementation and avoid the time-intensive drug procurement process. Malaria Consortium has asked its in-country team to catalog stock-outs from last year to determine if there are sufficient drugs available. Alternatively, Malaria Consortium will plan for ad-hoc procurement for these potential additional districts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a location-specific operational adaptation in Burkina Faso where the charity leverages locally available drugs, thereby streamlining processes and potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness by avoiding the delays and expenses associated with drug procurement.

- **Quote:** There are not enough drugs in Nigeria, so additional drug procurement will be needed for SMC work in this country. Malaria Consortium has regular correspondence with Guilin Pharmaceutical (Guilin) to stay updated on Guilin's order backlog. Approximately 1.6 million treatments will need to be ordered, in case additional drugs are needed in Burkina Faso as well as Nigeria. Guilin is able to produce about 6 million treatments per month for all of its clients. Malaria Consortium estimates that if the order is placed soon, the drugs will be ready to be shipped by late April or early May.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity’s operational strategy is tailored by location; in Nigeria, due to insufficient local drug supply, they must adjust their intervention strategy by engaging in additional procurement, reflecting how they calibrate processes to local conditions which can have implications for overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** ACCESS-SMC on-the-ground program staff have observed differences in the quality of health information recalled by community members in different countries. This is likely due to cultural differences in retaining health-related information. Recall of health data tends to be higher in Burkina Faso, where parents are incentivized to register the birthdates of their children in order to enroll them in primary school. In areas where school enrollment laws are less binding - e.g., Chad - there is less accurate data on the exact age of children, and it is more difficult to ascertain treatment details months after an SMC treatment. Malaria Consortium believes that administering coverage surveys within a week after each treatment cycle should provide more accurate estimates of drug coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the charity recognizes and reacts to location-specific cultural and operational differences by modifying the timing of coverage surveys, an adaptation aimed at improving data accuracy and ultimately informing cost-effective interventions.

### Doc Name: 2017-08-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In Mali, the procedure for SMC delivery is slightly different. Teams that deliver SMC also have RDTs, artemisinin drugs, antibiotics, oral rehydration solution, and other basic medicines so that they can treat children who are unwell. They are able to test and treat for malaria and provide other basic treatments on the spot without the need for referral. The disadvantage of this approach has been that the teams set up a fixed-site mini-clinic in the neighborhood, so people have to come to them. This resulted in lower and less equitable coverage of SMC than the door-to-door campaigns, but this is being addressed now by adopting a complementary door-to-door approach in hard-to-reach areas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a location-specific adaptation in Mali where the intervention was recalibrated from a fixed-site mini-clinic approach, which resulted in lower coverage, to a complementary door-to-door approach in hard-to-reach areas. Such an operational adjustment, based on local challenges, illustrates how charities tailor their processes to improve outreach and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In most countries, villages were selected using probability proportional to size sampling with approximately 50 clusters representing the entire area where ACCESS-SMC was operating. The exception is Niger, in which the researchers performed separate surveys in four representative regions, because the country is too large for them to conduct surveys everywhere.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights another instance of location-specific calibration wherein the operational process is adapted to the geographic scale of the intervention. By splitting the surveys into four regions in Niger due to its large size, the charity adjusts its methodology to maximize efficient resource use, a strategy that can enhance overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2018-03-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium's approach to increasing IPTp coverage rates is dependent on the country and area that it is working in. It conducts holistic needs assessments to determine why coverage is low and develops interventions to address the underlying causes.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates that the charity tailors its operational processes based on location-specific factors, adapting its intervention strategies to local conditions. Such targeted calibration is key to enhancing cost-effectiveness by ensuring that interventions address the unique challenges of each area.

- **Quote:** For example, in Uganda, after a training for health workers on the revised WHO recommendations for IPTp, Malaria Consortium sent text messages to health workers reminding them of material covered during the training. It found that after six months, health workers that received training and text message reminders were more knowledgeable about WHO recommendations for IPTp. It also found that IPTp coverage had increased in the district where it implemented the behavior change intervention. The intervention was inexpensive to implement and was well-received by the Ugandan Ministry of Health, which would like to scale up the program across the nation.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides concrete evidence of a specific, location-adapted intervention process that improved operational efficiency and IPTp coverage in Uganda. The emphasis on low cost and scalability illustrates how adapting processes to local contexts can enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Northern Nigeria and Burkina Faso would be promising locations for this type of pilot study--baseline IPTp uptake coverage would likely be low and government interest in participating in this type of program would likely be high. Uganda and Guinea-Bissau might also be suitable locations for similar reasons. In Northern Nigeria and Burkina Faso, IPTp could be delivered by the same community health workers that are already delivering seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) drugs for children under 5 years old.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the charity’s strategy of selecting intervention sites based on local needs and existing service structures. By leveraging current community health worker networks and targeting areas with low baseline coverage, the charity adapts its operational processes to improve cost-effectiveness through localized calibration of its intervention strategies.

### Doc Name: 2020-02-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The Church of Uganda and PACE use these lists to create logistical plans for implementing the PDMs. They need to have the information about the number and locations of HSDs and villages selected so that they can figure out how many days they will need to have data collectors in the field for that PDM and how many field data supervisors they will need.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how operational planning is closely tied to location-specific data. By determining the number and geographic distribution of HSDs and villages, the charity calibrates its resource allocation (e.g., scheduling data collectors and supervisors) which is a key aspect of enhancing cost-effectiveness through tailored intervention strategies.

- **Quote:** The data collectors in urban settings tend to use the spares more often than those in rural areas, since households in urban areas are more likely to have rented their homes and thus to have moved between net distribution and the PDM.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the adaptation of operational processes based on local contextual differences (urban vs. rural). Recognizing these location-specific patterns allows the charity to adjust its procedures, potentially reducing inefficiencies and contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using the household registration database from the 2017-2018 universal coverage campaign, AMF generates the lists of selected locations for each round of the PDM.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how historical, location-specific data is leveraged to calibrate the current intervention strategy. The use of detailed local information to generate targeted lists supports a process that can minimize redundant efforts and optimize resource use, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2019-02-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In order to build a robust dataset on the implementation and cost-effectiveness of automated diagnostic devices, Malaria Consortium would also like to conduct field assessments of the devices at various health system levels in six countries--all of which have relatively high pneumonia prevalence.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the organization is conducting field assessments across different countries, highlighting a strategy to tailor their operational processes to varying local contexts. This aligns with the research question by showing how location-specific evaluation contributes to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to implementation, Malaria Consortium would analyze existing infrastructure in the six selected countries to better understand capacity for scale-up of automated diagnostic devices.
- **Reasoning:** This passage indicates that the charity adapts its operations by analyzing local infrastructure before implementation. Such location-specific calibration is used to inform how the intervention is rolled out, thereby supporting cost-effectiveness through targeted operational adaptation.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium would pilot automated diagnostic devices in specific regions of the six selected countries, implementing at different levels of health systems (community, facility, private).
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly details a location-specific approach, where pilots are implemented across various regions and at multiple levels of the health system. This operational process adaptation is a clear example of how charities can enhance cost-effectiveness by calibrating their intervention strategies to the local context.

### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes by partnering with local entities and government bodies in specific locations (e.g., Uganda), thereby tailoring their interventions to local contexts—a process that can enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates a systematic approach to monitoring and adapting operational processes based on local feedback, which includes asking context-specific questions about intervention usage. This evidence supports the notion that adaptive, data-driven, and locally calibrated strategies improve intervention cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the organization pilots various solutions based on local factors such as health worker retention, and then scales successful strategies with governmental collaboration. This method of piloting and scaling based on local evidence is indicative of location-specific calibration aimed at enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-19 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium was responsible for implementation in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda, working to introduce injectable artesunate as a first-line treatment for severe malaria, update national treatment guidelines, and establish reliable capacity in doctors and middle- to senior-level health staff responsible for severe malaria management. It focused on care at the referral level, where most individuals with severe malaria are treated, and was largely limited to areas with facilities that had the capacity for severe malaria management.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes by strategically selecting locations with the necessary capacity for severe malaria management. By focusing on these areas, the charity is effectively calibrating its intervention strategies to local conditions, which can enhance cost‐effectiveness by ensuring resources are used where they can have the most impact.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium would likely focus on rural areas where the long distance to regional hospitals creates the greatest access challenges. Malaria Consortium estimates that roughly 30%-40% of Nigeria and roughly 50-60% of Niger and Chad consist of rural areas like this that it would consider eligible for such a program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides clear evidence of location-specific calibration in the charity's operational strategy. By identifying rural areas with significant access challenges, the organization tailors its intervention to address these local issues, which is a key aspect of enhancing cost-effectiveness by directing resources where they are most needed.

### Doc Name: 2020-05-11 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** With additional funding, Malaria Consortium would likely utilize a scoring system to select the most suitable countries to implement IPTi, with criteria including: willingness to adopt policy, scalability, prevalence of SP resistance, health system readiness, and presence of SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates how the charity is planning to adapt its operational processes through a location-specific scoring system that assesses various local contextual factors, which can enhance cost-effectiveness by targeting resources where they are most likely to succeed.

- **Quote:** It also believes revised WHO guidelines would open up possibilities for countries to adapt the intervention to their specific contexts, such as in areas with high SP-resistance rates and sub-national implementation alongside SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the concept of tailoring intervention strategies to local conditions (e.g., high SP-resistance areas), reflecting an approach to calibrate operations based on location-specific factors that can potentially improve cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** * Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes based on the local context—in this case, tailoring the intervention to the needs of mobile populations—which is an example of location-specific calibration that could enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity coordinates its intervention timing across different geographical areas to reduce inefficiencies caused by cross-district movements, thereby adapting its operations in a location-specific manner to improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates a deliberate effort to gather local geographical and demographic data to tailor intervention delivery strategies, reflecting location-specific calibration that helps streamline operations and potentially enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the organization leverages locally established systems to inform and adapt its operational processes, ensuring that the intervention strategy is well-calibrated to the local context, which can lead to improved cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-03-24 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For example, in predominantly Muslim areas where men may not be allowed to enter all houses, female staff of FOMWAN conduct community-based training in the households to demonstrate how to hang the nets properly and provide net cards. Often, members of FOMWAN first visit houses and direct the inhabitants to a distribution point where they can collect their LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes through location-specific calibration by employing culturally appropriate strategies (using female staff in predominantly Muslim areas) to overcome local barriers, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In designing a distribution campaign, it would make sense to focus on the northern part of the country, because this is a generally lower income area; there are fewer problems getting people to use the nets; the malaria burden is high; and there is an outstanding net gap in this area.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates strategic calibration of intervention strategies based on geographic and socioeconomic factors, highlighting a location-specific focus that aims to maximize impact and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium usually aims to distribute nets between December and June to avoid doing this work during the rainy season, since the nets are delivered via large trucks that have trouble traveling to remote areas during this season.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the charity adapts its operational processes by timing distributions to local weather conditions, thus mitigating logistical challenges and contributing to improved cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium selects specific locations for its intervention based on local conditions such as malaria burden and campaign timelines, which reflects an adaptation of operational processes to enhance cost-effectiveness through location-specific calibration.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that the organization leverages established local infrastructures and partnerships to facilitate rapid and effective intervention, further supporting the idea of adapting operational processes based on location-specific factors.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity uses location-specific epidemiological and environmental data (such as rainfall patterns and regional disease incidence) to determine where the intervention will be most effective. By calibrating its strategy to local conditions, the charity enhances cost-effectiveness through targeted deployment.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages, in order to check for these issues.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an adaptation of operational processes to local contexts by translating training materials into local languages. Tailoring communication tools to local linguistic and cultural environments helps ensure accurate and effective delivery of the intervention, thereby contributing to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO): The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria. SMC is recommended for deployment in areas: where more than 60% of the annual incidence of malaria occurs within 4 months; where there are measures of disease burden consistent with a high burden of malaria in children (incidence >= 10 cases of malaria among every 100 children during the transmission season); where SP and AQ retain their antimalarial efficacy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that intervention strategies are designed based on local environmental and epidemiological factors, demonstrating location-specific calibration. Although provided as WHO guidelines, it reflects the broader approach charities use to determine where and how to deploy interventions, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have included an adjustment in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for differences in coverage between the RCTs and Malaria Consortium's program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that the charity adapts its analytical models to reflect the true operational context (i.e., differences in program coverage) compared to trial conditions. This adjustment is an example of calibrating intervention strategies based on location-specific operational realities to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In order to apply the findings from Cisse et al. 2016 to Malaria Consortium programs, we adjust for major differences between Cisse et al. 2016's intervention and context versus Malaria Consortium's.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the charity deliberately recalibrates evidence from external studies to fit their own program context. By adjusting for differences in intervention setup and local conditions, they tailor their operational process to optimize impact and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We also considered using sub-national (rather than country-level) estimates of malaria prevalence to improve the precision of our cost-effectiveness analysis. We decided not to incorporate these adjustments into our model, because we believed the effect on the bottom line was insufficient to justify the additional complexity.
- **Reasoning:** This passage reflects the process of evaluating more granular, location-specific data (sub-national estimates) to potentially refine operational strategies and cost-effectiveness calculations. Even though the adjustment was ultimately not implemented, it demonstrates the charity's consideration of local variability as part of its calibration process.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 5.md
- **Quote:** Planning typically starts around the months before the annual SMC round. This involves determining where and when the campaign will be implemented and estimating the target population, as well as recruiting the required number of community distributors and supervision.
- **Reasoning:** This quote is from the pre-intervention phase and illustrates how essential planning activities—such as estimating the target population and determining campaign logistics—are conducted before the SMC round begins. These activities represent a form of data collection that informs operational decisions, contributing to the program’s cost effectiveness by ensuring appropriate resource allocation and targeted intervention.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** Macro-planning typically begins around five months before the start of the annual SMC round. This involves agreeing campaign dates and modalities at the national and state levels, as well as discussing adaptations to the SMC intervention tools and guidelines. Micro-planning is conducted several months before the start of the SMC round, including budgeting based on detailed enumeration of the target population at the subnational level, required personnel, and commodities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that before the intervention, detailed data is collected (through enumeration and coordinated planning) to inform critical operational processes such as budgeting, personnel allocation, and supply chain management—all of which are key to achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Complete an SMC plan four months prior to each SMC campaign detailing the enumeration of targeted children, human resource capacity needs (including training and supervision), quantification of commodities, and expected operational costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quality standard underscores the importance of pre-intervention data collection and planning. By outlining targeted enumeration and resource quantification well in advance, the charity ensures that its operational processes are based on accurate data, leading to more cost-effective and efficient deployment of resources.

- **Quote:** Under the HBHI initiative's 'strategic information' response element, the PNLP conducted a stratification exercise with support from WHO, the Institute for Disease Modeling, and Northwestern University to determine the optimal mix of malaria interventions at the health district level. The exercise involved stratifying health districts based on epidemiological characteristics including prevalence, incidence, and all-cause mortality among children under five, and combining the epidemiological information with measures of seasonality, urbanization, and access to care. For SMC, the analysis also modeled the impact of varying the number of cycles depending on seasonality patterns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention data collection, through a detailed stratification exercise, is used to analyze epidemiological and contextual factors. This informs strategic decisions about intervention mix and the number of cycles needed, thereby optimizing resource allocation and enhancing cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-23 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** There is significant uncertainty around estimates of the number of children 3 to 59 months old who are eligible for SMC in each country; Malaria Consortium uses moderately conservative estimates for its planning, based on past implementation and on WHO guidelines for determining SMC eligibility.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pre-intervention data—in this case, estimates of eligible children derived from past implementation and WHO guidelines—is used to inform the charity’s planning processes. By basing operational decisions on these conservative estimates, the organization aims to optimize drug orders and coverage, a key factor in maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** When Malaria Consortium tried to collect information on funding gaps for SMC on behalf of potential funders for countries other than Malaria Consortium's focus countries, only Guinea-Bissau and Niger reported having gaps, though even in these two cases the information provided was quite vague.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an aspect of pre-intervention data collection where the attempt to gather information on funding gaps resulted in vague data. This directly impacts operational planning because incomplete or imprecise baseline information can hinder the ability of the charity to allocate resources effectively and achieve cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-18 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium has asked its in-country team to catalog stock-outs from last year to determine if there are sufficient drugs available.
- **Reasoning:** This quote is a clear instance of pre-intervention data collection, where historical data (last year's stock-outs) is gathered before launching the intervention. This information is used to decide whether to use available drugs or initiate a new procurement process, thus informing operational decisions that have a direct impact on cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2018-03-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** When implementing an IPTp intervention, Malaria Consortium generally conducts baseline and endline assessments to evaluate its impact on IPTp coverage. Data for these assessments are gathered through different channels, depending on the program's budget:
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that, before launching an intervention, Malaria Consortium collects baseline data. Such pre-intervention data collection provides a benchmark of IPTp coverage and helps in tailoring operational decisions—key to ensuring that interventions are implemented cost effectively.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium's approach to increasing IPTp coverage rates is dependent on the country and area that it is working in. It conducts holistic needs assessments to determine why coverage is low and develops interventions to address the underlying causes.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that Malaria Consortium undertakes a needs assessment before intervening. By collecting pre-intervention qualitative data on why coverage is low, the organization is able to design targeted operational processes, which is vital for efficient and cost-effective resource allocation.

- **Quote:** The pilot would last 18 months and would include baseline and endline surveys to measure IPTp coverage and antenatal care clinic attendance. Northern Nigeria and Burkina Faso would be promising locations for this type of pilot study--baseline IPTp uptake coverage would likely be low and government interest in participating in this type of program would likely be high.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows the explicit planning for pre-intervention data collection through baseline surveys in a pilot program. The use of such data to identify areas with low initial uptake informs the operational strategy, helping to target interventions where they are most needed and thereby promoting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2019-02-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Prior to implementation, Malaria Consortium would analyze existing infrastructure in the six selected countries to better understand capacity for scale-up of automated diagnostic devices.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that before launching an intervention, the organization collects baseline data (in this case, analysis of existing infrastructure) which informs operational decisions regarding the scalability of diagnostic devices—a key factor in driving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to implementation, Malaria Consortium would build cost-benefit analyses for its intervention based on previous models.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that pre-intervention financial analysis is conducted to forecast potential benefits and cost savings. Such pre-intervention data collection informs the operational planning process, ensuring that the intervention is designed to be cost effective.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-19 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium monitored outcomes by establishing baselines in health facilities and then monitoring trends in artesunate use and incidence of severe malaria cases.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that Malaria Consortium collected baseline data—data gathered before the full intervention was implemented—which serves to inform their operational processes. By establishing these baselines, the organization gains insight into the existing patterns of artesunate use and severe malaria incidence, allowing them to design, adjust, and monitor their interventions in a way that supports cost–effective resource allocation and training.

### Doc Name: 2020-05-11 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In its initial recommendation, WHO identifies target regions for IPTi using the "annual Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rate" of an area, i.e. the rate at which people are bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pre-intervention epidemiological data (the entomological inoculation rate) is used to identify target regions for an intervention, which informs the operational decision-making process aimed at achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** WHO also initially limited its IPTi recommendation to areas where the prevalence of the marker of parasite resistance to the medication is (≤)50%.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights the use of pre-intervention genetic data on parasite resistance as a criterion for implementing the intervention, ensuring that resources are allocated to areas where the intervention is likely to be efficacious and cost effective.

- **Quote:** Many countries do not have sufficient data to assess their regions on these metrics and have not implemented IPTi as a result.
- **Reasoning:** This quote points out that the absence of pre-intervention data can hinder the implementation of an intervention, demonstrating the critical role pre-intervention data collection plays in informing operational processes and safeguarding cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** With additional funding, Malaria Consortium would likely utilize a scoring system to select the most suitable countries to implement IPTi, with criteria including: willingness to adopt policy, scalability, prevalence of SP resistance, health system readiness, and presence of SMC.
- **Reasoning:** Although not explicitly labeled as pre-intervention data collection, this quote implies that a systematic approach, likely based on data collected before implementation, is used to select countries for intervention, thereby informing operational processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection activity where the charity tested and refined its data collection tool (the SMC card) before full implementation. This process of gathering pre-intervention feedback helps inform and fine-tune operational processes, which can contribute to overall cost-effectiveness by ensuring reliable data tracking and reducing inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights another pre-intervention measure where the organization piloted its household registration tool. By pre-testing and streamlining this tool, Malaria Consortium was able to refine its data collection methods, thereby informing operational processes that can lead to more efficient and cost-effective program implementation.

### Doc Name: 2017-03-24 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In order to inform a recent application for funding from the Global Fund, the Nigerian government conducted an analysis of the quantity of nets and other commodities required in the country, broken down by state and by year through 2022. This analysis found that the total country requirement between now and 2020 is about 206 million nets. Of these 206 million nets, about 159 million have been committed, leaving a gap of about 47 million nets that will be needed to maintain universal coverage through 2020.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection activity conducted to quantify net needs before any distribution takes place. The analysis, done prior to intervention, informs funding applications and helps plan the scale of distribution campaigns, thereby indirectly contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2017-04-25 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The data available so far suggest there was very little resistance to the drugs used for SMC at baseline, i.e., prior to Malaria Consortium's intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly indicates that baseline (pre-intervention) data was collected on drug resistance. While the text does not directly connect this finding to specific operational processes that enhance cost-effectiveness, it implies that understanding baseline conditions—such as low drug resistance—can inform decision making regarding the selection and use of drugs, which is a critical element in planning effective and cost-efficient interventions.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection effort where staff gathered information on funding gaps for LLIN campaigns. Such early data collection informs operational decision-making by identifying where additional resources are needed, thereby supporting cost-effective planning for the charitable intervention.

- **Quote:** We believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that establishing clear parameters and timelines as part of the pre-intervention phase can influence a charity’s operational priorities. By doing so, it helps ensure that limited resources are allocated efficiently, thus enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity undertook pre-intervention data collection by assessing epidemiological and environmental factors before launching its SMC programs. Such an assessment informs the operational processes by ensuring that interventions are targeted to areas with a high seasonal burden of malaria, which is critical for maximizing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention data collection was used to establish a baseline measure of drug resistance. By understanding the initial prevalence of resistance markers, Malaria Consortium could make informed operational decisions regarding the use of SP and AQ, thereby safeguarding the effectiveness and cost efficiency of the intervention.

## Code: Using pilot projects: Using trial projects when the charity enters a new location.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 6.md
- **Quote:** We have introduced several innovative pilots, such as community health worker SMS messaging in Cambodia for case identification and mapping and cross-border surveillance of migrant workers to help track and treat those elusive last infections.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that the charity uses pilot projects to trial innovative operational approaches—illustrated by the example of SMS messaging pilots in Cambodia—to refine surveillance and monitoring processes. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the use of such pilots as trial initiatives implies that they are testing methods to streamline operations, which can contribute to overall cost effective strategies when scaling or entering new locations.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 5.md
- **Quote:** Starting with early implementation pilot in Nigeria in 2013, we then led the rapid scale-up of SMC through the Achieving Catalytic Expansion of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in the Sahet (ACCESS-SMC) project in 2015-2017, reaching close to seven million children in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Italy, Niger, Nigeria and theambia.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium used a pilot project as a trial initiative when entering a new location (Nigeria). Although the text does not explicitly detail how the pilot directly contributed to operational processes, the use of a pilot project implies that they tested and refined their operational procedures prior to rapid scale-up, supporting a model that can be cost effective.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report_2.md
- **Quote:** Further expand our reach on seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) across the Sahel, and research/test launch implementation in newly eligible geographies for SMC outside the Sahel.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly references a planned trial initiative—essentially a pilot project—aimed at testing the feasibility of SMC in new locations. Using a test launch approach illustrates how pilot projects are incorporated as part of the charity’s operational process to assess and refine intervention strategies, which can contribute to cost-effectiveness by mitigating risks before large-scale rollout.

- **Quote:** In Mozambique, we have expanded a programme of technology-facilitated support to, and supervision of, community health workers for child and maternal health from the pilot area in Inhambane into Cabo Delgado and Zambezia having been adopted as the national solution, providing community-level, case data directly into the national health management information system.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that a pilot project (the initiative starting in Inhambane) was used as a testing ground for technology-facilitated support. The successful expansion of this pilot into additional regions indicates how trial initiatives can inform operational decisions and scaling strategies, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness through refined and validated processes.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** Starting with an early implementation pilot in Nigeria in 2013-2014, we then led the rapid scale-up of SMC through the Achieving Catalytic Expansion of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in the Sahel (ACCESS‑SMC) project in 2015-2017, reaching close to seven million children in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and The Gambia.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how a pilot project was used as a trial initiative in a new setting (Nigeria) to test and refine the SMC delivery model. The successful use of the pilot informed a rapid, scalable approach and robust operational processes, which in turn minimized risks and contributed to cost-effectiveness by ensuring efficient resource allocation and process optimization.

- **Quote:** The national malaria program (Programa Nacional de Controlo da Malaria, PNCM) approached Malaria Consortium about the possibility of piloting SMC in Mozambique in early 2020. As SP resistance is presumed to be widespread in Mozambique and SMC's effectiveness in this context needs to be demonstrated before scale-up can be recommended, the SMC pilot is designed as a two-year research study, with the first year focusing on exploring the feasibility and acceptability of SMC outside of the Sahel and the second year focusing on demonstrating impact.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt shows that when entering a new location—Mozambique in this case—pilot projects are employed to evaluate local feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. By running a trial before full-scale implementation, operational processes (such as supply management, training, and community engagement) can be adapted to the local context, thereby reducing the risk of costly missteps and enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** In October 2020, MC-U5 awarded $170,000 to support the integrated community case management (GCM) program in the central region of Uganda to pilot the upSCALE digital platform. The aim is to capture community health worker data in the Bluifree district and its rf-health applications can be used to improve community health worker motivation through internship with the expectation that the quality of malaria care would be improved. This program is ongoing, to date, the development of the upSCALE mobile app has been completed including the diagnostic and treatment modules for malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and COVID-19. All phones and sim cards for the community health workers have been purchased and a local mobile phone provider has been contracted to provide unlimited cellular data. Trainers are currently being trained how to use the mobile software and the phones are being organized and tested for access and security permissions with the national health surveillance system. The next step will be to train the community health workers and test the program. If the program is found to be feasible, effectively improving community health data capture and community health worker motivation and service delivery, it is expected the MoH will scale it up across the country. This will depend on available funding with continued donor support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by illustrating how a pilot project in a new location—a trial initiative to implement the upSCALE digital platform in Uganda—allows the charity to test and refine operational processes (such as equipment procurement, training, and system integration) in a controlled environment. Such iterative testing minimizes risk and ensures that only feasible, effective interventions are scaled up, contributing to cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2018-03-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium has proposed a pilot study to GiveWell for a community-based IPTp program. In the pilot program, SP drugs would be delivered door-to-door by community health workers to women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy and could be combined with an existing community platform such as integrated community case management (iCCM). Community health workers would also encourage pregnant women to regularly visit an antenatal care clinic for additional services as well as provide intensive behavior change communication (BCC) health education on use of insecticide-treated nets, good nutrition during pregnancy, the importance of antenatal care, and recognition of danger signs during pregnancy. The pilot would last 18 months and would include baseline and endline surveys to measure IPTp coverage and antenatal care clinic attendance. The 18-month pilot could be followed with a 24-month scale-up period. Northern Nigeria and Burkina Faso would be promising locations for this type of pilot study--baseline IPTp uptake coverage would likely be low and government interest in participating in this type of program would likely be high. Uganda and Guinea-Bissau might also be suitable locations for similar reasons.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a pilot study proposed by Malaria Consortium as a trial initiative when entering new locations. It describes not only the operational process—using door-to-door delivery combined with existing community platforms and baseline/endline assessments—but also how selecting promising locations based on low initial uptake and government interest can help in refining the intervention before scaling up. Such a pilot informs operational effectiveness and cost efficiency by testing the modality in controlled conditions before wider implementation.

- **Reasoning:** This excerpt directly references the use of pilot projects as trial initiatives when entering new locations. By testing the devices across various operational levels, the charity can assess implementation challenges and performance, which feeds into cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses and ultimately supports cost effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes the process of piloting various solutions as a trial initiative. While it does not directly mention 'entering new locations,' the approach of testing interventions before scaling them up with government support reflects an operational process that can lead to cost-effective implementation. By piloting solutions to evaluate what works, the organization can refine its operational strategy, avoid costly mistakes, and efficiently allocate resources.

### Doc Name: 2020-05-11 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Another IPTi pilot programme, funded by Unitaid and being implemented by PSI, is getting started; however, waiting for results until the end of the Unitaid-funded programming could be a missed opportunity for countries that could have spent the intervening years scaling up their IPTi programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pilot projects are initiated as trial initiatives, suggesting that early evidence from these pilots can accelerate the scaling up process in new locations—thereby streamlining operational processes to achieve cost-effective implementation.

- **Quote:** Promoting government adoption: Malaria Consortium believes that further increasing the scale of implementation and the number of countries involved in pilot programs would increase the likelihood of widespread adoption of the intervention and establishment of national policies for IPTi delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This statement directly ties pilot projects to the operational process of fostering government adoption and policy formation, which is critical for cost-effective scaling of interventions when entering new locations.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium has received funding from BMGF to do a 4-year pilot study in one state in Ebonyi State in Nigeria. The primary outcome is to provide evidence for IPTi policy adoption in Nigeria.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pilot projects are used to collect evidence for policy adoption in new locations, serving as a trial initiative that informs and refines operational strategies to ensure cost-effective programs.

### Doc Name: 2017-04-25 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** As a test, ACCESS-SMC digitized the records of 1.4 million children in Mali at a cost of $70,000. This found a good match between the routine data (from the registers) and the results of the coverage survey. The specific context in Mali (fixed points at a health facility) probably ensured better quality of documentation, but even so, a lot of the information was not useful or was improperly recorded.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pilot project undertaken as a trial initiative—in this case, the digitization of records in Mali. It shows how testing a new operational process in a new location can inform whether such approaches can improve administrative data quality and potentially enhance cost effectiveness, which relates directly to the research question.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** **Pilot and scale-up of SMC in northern Nigeria:** The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) provided about $1.7 million to Malaria Consortium to do operational research on the best way to deliver SMC at scale in Katsina state in northern Nigeria, and then to implement its chosen delivery system and assess its efficiency and impact. Malaria Consortium told us that it trained over 3,600 CDs and nearly 200 health workers to provide about 1.6 million courses of SMC to roughly 350,000 children who lived in 4 "local government areas" (LGAs) in northern Nigeria in 2012-2014. A major goal of the project was to share what it learned; we have seen a published paper that describes the use of research to inform the design of an SMC intervention in northern Nigeria but have not yet reviewed it in detail.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium used a pilot project as a trial initiative when entering a new location (northern Nigeria) to conduct operational research, train staff, and test delivery systems. The lessons learned from this pilot project helped inform subsequent scale-up decisions, thereby optimizing operational processes and contributing to cost-effectiveness by reducing implementation risks and improving efficiency.

## Code: Enhancing capabilities of local stakeholders: Improving the ability of local partners to conduct the intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 7.md
- **Quote:** Community-based primary healthcare (CBPHC) involves using community health workers, who may or may not be paid, to deliver health services to under-served communities in remote areas. Community health workers are provided with training, tools and medicines to provide basic healthcare, and are taught what the danger signs are to refer a patient.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process that enhances the capabilities of local partners (community health workers) by providing them with training, tools, and medicines, which is relevant to the research question's focus on how such processes contribute to cost-effectiveness by enabling local delivery of interventions.

- **Quote:** Quality research at the community level helps to measure effectiveness and ensure the sustainability, cost-effectiveness and quality of community-based health interventions. Our inSCALE project, for example, evaluated a range of interventions to improve the retention, motivation and performance of community health workers.

- **Quote:** In 2018, it plans to work on developing a performance-based framework for its partnerships with states to ensure enhanced commitment by local authorities towards improved performance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process—namely, the development of a performance-based framework—to strengthen the capacity and commitment of local state authorities (local partners) in executing interventions. Although the case study does not explicitly link this process to cost-effectiveness, enhanced local partner capabilities are generally associated with improved efficiency and accountability, which can contribute to more cost-effective charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-18 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** * Burkina Faso - Malaria Consortium may be able to use drugs that are already available in the country for its SMC program work this year. This would allow Malaria Consortium to focus solely on program implementation and avoid the time-intensive drug procurement process. Malaria Consortium has asked its in-country team to catalog stock-outs from last year to determine if there are sufficient drugs available. Alternatively, Malaria Consortium will plan for ad-hoc procurement for these potential additional districts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages the capabilities of a local partner (the in-country team) to assess drug availability. By using local insights to determine whether available drugs can be used, Malaria Consortium can avoid a lengthy and costly procurement process, thereby contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of its programs.

### Doc Name: 2018-03-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For example, in Uganda, after a training for health workers on the revised WHO recommendations for IPTp, Malaria Consortium sent text messages to health workers reminding them of material covered during the training. It found that after six months, health workers that received training and text message reminders were more knowledgeable about WHO recommendations for IPTp. It also found that IPTp coverage had increased in the district where it implemented the behavior change intervention. The intervention was inexpensive to implement and was well-received by the Ugandan Ministry of Health, which would like to scale up the program across the nation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how an operational process—inexpensive text message reminders following training—enhances the capabilities of local health workers to deliver interventions, leading to improved coverage and suggesting higher cost-effectiveness for the charity's approach.

- **Quote:** CHWs in Mozambique, known locally as agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs), receive intensive 4-month training and are often high-school educated. Although APEs do not deliver IPTp, they promote ANC visits and the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. Malaria Consortium has worked extensively with APEs to improve trainings and to implement a mobile-phone-based system of tracking pregnant women and referring them to ANC clinics.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the operational process of capacity building for local partners through intensive training and technology-driven interventions (mobile-phone tracking), which is designed to enhance the effectiveness and potentially the cost-efficiency of their health interventions.

### Doc Name: 2020-02-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The Church of Uganda and PACE are implementing partners for the PDMs. The Church of Uganda is implementing PDMs in the western part of Uganda, and PACE implements PDMs in the eastern part. The primary responsibility of these partners is managing the training of field data supervisors and the cascading of that training to data collectors. The implementing partners are also responsible for the monitoring and supervision of the individuals involved with data collection. They take advantage of the existing health structure in order to implement the PDMs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details how local partners are empowered by being responsible for both the training and subsequent supervision through existing health structures. Such operational processes, by leveraging local expertise and infrastructure, likely reduce reliance on external resources and thus contribute indirectly to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The implementing partners use a cascading training model to promote a common understanding of the data collection tool and the purpose of the data collection activities. A 'training of trainers' is held for district level health professionals (primarily the malaria focal persons as well as some district health officers). These health professionals then provide training for health assistants (who serve as field data supervisors), and the health assistants later train VHTs (who serve as data collectors). Each field data supervisor oversees 10 data collectors.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an operational process focused on building local capacity through a cascading training model. By training local personnel at multiple levels—from district professionals to village-level data collectors—the approach can enhance local capabilities while reducing operational costs, thereby contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity's intervention.

### Doc Name: 2019-02-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Health workers correctly performed their job approximately 75% of the time (significantly above Malaria Consortium's expectations).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that through field testing and training—key operational processes—local health workers (acting as local partners) enhanced their performance. Improved local execution of interventions is a mechanism by which cost-effectiveness may be achieved.

- **Quote:** The device assisted health workers in communicating results of diagnoses to caregivers, which could have resulted in less caregiver demand for antibiotics after being presented with a negative diagnosis (no quantitative data on this hypothesis exists).
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how the introduction of an operational tool (an automated diagnostic device) improves local partners’ ability to deliver clear outcomes. Enhanced communication and decision-making can reduce unnecessary expenses (e.g., overuse of antibiotics), thereby contributing to the intervention's cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Benefits may include:
* Reduced financial burden on health systems
* Improvement of and increase in care-seeking behavior
* Reduced cost per intervention
* Faster consultations at both the community and health center level
* Rational use of antibiotics
- **Reasoning:** This list of anticipated benefits links the anticipated outcomes of well-implemented operational processes to improved cost-effectiveness. It implies that by bolstering local partners’ capabilities through targeted interventions (like deploying improved diagnostic technologies), overall system costs can be reduced.

### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where Malaria Consortium deliberately engages local partners, such as community-based organizations and government health facilities. By enhancing local capacity and ensuring local ownership, the approach implies a mechanism for improved efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness in delivering interventions.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores the importance of transferring knowledge and fostering local ownership through partnerships with government and local actors. While it doesn’t explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, the focus on rigorous evaluation and the sustainable handover of capabilities suggests that such operational processes can lower long‐term costs by building efficient, locally driven solutions.

- **Quote:** ICCM (integrated community case management) is our program working with health workers across 4 countries, and it's funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). If a young child with a fever comes to volunteer health workers providing malaria services in the community, the presumption has been that the child has malaria. However, the two diseases which are also highly prevalent in many countries are diarrhea and pneumonia, and they have fever as the primary symptom. It can be hard to know which disease they have, and timing for treatment is critical. The process in many cases is to assume malaria and treat for malaria; only if that doesn't work do health workers start looking at other potential causes. ICCM focuses on building the training and capacity of those frontline health workers to determine which of the 3 diseases the child has. We train and equip them with a fairly simple kit that includes rapid diagnostic tests which require a simple drop of blood to test them for severe malaria and gives results in 15 minutes. If that proves negative, there are respiratory timers to check the breathing speed to test for pneumonia, and ideally the community health workers are equipped with some antibiotics to treat pneumonia. If it isn't either of those, then the presumption is that it's diarrhea; in those cases, they'd have zinc/ORS to treat the symptoms and then refer onward to a health facility. This is a really important life-saving process at the community level. Most of the countries we work in have a policy in place for increasing outreach through community health workers. Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This extensive description of the ICCM operational process highlights how Malaria Consortium builds sustainable capacity among local frontline health workers. By focusing on training, equipping, and piloting retention solutions, the process is designed not only to improve service delivery but also to potentially enhance cost-effectiveness through more efficient, locally managed interventions.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-19 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** When the World Health Organization (WHO)'s guidelines changed in 2012 to recommend injectable artesunate for severe malaria treatment, Malaria Consortium worked to increase the supply of artesunate (which was inadequate in many places) and build the capacity of health workers to administer it.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a key operational process—capacity building among local health workers—to ensure that a more complex, costlier treatment (injectable artesunate) is properly administered. Such capacity enhancement is a fundamental step that can contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention by reducing errors and associated costs.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium focused on adapting guidelines, providing training, and supporting quality assurance measures to ensure commodities reached their end points in good condition.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the operational processes of guideline adaptation, training, and quality assurance. By ensuring that local partners have the correct procedures and skills, the charity is likely to minimize wastage and improve intervention outcomes, which are critical factors for enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium was responsible for implementation in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Uganda, working to introduce injectable artesunate as a first-line treatment for severe malaria, update national treatment guidelines, and establish reliable capacity in doctors and middle- to senior-level health staff responsible for severe malaria management.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium leverages operational processes—such as updating treatment protocols and building local clinical capacity—to ensure effective intervention delivery. Although the quote does not directly mention cost-effectiveness, establishing reliable local capacity is essential for maintaining high-quality care and resource efficiency, both of which underpin cost-effective charity work.

- **Quote:** Artesunate is (1) more expensive than quinine and (2) more difficult to prepare and administer, and so requires intensive practical training and supervision.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores a challenge that necessitates robust operational processes (intensive training and supervision) to manage a costlier and more complex treatment. The implication is that by investing in these capacity-building measures, charities can mitigate higher inherent costs, thereby contributing indirectly to overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** CHWs conducting door-to-door delivery typically work in clusters of pairs supervised by a health worker. In each pair, one person is responsible for eligibility assessment, educating caregivers about how to administer the next two tablets, and giving messages about malaria prevention and when to seek medical care, and the other is responsible for preparing the drugs and completing data forms.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process where local community health workers (CHWs) are organized into specialized pairs, enhancing their capability to deliver the intervention efficiently. Although it does not mention cost-effectiveness explicitly, such structured task division can lead to more efficient use of resources, thus likely contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity’s programs.

- **Quote:** Supervisors monitor a subset of CHWs during each cycle to ensure that they are asking all of the questions on the list and correctly following procedures for determining eligibility, drug administration, and, if needed, referral. The supervisors use the SMC competency checklist while observing the CHWs to ensure that their performance meets quality standards.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a rigorous supervisory and quality assurance process that builds the capacity of local partners to implement interventions accurately. By ensuring adherence to protocols using competency checklists, the process minimizes errors and resource wastage, which is a critical factor in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In order to determine the extent to which this reported decline in cycle-to-cycle coverage was accurate, Malaria Consortium began including a rapid mini-survey at the end of the first and third cycles of the intervention. These surveys are intended as a quality assurance process to explain discrepancies in the data by determining, for example, the effects of recall or loss of the SMC card on the reduction in reported coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that uses rapid mini-surveys as a quality assurance tool to validate and refine intervention data. Strengthening data accuracy through such processes likely improves intervention management and resource allocation, indirectly supporting the cost-effectiveness of the charity’s efforts.

### Doc Name: 2017-03-24 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also works with several local organizations in Nigeria, including the Health Reform Foundation of Nigeria (HERFON), the Federation of Muslim Women's Associations in Nigeria (FOMWAN), and the Christian Health Association of Nigeria (CHAN), on LLIN campaigns as well as other work.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the organization’s deliberate choice to partner with local entities. By collaborating with established local organizations, Malaria Consortium enhances the capacity of partners to conduct interventions, a process that can reduce overhead, leverage local knowledge, and ultimately contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the charity’s efforts.

- **Quote:** For example, in predominantly Muslim areas where men may not be allowed to enter all houses, female staff of FOMWAN conduct community-based training in the households to demonstrate how to hang the nets properly and provide net cards. Often, members of FOMWAN first visit houses and direct the inhabitants to a distribution point where they can collect their LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides concrete evidence of an operational process that utilizes local partner capacity in culturally sensitive ways. By using local staff to conduct training and facilitate distribution, the charity not only ensures more effective intervention but does so in a manner that is likely to be more cost-effective by reducing logistical barriers and increasing community engagement.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium led other partners in supporting the National Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP) to establish several previously funded positions in a state support team, which oversees LLIN distribution campaigns across the country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium works collaboratively with local government programs to build operational capacity. The establishment of a state support team through partnerships enhances local capabilities to execute large-scale interventions, an approach that can lead to more efficient and cost-effective distribution models.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly highlights an operational process where pre-existing local office setups and relationships with local health authorities enhance the organization’s capacity to rapidly implement interventions. Such locally embedded processes can improve the cost-effectiveness of the intervention by facilitating efficient and tailored implementation, thereby addressing the research question.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium supports training of health facility workers and community distributors (CDs) to deliver SMC primarily by going door-to-door.12 Malaria Consortium told us that many CDs are community health workers (CHWs), who are people in the community who work year-round to support basic delivery of health interventions such as vaccines; malaria diagnosis, referral and treatment; nutrition programs, etc. Some CDs are recruited and trained to only deliver SMC and do not provide any other community health services.13
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how Malaria Consortium enhances the capabilities of local partners by training and utilizing community-based health workers. By building local capacity to deliver SMC, the organization leverages local human resources to efficiently implement the intervention, which contributes to a lower cost per child reached and thus improves overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights the cost advantage of relying on local partners who are compensated modestly. Utilizing local community distributors not only ensures culturally appropriate delivery but also minimizes expenses, reinforcing the cost-effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

- **Quote:** Community engagement is an important component of SMC campaigns to ensure high acceptability of the intervention among beneficiaries, as well as to encourage adherence to the three-day SPAQ regimen by caregivers. Activities include sensitization meetings with local leaders, airing of radio spots, and town announcers disseminating relevant information during the campaign.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process—engaging local leaders and using community channels—to secure stakeholder buy-in. By ensuring that local communities are well informed and supportive of the intervention, the process increases both adherence and uptake. In turn, such broad community acceptance contributes indirectly to cost-effectiveness by achieving high coverage at lower per‐child delivery costs.

- **Quote:** I am very proud to be part of the SMC program. I have had a lot of training on how to manage children who are referred to the clinic with fever by the house-to-house SMC teams. [...] The meeting that Malaria Consortium held with community and religion leaders was a wise decision. Religious leaders use mosque sermons to inform people of the benefits of SMC and the same is done by community leaders. As soon as the town announcer starts making announcements, the men continuously ask when their locations will be visited, so as to ensure their wires are at home and their children can be given SMC drugs. [...] Since the children started taking SMC drugs in this community, episodes of malaria have reduced. SMC has also helped other health interventions, like acceptance of immunization for children.
- **Reasoning:** This interview excerpt shows how deliberately involving local community and religious leaders secures essential local stakeholder buy-in. The enhanced communication and support lead to better uptake of the intervention (evidenced by reduced malaria episodes and improved uptake of immunizations), which suggests that the operational process not only ensures community support but also enhances the program’s efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness.

This process helps in establishing sustainability and potentially reducing the need for ongoing external support, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** ICCM focuses on building the training and capacity of those frontline health workers to determine which of the 3 diseases the child has. We train and equip them with a fairly simple kit that includes rapid diagnostic tests which require a simple drop of blood to test them for severe malaria and gives results in 15 minutes. If that proves negative, there are respiratory timers to check the breathing speed to test for pneumonia, and ideally the community health workers are equipped with some antibiotics to treat pneumonia. If it isn't either of those, then the presumption is that it's diarrhea; in those cases, they'd have zinc/ORS to treat the symptoms and then refer onward to a health facility. This is a really important life-saving process at the community level. Most of the countries we work in have a policy in place for increasing outreach through community health workers. Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This extensive account details the operational process of training local frontline health workers through the ICCM program. By equipping local personnel with the necessary diagnostic tools and knowledge, the program fosters local capacity and potentially reduces costs associated with external specialists.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-18 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Coverage surveys - ACCESS-SMC on-the-ground program staff have observed differences in the quality of health information recalled by community members in different countries. This is likely due to cultural differences in retaining health-related information. Recall of health data tends to be higher in Burkina Faso, where parents are incentivized to register the birthdates of their children in order to enroll them in primary school. In areas where school enrollment laws are less binding - e.g., Chad - there is less accurate data on the exact age of children, and it is more difficult to ascertain treatment details months after an SMC treatment. Malaria Consortium believes that administering coverage surveys within a week after each treatment cycle should provide more accurate estimates of drug coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an example of real-time monitoring during the implementation phase—using coverage surveys immediately after treatment cycles—to gather accurate data on drug coverage. This timely feedback mechanism is an operational process that can be leveraged to adjust program implementation, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are deployed efficiently.

- **Quote:** Examining blister packs - Malaria Consortium has used this method and found it to be effective in some areas of Nigeria and Burkina Faso. It was less effective in Chad, despite information on blister pack retention being provided to caregivers. In Chad, retention of any medical records, including immunization cards, is also an issue, due to illiteracy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights another monitoring technique used during implementation—to verify proper treatment administration and coverage. By identifying where this method is less effective, the organization can adapt its operational processes, which is a critical step in managing resources and improving the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2017-08-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** LSHTM sends a report to each country with key indicators after each coverage survey has been completed.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium is coordinating the PDM. It has the following responsibilities: monitoring and supervising the implementation of the PDMs by the Church of Uganda and the Programme for Accessible Health Communication and Education (PACE) managing data entry coordinating household revisits writing quarterly progress narratives and financial reports for AMF (the most recent of which were submitted in December 2019)
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly highlights that monitoring and supervision are integral responsibilities within the charity’s operational processes. It shows that continuous oversight during the implementation phase is embedded in their workflow, which is essential for maintaining efficiency and, implicitly, cost effectiveness through structured performance and accountability mechanisms.

- **Quote:** The implementing partners (the Church of Uganda and PACE) manage supervision teams that monitor the data collection activities. Field data supervisors conduct spot checks of household visits and also review a sample of the VHTs' data collection tool forms to see if data is properly entered in the various fields and to look for inconsistencies. They use various spot check or monitoring tools.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates the active monitoring of data collection processes, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. By detecting inconsistencies and errors early, the charity reduces the likelihood of costly mistakes or rework, thereby enhancing the operational cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** After a data entrant finishes entering data for their 250 households, 13 households (5%) are randomly selected by a different data entrant to be reentered by that data entrant. The data entry supervisor can then compare the data entered by the first and second data entrants for these 13 households, identify mismatches, and compare against the original data collection tool to correct mistakes. A report is generated that shows the rate of mismatched data for the re-entered households--both in total and for individual data entrants.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt describes a quality assurance monitoring process during data entry. By employing re-entry checks and error tracking, the charity optimizes data quality, which minimizes wasteful expenditures and improves operational efficiency—key components in achieving overall cost effectiveness during implementation.

### Doc Name: 2019-02-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In order to build a robust dataset on the implementation and cost-effectiveness of automated diagnostic devices, Malaria Consortium would also like to conduct field assessments of the devices at various health system levels in six countries--all of which have relatively high pneumonia prevalence.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium intends to actively monitor its intervention through systematic field assessments during implementation. The resulting data collection is aimed at informing cost-effectiveness models, thereby integrating monitoring into operational processes that optimize efficiency and cost savings.

- **Quote:** After implementation, Malaria Consortium would utilize results from its process evaluation to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses of different diagnostic devices at different levels of health systems and in different settings.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the monitoring and evaluation (via process evaluation) provide critical feedback. The data derived from ongoing monitoring is used to perform cost-effectiveness analyses, which in turn guide operational adjustments and scale-up strategies to improve overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by demonstrating how monitoring and evaluation during implementation informs operational processes. The emphasis on analyzing and refining processes to establish best practices illustrates how such monitoring can lead to cost-effective improvements in intervention delivery.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a concrete example of monitoring during implementation, where tracking operational metrics (such as health worker attrition) leads to piloting and scaling effective solutions. This process is integral to refining operational strategies, which in turn contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-19 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium monitored outcomes by establishing baselines in health facilities and then monitoring trends in artesunate use and incidence of severe malaria cases.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a specific monitoring procedure during intervention implementation. By tracking baseline data and trends in drug use and case incidence, the organization can make operational adjustments that potentially enhance cost effectiveness through improved resource allocation and targeted support.

- **Quote:** There is also room to improve monitoring of health worker capacity and compliance with guidelines (e.g., whether artesunate is administered correctly, whether patients receive follow-up artemisinin-based combination therapies once they can tolerate oral medication, etc.).
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an identified gap in the monitoring process, focusing on health worker performance and adherence to guidelines. Effective monitoring in this area could lead to better operational decision-making, ensuring that resources are used appropriately and thereby contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** CHWs use a job aid that includes a sequence of questions and drawings to ask the household caregiver. Supervisors monitor a subset of CHWs during each cycle to ensure that they are asking all of the questions on the list and correctly following procedures for determining eligibility, drug administration, and, if needed, referral. The supervisors use the SMC competency checklist while observing the CHWs to ensure that their performance meets quality standards. The checklist is also used by the supervisors to give CHWs performance improvement feedback and to complete their _Supervisor End-of-Cycle Report_.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the monitoring mechanisms in place during the intervention, including direct observation, use of job aids, and competency checklists. It demonstrates how ongoing monitoring feeds back into operational processes (e.g., performance feedback and retraining) that can ultimately support cost effectiveness by ensuring efficient and standardized delivery of services.

- **Quote:** In order to determine the extent to which this reported decline in cycle-to-cycle coverage was accurate, Malaria Consortium began including a rapid mini-survey at the end of the first and third cycles of the intervention. These surveys are intended as a quality assurance process to explain discrepancies in the data by determining, for example, the effects of recall or loss of the SMC card on the reduction in reported coverage. Malaria Consortium also used these surveys to determine whether participants took all three days of treatments in each cycle and used this information to revise its approach and its supervision process to address treatment gaps that were identified.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how monitoring through rapid mini-surveys informs adjustments to operational processes by identifying data discrepancies and treatment gaps. The feedback obtained is used to revise approaches and supervision protocols, which helps optimize resource allocation and improve overall intervention efficiency, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-03-24 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Technical oversight, including training staff on tasks such as monitoring & evaluation and distribution of commodities; logistics; and demand creation, which includes messaging before, during, and after a distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that monitoring & evaluation are an integral part of Malaria Consortium’s technical oversight during the intervention. By incorporating monitoring into the operational processes (with activities occurring before, during, and after distributions), it is implied that such checks can help streamline processes and improve efficiency, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In a GiveWell-funded distribution, Malaria Consortium would plan to conduct a net retention survey, which it typically does 4-6 months after the distribution. These surveys are useful because they give information on coverage levels and reasons why people are or are not using the nets. This information has been useful for designing demand creation programs to ensure that people use the nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that monitoring (in the form of net retention surveys) is used to gather critical feedback on the intervention. The data obtained informs adjustments in operational strategies, such as demand creation programs, which is a process that contributes to operational cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-04-25 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** This year the program will observe how closely administrative data and coverage surveys agree with each other. If they are close, it may be best not to continue with coverage surveys. If there are substantial differences, it will consider other options. One possibility is to rely primarily on routine data but occasionally carry out "gold standard" surveys in representative areas to confirm accuracy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how ongoing monitoring during the intervention—the comparison between administrative data and coverage surveys—can directly inform operational decisions. By potentially reducing the frequency of expensive surveys when data aligns, the program leverages monitoring to enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** As a test, ACCESS-SMC digitized the records of 1.4 million children in Mali at a cost of $70,000. This found a good match between the routine data (from the registers) and the results of the coverage survey.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a specific monitoring intervention (digitization of records) that evaluates the reliability of routine data. By validating that routine data accurately reflects survey results, the program can potentially avoid redundant data collection efforts, thereby contributing to more cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** The program decided to replace registers with grids in the back of the SMC tally sheets, which will capture unique numeric identifiers as pre-printed in SMC child cards. The front of the sheet contains the usual information (such as how many doses a child has received), and the back contains this grid in which the child's unique seven-figure code can be written. It is only entered when drug administration is confirmed; for instance, if the child vomits, a second dose is given, and only then the code is entered. This ensures the child will appear in the records regardless of where they received treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational improvement adopted during implementation as a direct response to monitoring challenges. The revised tally sheets ensure greater accuracy in record keeping, which enhances the reliability of data used in operational decision-making and supports cost-effective management of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** Monitoring and evaluation, including direct observation of program activities by Malaria Consortium staff, funding and coordinating with research firms and academic institutions to conduct coverage surveys and to track changes in malaria incidence and death, and monitoring of drug resistance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the active monitoring processes during implementation. It shows that Malaria Consortium systematically tracks program activities, such as direct observation and coverage surveys, which feed into analyses that determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, illustrating how monitoring contributes to operational performance.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium conducts coverage surveys to determine what proportion of the target population (children aged 3-59 months) was reached with SMC in the previous round or cycle. We use results from past SMC rounds to understand the impact we should expect future rounds to have. Specifically, we use coverage survey results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the cost of delivering SMC to a child.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links monitoring (through coverage surveys) to the estimation of program cost per child. By using real-time implementation data as an input to their cost-effectiveness model, the charity ensures that ongoing operational processes are aligned with efficient use of resources.

- **Quote:** SMC campaigns are implemented under the leadership of national malaria programs and through countries' existing health system structures.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights that the intervention leverages established local health systems and national programs, effectively imposing an operational requirement on local stakeholders. By utilizing pre‐existing infrastructure, the programme can reduce duplication of efforts and lower operational costs, thereby contributing to its cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Planning typically starts around the months before the annual SMC round. This involves determining where and when the campaign will be implemented and estimating the target population, as well as recruiting the required number of community distributors and supervision.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a pre-intervention operational process that mandates local stakeholder involvement, particularly through the recruitment of community distributors and supervisors. Such structured planning and local recruitment likely enhances logistical efficiency and minimizes wastage, which in turn supports the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** SMC is typically delivered dose-to-door by volunteer community individuals, it is safe and cost-effective intervention that can be delivered safely at scale [21] in clinical trials, it has been found to prevent up to 75 percent of malaria cases in children under life.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores that the delivery of the intervention relies on volunteer community individuals—local stakeholders who are required to participate in the door-to-door distribution. Their involvement reduces labor costs and contributes directly to the overall cost effectiveness of the programme.

- **Quote:** SMC implementers are typically trained through a cascade model starting at the national level about one month before the SMC round, with each order of trainers subsequently training the next lower level of trainers and learners. All community distributors and supervisors attend a one- or two-day classroom training before the start of the campaign.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process where local stakeholders undergo a cascade training model. Imposing such training requirements ensures that local personnel are well-prepared to execute the intervention efficiently, leading to optimized use of local resources and enhanced cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2020 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** Micro-planning is conducted several months before the start of the SMC round, including budgeting based on detailed enumeration of the target population at the subnational level, required personnel, and commodities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that mandates local stakeholders to provide accurate local data and engage in detailed budgeting. By requiring precise enumeration and planning at the local level, the intervention minimizes over-ordering or wastage and ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, which is a key contributor to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SMC implementers are typically trained through a cascade model beginning at the national level about two months before the start of the annual SMC round, with each cadre of trainers subsequently training the next lower level of trainers and learners. SMC training typically includes modules on identifying eligible children, referring sick children to a health facility, administering SPAQ safely, recording SPAQ administration, interpersonal communication, and safeguarding.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines the rigorous training requirements imposed on local stakeholders. By ensuring that all local actors—from the national level to community distributors—are thoroughly trained, the intervention enhances adherence to protocols and reduces implementation errors, thereby increasing efficiency and contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** Administrative monitoring data -- including on households visited, SPAQ administered to eligible children, and children referred to health facilities -- are collected by community distributors on tally sheets, which are compiled by health workers at the end of each cycle and reported upwards to the district or LGA, and provincial and central health authorities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational requirement for rigorous data collection and reporting by local stakeholders. By systematically tracking service delivery and outcomes at the local level, the intervention can identify inefficiencies, ensure accountability, and make necessary adjustments, all of which help to control costs and enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Report.md
- **Quote:** A grant of 5150,000 was awarded to South Sudan to help meet required co-financing for delivering the Boma Health Initiative (BHI). Launched by Government of the Republic of South Sudan, the BHI is a standardized package of community health services delivered to improve access to essential health services, strengthen linkages between communities and primary health facilities, and increase community ownership and governance of health services to improve the reach of health services in communities is national. The integrated package includes health promotion, disease prevention and selected treatment packages delivered by community health workers to help bridge the gap between health facilities and communities. To fully fund this country-wide initiative, a pooled health fund of approach. This grant enabled the successful roll out of the BHI for approximately 1.2 million children in three counties of Warrap State (Coggial East, Western and Twic) and two counties of Upper Nile state (Nasir and Ulany) supporting the following activities in South Sudan:
* Funded costs (43 percent) to run health facilities in April State.
* Coordination of sensitization meetings for 537 county community leaders on the BHI approach.
* Recruitment and training of 570 BHI community health workers on management of child health in the community which included malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, malnutrition and immunization.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process in which the charity’s intervention in South Sudan includes a required co-financing component. By mandating local stakeholders (e.g., government and community partners) to contribute financially, the intervention leverages additional local investment, fosters accountability, and shares the cost burden—all of which are mechanisms that can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-23 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In 2018, it plans to work on developing a performance-based framework for its partnerships with states to ensure enhanced commitment by local authorities towards improved performance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders—in this case, state governments—by establishing a performance-based framework. Although the case study does not explicitly link this process to cost effectiveness, the implication is that by ensuring higher local accountability and improved performance, the intervention can become more efficient, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-18 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium may be able to use drugs that are already available in the country for its SMC program work this year. This would allow Malaria Consortium to focus solely on program implementation and avoid the time-intensive drug procurement process. Malaria Consortium has asked its in-country team to catalog stock-outs from last year to determine if there are sufficient drugs available.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where the charity requires its in-country team, a group of local stakeholders, to conduct a systematic review of last year’s drug stock-outs. By doing so, Malaria Consortium can determine whether available local resources can be leveraged, potentially allowing them to sidestep a lengthy procurement process. This operational requirement thus could contribute to reduced intervention costs and improved cost effectiveness, directly relating to the research question.

### Doc Name: 2018-03-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For example, in Uganda, after a training for health workers on the revised WHO recommendations for IPTp, Malaria Consortium sent text messages to health workers reminding them of material covered during the training. It found that after six months, health workers that received training and text message reminders were more knowledgeable about WHO recommendations for IPTp. It also found that IPTp coverage had increased in the district where it implemented the behavior change intervention. The intervention was inexpensive to implement and was well-received by the Ugandan Ministry of Health, which would like to scale up the program across the nation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where health workers, as local stakeholders, are required to adhere to training protocols reinforced by text message reminders. The process is linked to improved knowledge and increased IPTp coverage at low cost, thereby suggesting that such requirements contribute to the intervention's cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** To address this issue, it added a recordkeeping component to health worker trainings, which Malaria Consortium believes was partially responsible for increased IPTp coverage rates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the addition of a recordkeeping requirement for health workers—a local stakeholder—which appears to have improved IPTp coverage rates. This operational process implies that imposing structured responsibilities can enhance program outcomes in a cost-effective manner.

### Doc Name: 2020-02-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Then, before moving on to collect data from a spare household, they must visit a local leader to obtain a letter confirming the reason that they have offered. For instance, the local leader may confirm that the household has moved and is no longer living in the village.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that imposes a requirement on a local stakeholder (the local leader) to verify a justification (the household’s absence) before engaging spare households. Such a requirement enhances accountability and data integrity, which can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing errors and potential fraud.

- **Quote:** The implementing partners use a cascading training model to promote a common understanding of the data collection tool and the purpose of the data collection activities. A 'training of trainers' is held for district level health professionals (primarily the malaria focal persons as well as some district health officers). These health professionals then provide training for health assistants (who serve as field data supervisors), and the health assistants later train VHTs (who serve as data collectors).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process requiring local stakeholders to participate in a structured training cascade. By leveraging local capacity for training, the intervention minimizes reliance on external resources and reduces training costs, thereby potentially improving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-01-19 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Artesunate is (1) more expensive than quinine and (2) more difficult to prepare and administer, and so requires intensive practical training and supervision. Artesunate comes as a powder that needs to be reconstituted with 5% sodium bicarbonate for two minutes and then diluted with normal saline; determining the proper amounts of these to use requires special training, repeated practice, and a calculator. The correct amount of saline also depends on the patient's weight, and lower-level health facilities do not always have a scale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the operational requirement imposed on local healthcare providers where they must acquire specialized skills and equipment to properly prepare and administer artesunate. Despite its higher cost, the strict training and supervision processes are intended to mitigate errors, implying that such imposed requirements can enhance cost effectiveness by ensuring the expensive treatment is used correctly.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium focused on adapting guidelines, providing training, and supporting quality assurance measures to ensure commodities reached their end points in good condition.
- **Reasoning:** This passage evidences an operational process wherein local stakeholders are required to adhere to updated guidelines and undergo training. These measures ensure that interventions are implemented correctly, which is crucial for maintaining the cost effectiveness of the program by minimizing waste and ensuring optimal outcomes.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium works to change health worker behavior by educating them about why particular practices are important and providing ongoing mentoring and supervision.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity’s intervention includes enforcing behavioral requirements on local health workers through education and continuous oversight. Although not explicitly linked to cost effectiveness, it can be inferred that such operational processes help maximize the benefits of the intervention, thereby contributing indirectly to its cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** CHWs performing door-to-door drug delivery tend to treat several children in each household. In practice, children from many households in the same compound are usually treated at the same time. If the children are living in a compound, they will line up in a courtyard to receive the first day of SMC drugs and to be observed for the subsequent 30 minutes so that the CHW can verify whether any of the children vomit and need to be given a second dose.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational procedure that requires local stakeholders (both CHWs and the community) to adhere to a structured process for drug administration. By ensuring proper observation and immediate corrective action, the process helps prevent dosing errors and wastage, which can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CHWs conducting door-to-door delivery typically work in clusters of pairs supervised by a health worker. In each pair, one person is responsible for eligibility assessment, educating caregivers about how to administer the next two tablets, and giving messages about malaria prevention and when to seek medical care, and the other is responsible for preparing the drugs and completing data forms.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a division of labor imposed on local stakeholders, ensuring a clear allocation of responsibilities. Such structured roles promote accountability and efficiency in service delivery, factors that can contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** CHWs are instructed to keep a supply of extra drugs for a period of 5 days after the end of the distribution period (which lasts 3-4 days in most countries) and to keep track of who was given an additional dose. After this period, they return the leftover supply of AQ to either their supervisor or the local health facility. A supply chain drug reconciliation form is used to record who received extra doses of AQ.
- **Reasoning:** This operational requirement imposes strict guidelines on drug management and accountability for local stakeholders. By minimizing waste and ensuring precise tracking of drug usage, the process supports efficient resource allocation and contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CHWs use a job aid that includes a sequence of questions and drawings to ask the household caregiver. Supervisors monitor a subset of CHWs during each cycle to ensure that they are asking all of the questions on the list and correctly following procedures for determining eligibility, drug administration, and, if needed, referral. The supervisors use the SMC competency checklist while observing the CHWs to ensure that their performance meets quality standards.
- **Reasoning:** By imposing the use of structured job aids and subjecting CHWs to supervisory checklists, the intervention enforces high operational standards among local stakeholders. This quality assurance mechanism helps reduce errors and inefficiencies, indirectly supporting the cost effectiveness of the program.

### Doc Name: 2017-03-24 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Creating an LLIN coordinating network in each state, which is typically a partnership between the state government, a security agent, NGOs, traditional leaders, and religious leaders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where Malaria Consortium sets up a formal coordinating network that requires the involvement of multiple local stakeholders. Such structuring can improve coordination and leverage local expertise, which may contribute to cost effectiveness even though the text does not explicitly tie this process to cost savings.

- **Quote:** Distributions themselves are conducted by Malaria Consortium, in collaboration with state health officials and local partner organizations. For example, in predominantly Muslim areas where men may not be allowed to enter all houses, female staff of FOMWAN conduct community-based training in the households to demonstrate how to hang the nets properly and provide net cards. Often, members of FOMWAN first visit houses and direct the inhabitants to a distribution point where they can collect their LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of an operational process that imposes specific requirements on local stakeholders (e.g., engaging FOMWAN for community-based training in culturally sensitive contexts). By aligning local stakeholder actions with tailored operational protocols, the intervention is poised to be more effective and cost-efficient, though the text does not explicitly detail the cost-effectiveness outcome.

### Doc Name: 2017-04-25 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The program decided to replace registers with grids in the back of the SMC tally sheets, which will capture unique numeric identifiers as pre-printed in SMC child cards. The front of the sheet contains the usual information (such as how many doses a child has received), and the back contains this grid in which the child's unique seven-figure code can be written. It is only entered when drug administration is confirmed; for instance, if the child vomits, a second dose is given, and only then the code is entered. This ensures the child will appear in the records regardless of where they received treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that imposes a specific data-entry requirement on local health workers. Although the text does not directly address cost effectiveness, ensuring that every child is properly recorded through these imposed procedures can lead to improved data reliability and potentially more efficient use of resources, which are factors that may contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, there have been a number of difficulties: Literacy - Some community health workers have been unable to understand or properly enter the information in the registers, making their accuracy not very reliable.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the challenges in imposing detailed record-keeping requirements on local stakeholders. The difficulties experienced by community health workers due to literacy issues suggest that such operational processes, when not well matched to stakeholder capacity, could undermine data accuracy and thus potentially affect the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** For each cycle, Malaria Consortium instructs CDs to:

1. determine whether the child is eligible for SMC and give the age appropriate dose.18
2. refer all acutely sick children and children with fever to the health facility for evaluation and testing for malaria.19
3. directly observe the child swallowing the first dose of dispersible SP+AQ, and then re-dose if the child vomits or spits out all of the medicine within 30 minutes of taking the first dose of the medication.20
4. give the child's caregiver 2 tablets of AQ and explain how to give the doses over the following two days.21
5. record all doses provided on a tally sheet and mark the wall of the household or compound as visited.22
6. advise the child's caregivers to mark a card to record that they've given the other two doses,23 to give the medication again if the child vomits (and to visit the health facility to request replacement doses if this happens), and to take the child to the health facility if they get a fever or are very sick.24
7. provide health promotion and malaria prevention messages, including explaining the purpose and benefit of SMC and the importance of children and pregnant women sleeping inside a bed net each night.25
- **Reasoning:** This detailed list of operational requirements imposed on community distributors (local stakeholders) illustrates how Malaria Consortium standardizes various critical tasks—such as eligibility determination, direct observation of medicine administration, record-keeping, and follow-up instructions—to ensure high-quality and consistent delivery of the intervention. Such rigor in operational processes helps maximize effective coverage and minimizes wastage, which are key factors contributing to the program’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages,27 in order to check for these issues.28
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the implementation of a standardized operational tool (the checklist) for local staff, ensuring that community distributors adhere to defined procedures. By reducing the likelihood of human error and enhancing consistency in service delivery, this process likely supports improved resource utilization and contributes to the intervention’s cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO): "SMC provides protection for up to 1 month after each complete (3-day) course... Health workers should give the dose of SP and the first dose of AQ to the children under their direct observation and should advise the children's caregivers on how to give the second and third doses of AQ to the child at home."
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process in which local stakeholders—specifically health workers and caregivers—are required to follow strict procedures during the intervention. The direct observation of the initial dose and subsequent caregiver instruction represent imposed requirements that help ensure proper treatment adherence. Such processes can contribute to cost effectiveness by potentially increasing the quality and impact of the intervention relative to its costs, even though the text does not explicitly connect these requirements to cost outcomes.
