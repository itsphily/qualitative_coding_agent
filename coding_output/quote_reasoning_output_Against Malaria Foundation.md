## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: What we do.md
- **Quote:** Monthly malaria case rate data is gathered from all health centres in a distribution zone. This information helps show net impact and determine where additional community-led malaria education activities and net hang-up campaigns are appropriate.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that collects localized data to assess net impact, enabling the charity to tailor further interventions based on local needs. This adaptation implies strategic resource allocation contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** A pre-distribution surey is carried out with visits to all households in a distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and perfectly usable nets already in place. This ensures a household needing three nets will receive three nets, not two or four.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process that adapts the intervention based on local household needs, reducing wastage and ensuring resources are allocated appropriately for cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** AMF discusses with the NNCP and other parties whether there is a need for nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that AMF verifies local net need by engaging with local public health authorities, an adaptive process that can help avoid wasteful spending, thus supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF identifies and approaches organisations, potential distribution partners, that may have the resources and necessary experience in-country to participate in a net distribution. Participation may include carrying out PDCUs, other monitoring activities during the pre-distribution or distribution phase, or taking a significant management, planning or operational role in the distribution itself.
- **Reasoning:** This passage emphasizes the selection of in-country partners based on local expertise, suggesting that leveraging local capabilities can reduce logistical challenges and costs, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** pre-distribution activity in the area to receive nets to establish: a list of beneficiaries, specifically the net need per individual household; full cooperation and involvement of local community leaders and health officers; a plan for the receipt, transport, distribution, malaria-education, delivery to all beneficiaries, hanging and post-distribution follow up of the nets
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of pre-distribution activities illustrates how AMF tailors its intervention to local conditions by collecting and verifying beneficiary data, which helps in efficient resource allocation and contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Allocating donations.md
- **Quote:** The fight against malaria is most effective when net distributions are planned a long time in advance. This allows a detailed understanding to be built up of how long nets will last in the climate and use typical in the region. In an ideal cycle nets would be distributed, monitored, and replacement nets funded as soon as the need becomes evident. A typical cycle will last approximately three years.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that environmental and usage data are factored into planning net distribution cycles, enabling precise timing of interventions and efficient resource use, which can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, there are regions where distributions are desperately needed on a shorter timescale, and AMF acts tactically to cover them. Where this happens we reallocate donations to meet the earlier net need.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity adapts its operations based on region-specific urgency by tactically reallocating donations, thereby ensuring timely distribution and efficient use of resources for cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** When deciding to fund nets for a distribution, we look for two things: areas with a malaria problem where there is also a need for nets, and distribution partners with whom we are comfortable working.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that AMF tailors its intervention by selecting locations based on malaria risk and net need, ensuring that resources are directed to high-need areas and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It is important data is recent and accurate. This helps avoid both over-delivery and under-delivery of nets to households. Over-delivery of nets is wasteful. This can occur if perfectly usable nets are not counted with households receiving four nets when they might only need two. Under-delivery of nets can leave sleeping spaces uncovered and this can compromise breaking transmission.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an operational process that relies on updated local data to ensure precise net delivery, preventing wasteful over-supply and inefficiencies, which supports cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Distribution partners will typically carry out a pre-distribution registration survey (PORS) across the entire distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of LLNs with at least one year of remaining use. If there have been no, or few, nets distributed in the last three years there _may_ be no need to assess existing usable nets. If recent, accurate data based on the number of people per household exists, it may be the data used for a distribution with additional accuracy being sacrificed in order to achieve an immediate distribution and people protected. In such a case, AMF and the distribution partner discuss whether the data is reliable and up-to-date or whether a new PORS should be conducted.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates an adaptive decision-making process where AMF customizes its approach based on local data availability, balancing immediate needs with data accuracy to ensure efficient resource use and cost effective distribution.

### Doc Name: Distribution Partners.md
- **Quote:** AMF works with the National Malaria Control Programme (IMRC) in each country and with specific distribution partners for each distribution who may take full operational responsibility for a distribution or may have specific monitoring and evaluation roles in line with the high levels of data-led accountability
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a process of partnering with local entities that can undertake specific roles, an adaptation that leverages local strengths to improve efficiency and reduce costs, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We first speak with National Malaria Control Programmes and other organisations to establish net need in a country and attitude to accountability, which can then lead to more detailed discussions and identifying in-country distribution partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the process of assessing local net needs and accountability through dialogue with key local stakeholders, an approach that can optimize resource allocation and reduce inefficiencies, thereby supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Don de Savigny 10-22-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's initial model was successful in providing smaller numbers of nets (e.g., ~5,000 to 50,000) to local NGOs to work at the sub-national level in support of national programs. These distributions had relatively high oversight because of implementation by local on-the-ground NGOs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF’s early operational process was tailored to local contexts by using local NGOs, suggesting that high oversight and localized interventions can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF has had success in Malawi, at the 250,000 net level, collecting six-monthly post-distribution net use and check-up information, sampling 5% of households receiving nets. The results are impressive.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of an operational process adapted to local conditions, where regular monitoring and data collection help refine distributions and enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_6-30-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF adapts its verification process based on regional characteristics, which helps in ensuring accurate allocation and contributes to reducing wasteful spending, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Data are being entered at a rate of about one province per month. This is all being done through Rotary International.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how leveraging local partnerships for data entry can minimize overhead and improve efficiency, which directly supports cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md
- **Quote:** The non-AMF nets are generally from national distributions. AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory. AMF also seeks to appeal to community leaders by telling them that if they overestimate, other communities won't get nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an approach where local needs are verified through coordination with national and local authorities, ensuring that nets are allocated to underserved areas, thereby supporting cost effective resource use.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** While AMF intends to respect this deadline, it has also received assurance from the NMCP that the distributions can still proceed if pushed back (for example, due to transportation challenges) to July or August.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates operational flexibility by adapting distribution timelines based on local transportation challenges, ensuring that logistical delays do not lead to rushed, inefficient operations, thus supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The logistics, monitoring, and operational teams of Ghana's NMCP will be on the ground in all 3 districts, liaising with local health systems to manage and supervise distributions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that leveraging local teams and systems helps tailor interventions efficiently, contributing to reduced operational costs and enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In some countries, such as Malawi, AMF distribution partners conduct a two-step, "105%" data collection process. A first wave of data collectors collect registration data from all households in a given area (i.e. 100% data collection). A separate, smaller group of data collectors then visits unannounced 5% of the households which are randomly selected and collects the same registration data.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed data collection method ensures accuracy in household registration, reducing errors and improving resource allocation, thus contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational adaptation that minimizes travel distance, reducing transportation time and costs, which directly contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Because there are no detailed maps or geographical information system data for rural Malawi, HSAs rely on the knowledge of village leaders to locate all households in the village. The presence of the village leader also lends credibility to the HSAs and makes households more likely to cooperate.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational adaptation where local expertise is leveraged to overcome mapping challenges, reducing the need for costly mapping solutions and contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md
- **Quote:** We rarely if ever now work with groups that do not have a permanent or semi-permanent connection with communities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a selective process favoring partners with strong local ties, which helps ensure reliable operations and reduces overhead costs, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, results were better than we expected in areas we thought would face more challenges, such as IDP camps where people live in temporary structures. It may be that even when living in temporary and small structures, many people are organised and take pride in their living space.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores that even in challenging settings, tailored interventions can succeed, suggesting that adapting to local conditions may contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We suggest sensible methods such as visiting different parts of the distribution area, some households from each of a number of villages, and not households in a row, and where possible to use the beneficiary list to randomly select who will be interviewed before going out to do the surveys.
- **Reasoning:** This passage emphasizes an adaptive approach in data collection, ensuring representative sampling and accurate assessments, which are essential for efficient and cost effective planning.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows adaptation of data collection methods by local partners, reflecting an operational process that can enhance cost effectiveness by improving distribution accuracy.

- **Quote:** The three-year program that AMF is currently negotiating with Country A would distribute 2.2 million nets in the first year, 1.8 million in the second year, and 1.5 million in the third year. This schedule will give AMF an opportunity to assist with closing the gap, as well as learn from its experience working with partners in Country A.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an adaptive multiyear distribution schedule that allows for learning and iterative improvement, suggesting that tailored timing can lead to more efficient resource use and cost effective operations.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final-1 2011.md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal has already started its own Ntcheu-wide distribution, funded by the Against Malaria Foundation (for the nets) and by Irish Aid (for distribution costs). The national distribution will be excluding Ntcheu for this reason.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Concern Universal adapts its operational process by running its own distribution separate from the national program, streamlining resources and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern is using a slightly different model for assessing LLIN need. While the national program is aiming for one LLIN provided for every two household members, Concern is counting the sleeping spaces in each household and aiming for one LLIN per sleeping space. Concern stated that its grant from Against Malaria Foundation had been based on this model (the same model it had used in an earlier distribution), so it hadn't wanted to switch to the national-level model.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process that tailors the assessment of need to local household structures, potentially reducing waste and ensuring cost effective allocation of nets.

- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects an operational process in data verification that leverages local oversight to prevent misreporting, thus ensuring efficient and cost effective distribution.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_9-9-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** IMA previously carried out a distribution in Kasai Occidental, DRC, using the 'hang up and track' model. For its distribution in Nord-Ubangi it will be switching to the model used by Concern Universal in its Malawi distributions. This model is expected to be a better fit for Nord-Ubangi for two reasons:
1. IMA had trouble accurately estimating the number of nets needed in Kasai Occidental, possibly because the population data it used and the information reported by community health workers were not as accurate as IMA expected. IMA has done less work in Nord-Ubangi and has a weaker presence there, and it is possible that the problems in Kasai Occidental could be more extreme in Nord-Ubangi.
2. Because of the large distances between villages and the nature of infrastructure in Nord-Ubangi, it is necessary to accurately estimate how many nets are needed in each village when pre-positioning them before distributions, because it is costly to transport them more than necessary. It is likely more cost-effective to gather and run logistics and operations on very detailed and reliable data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a tailored distribution model designed to address local challenges in Nord-Ubangi, linking detailed data gathering to reduced transportation and logistical costs, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The Malaria Unit could potentially bring down costs of standard distributions and provide a strategic opportunity to share, support, and influence operational policies within Malawi's NMCP.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a process where establishing a dedicated unit tailored to local contexts can reduce distribution costs and improve operational efficiency, contributing directly to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 5-23-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** Plans for distributions in Malawi

AMF plans to fund future LLIN distributions (including funding non-net costs) in the three districts in Malawi that it has worked in previously (Ntcheu, Balaka, and Dedza), and one additional district, in partnership with Concern Universal. The next distribution in Ntcheu is due in 2015, in Balaka in 2016 and in Dedza in 2017. In the additional district, population figures suggest a need for 400,000 nets. An agreement has been reached between the NMCP, Concern Universal and AMF for the distribution to take place in late 2014 or early 2015.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how selecting districts based on past experience and local partnerships facilitates efficient distributions, reducing errors and wastage, thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Balaka distribution, October 2013

There was a delay of eight months in AMF's distribution in Balaka District for two reasons First, errors in data collection led to the pilot pre-distribution registration survey (pilot PDRS) having to be re-done and, some of the results of the full PDRS were implausible, so a portion of the PDRS had to be redone. This resulted in a delay of four months. Second, available net production slots across the candidate net manufacturers contributed a further four months delay. CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt highlights an adaptive response to local data challenges, where revisiting surveys helped ensure reliable data, preventing costly errors and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-28-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** As its funding increases, AMF aims to make more strategic investments by engaging in the planning cycles of countries where it has strong connections and experience.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that aligning investments with local planning cycles allows for more efficient and targeted operations, which contributes to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In order to ensure accurate net need estimates, AMF distributions include comprehensive household-level pre-distribution surveys. Without these surveys, estimates might be based on an out-of-date or incomplete population census.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores an operational process where localized surveys provide accurate data for net allocation, reducing waste and improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Net need estimates used to be based on the assumption that most sleeping spaces are shared by 2 people, and so 1 net is needed to cover 2 people. Recognizing that a significant number of people do not share their sleeping space, AMF and others now typically use 1.8 people per net.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational refinement responding to local living arrangements, which helps in better matching net supply to actual need, reducing waste and enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF has hired a consultant to increase its capacity in Ghana. The consultant has a significant amount of experience in Ghana.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects an internal capacity-building process through local expertise, ensuring interventions are tailored to local conditions and efficiently implemented, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** In Guinea, AMF was able to reduce a $14 million funding gap to $8 million by reducing the size of the nets, eliminating unnecessary packaging, and not running distributions in areas where nets were not needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of operational adaptation to local needs that resulted in significant cost savings, directly linking tailored intervention processes to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF has suggested that Kinshasa province might not need a universal coverage distribution, since the capital region of any country tends to have lower malaria rates than the rest of the country. TGF has noted that a number of areas within Kinshasa province, including the peri-urban areas, have very high malaria rates compared to other countries. Ultimately, the coverage in Kinshasa province will be determined by the malaria prevalence data.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates that AMF tailors its intervention based on local epidemiological data, ensuring resources are allocated where needed most, which contributes to lower costs and improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** Once AMF has identified funding gaps, it begins discussions with in-country partners, typically starting with the country's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), to learn about the country's needs, when it is doing distribution, and how it plans to approach distribution (mass distribution, rolling distribution, etc.). AMF then drafts an agreement for the NMCP, which typically includes the specifics of AMF's approach to operations, data collection, and accountability.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how engaging directly with local partners to understand their operational context can lead to more tailored and cost effective interventions.

- **Quote:** AMF aims to ensure that countries it works with have a good operational plan that is properly resourced and scheduled to enable effective delivery. To accomplish that, AMF ideally begins planning for distributions 12 to 24 months out, which gives it more time to set up good distribution practices. AMF considers 18 months the comfortable minimum amount of time in which to plan a net distribution. AMF might deprioritize a country if it needs distribution too soon for a good operational plan to be put together (e.g. six to nine months out), or if AMF fails to receive timely responses from the country because of e.g. bureaucratic slowdowns.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that aligning distribution timelines with local planning capacity allows for more efficient operations, thereby reducing rushed deployments and costs, and supporting overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, AMF requires household registration data that is collected on paper to be converted to electronic form at a data entry center. Previously, AMF had let each country decide how to handle data entry, but found that this resulted in countries using a wide range of different numbers of data entry centers, which sometimes created issues with inconsistent data entry practices, lack of internet access, bureaucratic complexity, etc. AMF learned that it is more effective for it to require that countries use a single data entry center.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that standardizing data entry processes across locations reduces inefficiencies and inconsistencies, leading to improved operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Funding 2021.md
- **Quote:** Areas with a higher incidence of malaria were prioritized and received nets, while areas with lower incidence went uncovered.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that prioritizes high malaria incidence areas for net distribution, thereby focusing resources where they are most needed and enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** After information is collected and verified, Concern Universal creates a distribution planning document which: Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that adapting distribution logistics based on local geography can reduce travel distances and associated costs, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** When deciding where to locate distribution points, the Greater Accra GHS considered safety, costs (for example, the cost of renting a warehouse) and proximity to other distribution points.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that incorporating local economic and infrastructural considerations into distribution planning helps reduce logistical costs, thus enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** IMA believes point distributions rather than at-household distribution will be more cost-effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links a change in the operational process—switching to point distributions—to a benefit in cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** Identify which net types to use based on malaria prevalence, insecticide resistance, and price data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that tailoring net selection based on local epidemiological and economic data can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the intervention, contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Historically, when selecting locations for distributions, AMF consulted various sources, including the Alliance for Malaria Prevention's (AMP's) list of countries with significant net gaps, other malaria control funders, in-country technical advisors, the relevant national malaria control program (NMCP), implementing organizations, and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that using diverse, location-specific data sources to determine distribution locations helps target interventions more effectively, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF appears to exclusively target countries with known malaria risk. Going forward, AMF told us that it plans to direct over two thirds of its funding to DRC, the country with the second highest number of malaria cases in the world, and where malaria is the leading cause of death.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that targeted funding based on local malaria risk ensures resources are concentrated where the impact will be greatest, leading to improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** For the distribution, they have determined that it's important to rely on existing infrastructure such as a Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), government health workers who each cover a few villages. There are 431 HSAs in Ntcheu and 37 health centers. The HSAs are assisting with the pre-distribution survey and the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how leveraging existing local health infrastructure minimizes the need for additional resources, thus contributing to cost effective operations.

- **Quote:** We asked CU why it plans to give out nets at a village meeting after registration, instead of going door-to-door and distributing nets at that time. CU said that the latter approach could cause problems if they didn't estimate enough nets to bring along ahead of time, that it wouldn't allow CU to collect good data on pre-existing net coverage, and that it would hamper transparency (villagers wouldn't have chances to review and make changes to information on how many nets were needed for each household).
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains an operational adaptation aimed at improving data accuracy and oversight, which helps prevent misallocation of nets and enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CU generally wouldn't do a one off project like what they are going to do with the net distribution and are carrying one out this time because of the length of time with which they have worked with Ntcheu District Council and its relevance to their objective of building District capacity on service delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that a long-term relationship with local stakeholders enables tailored interventions and efficient resource use, which are key to achieving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 2011.md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal has already started its own Ntcheu-wide distribution, funded by the Against Malaria Foundation (for the nets) and by Irish Aid (for distribution costs). The national distribution will be excluding Ntcheu for this reason.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Concern Universal adapts its intervention to local funding and distribution realities, thereby improving coordination and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern is using a slightly different model for assessing LLIN need. While the national program is aiming for one LLIN provided for every two household members, Concern is counting the sleeping spaces in each household and aiming for one LLIN per sleeping space. Concern stated that its grant from Against Malaria Foundation had been based on this model (the same model it had used in an earlier distribution), so it hadn't wanted to switch to the national-level model.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process wherein adapting the assessment model to local household configurations results in more accurate net allocation, reducing waste and improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects an operational process that incorporates local verification through community oversight, ensuring that net need is accurately assessed to optimize resource use and cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** A pre-distribution survey is carried out with visits to all households in a distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and perfectly usable nets already in place. This ensures a household needing three nets will receive three nets, not two or four.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates a pre-intervention operational process where baseline data is collected to determine households' net requirements. By ensuring that each household receives exactly the number of nets needed, the charity minimizes wastage and maximizes cost effectiveness through efficient resource allocation.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** This process is a little modified from that followed in prior years due to an initial focus now on discussions with National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) and other organisations to establish net need and attitude to accountability, which precede discussions with in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that AMF begins its operational process by engaging in discussions with NMCPs and other organisations to establish the need for nets. This pre-intervention data collection ensures that resources are directed only where there is a demonstrable need, contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF discusses with the NNCP and other parties whether there is a need for nets.
- **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates that determining the need for nets is a critical operational step before launching an intervention. By verifying need with relevant parties, AMF ensures that interventions are justified and efficient, which is an important factor in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** pre-distribution activity in the area to receive nets to establish: a list of beneficiaries, specifically the net need per individual household; full cooperation and involvement of local community leaders and health officers; a plan for the receipt, transport, distribution, malaria-education, delivery to all beneficiaries, hanging and post-distribution follow up of the nets
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of the pre-distribution phase shows that AMF collects baseline data such as the net need per household and beneficiary lists. This operational process allows for precise planning and allocation of resources, ensuring that the intervention is tailored to actual needs and thus contributes to overall cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** 1. Accurate household-level net need data

What? Number of sleeping spaces and existing usable nets. Why? So we know exactly how many nets each household needs. It is important data is recent and accurate. This helps avoid both over-delivery and under-delivery of nets to households. Over-delivery of nets is wasteful. This can occur if perfectly usable nets are not counted with households receiving four nets when they might only need two. Under-delivery of nets can leave sleeping spaces uncovered and this can compromise breaking transmission.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the operational process of collecting baseline data on household net needs. It underscores how accurate, pre-intervention data prevents both over-delivery (wasteful spending) and under-delivery (insufficient coverage), directly linking such processes to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Distribution partners will typically carry out a pre-distribution registration survey (PORS) across the entire distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of LLNs with at least one year of remaining use.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides explicit evidence of a pre-intervention baseline data collection process through the PORS. By establishing accurate net need data before implementation, the charity can ensure resources are allocated efficiently, thereby contributing to cost-effective interventions.

### Doc Name: Distribution Partners.md
- **Quote:** AMF works with the National Malaria Control Programme (IMRC) in each country and with specific distribution partners for each distribution who may take full operational responsibility for a distribution or may have specific monitoring and evaluation roles in line with the high levels of data-led accountability
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that utilizes data-led accountability measures, suggesting that the charity’s approach includes detailed monitoring and evaluation. Though it does not explicitly mention baseline data collection, the emphasis on data-driven oversight implies that gathering initial information is key to informed decision-making, which can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We first speak with National Malaria Control Programmes and other organisations to establish net need in a country and attitude to accountability, which can then lead to more detailed discussions and identifying in-country distribution partners.
- **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates a pre-intervention process of gathering essential baseline information (such as net need and accountability attitudes) before implementing an intervention. This kind of operational process is instrumental in ensuring that subsequent actions are properly tailored to actual needs, thereby likely enhancing cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Information we publish.md
- **Quote:** A household-level survey is carried out by the distribution partner to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of perfectly usable LIUIs already in place. This net need, per household, forms the basis of the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a pre-intervention operational process where baseline data is collected on household needs (sleeping spaces and LIUIs) which informs the scope of the intervention. By determining the net need accurately beforehand, the charity can allocate resources efficiently, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We collect and publish monthly malaria case rate data to help us assess and monitor the impact of the nets. Data are collected from all health centres in a distribution zone including 12 months of historic information prior to the distribution, to allow comparison.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the collection of baseline data (12 months of historic malaria case rate data) prior to the intervention. It provides context for evaluating the intervention's impact, enabling informed decisions that are essential for maintaining cost effectiveness in charitable operations.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_6-30-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF and other funders are considering an independent audit. This will include an examination of the existing data for signs of fraud, and visits to 20 randomly-selected villages: 10 in the Eastern Region and 10 in the Western Region. In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed passage outlines an operational process where AMF is actively planning to collect and verify baseline data through an independent audit and re-registration of households. Such measures are essential in ensuring that estimates are accurate before further interventions, ultimately contributing to cost effectiveness by helping avoid underestimations and subsequent extra costs.

- **Quote:** The most recent data suggest that the number of nets required is about 30% higher than estimated. Consequently, the government has requested an additional four million nets, which would cost about $15 million (including non-net costs).
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the financial implications of relying on outdated or inaccurate baseline data. It highlights that insufficient pre-intervention data collection can lead to significant cost overruns, thereby demonstrating how robust operational processes for baseline data collection can improve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md
- **Quote:** AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a pre-intervention operational process where baseline information (via the beneficiary list and household sleeping space inventory) is used to target areas with a shortage of nets. Ensuring that the nets reach communities in genuine need is an essential step that can contribute to cost effectiveness by avoiding wasteful or redundant distributions.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Actual net needs ended up being greater than the amounts estimated in the pre-distribution registration survey (PDRS), so AMF had to ship in an additional 100,000 nets in the second week of January 2016.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF conducts a baseline data collection (the PDRS) prior to the intervention to estimate net requirements. Although the estimation was lower than actual needs, it highlights the use of pre-intervention data to inform resource allocation—a key operational process aimed at improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Before the entire data collection process starts, both sets of data collectors are made aware of the 5% checking process and AMF reports that this motivates the first wave of data collectors to do high-quality work.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process in which AMF ensures data quality during the pre-intervention registration phase. By motivating data collectors with a 5% check mechanism, the process enhances the accuracy of baseline data, which is critical for efficient resource planning and ultimately contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducts pre-distribution registration surveys in the four districts in Malawi it carries out net distributions in. These surveys are conducted in cooperation with traditional leaders and local health officials. The purpose of the surveys is to determine how many nets are needed for the upcoming net distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote evidences a pre-intervention operational process, where baseline data is collected to quantify net needs before the intervention begins. Such a method helps ensure that resource allocation closely matches actual community requirements, a factor that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal begins the registration survey process by collecting demographic data from district health offices, including:
* Number of households per district
* Number of households per catchment area
* Number of people per household
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the collection of essential demographic baseline data prior to net distribution. By gathering this information, Concern Universal can plan and allocate nets more efficiently, which is a key operational process that can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The two sets of data are entered into a Microsoft Access database separately. Reconciliation of the data is done after data entry. The data is used to calculate the number of nets required in each village, health center catchment area, and district.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how the collected baseline data is processed and reconciled to accurately determine the net requirements across different areas, thereby ensuring that the intervention is precisely scaled. This careful matching of supply to demand is a crucial aspect of maintaining cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final-1 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly highlights a pre-intervention operational process: collecting baseline data on LLIN needs. By verifying household data before distribution, the process ensures that resources are allocated based on actual need, which is integral to achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Whether there's a shortage will not be known until the data is in regarding needed LLINs vs. usable LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This statement emphasizes that obtaining accurate baseline data (comparing needed versus usable LLINs) is essential to inform supply decisions. Such data-driven decision-making supports efficient resource use, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** GHS volunteers carry out the registration process, which takes place more than one month before the distribution. Volunteers visit each house in their zone. The head of household, or someone else who is present, is asked how many people are in the household based on the "people who eat from the same pot" definition.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a pre-intervention operational process where baseline data is collected to determine household sizes. By gathering this information before distributing nets, the charity can accurately calculate net needs, helping to ensure resources are allocated efficiently and reducing waste, which is key to being cost effective.

- **Quote:** Coupon books are collected at the sub-district's GHS office, where each household's number of nets is calculated by dividing the number of people in the household by two. Odd household numbers are rounded up.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the systematic use of the baseline data collected during registration to compute net allocations. Employing a data-driven calculation process minimizes errors in supply ordering, ensures proper resource matching, and thereby contributes to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In all three regions with AMF-supported distributions, all coupons underwent a pre-distribution validation process by the NMCP and non-profit partners. At the community level, total estimated nets (based on 2010 census data) are compared to the total number of nets allocated during registration.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a pre-intervention quality assurance step where the collected baseline data is cross-checked with external estimates. This validation process enhances the accuracy of the data and prevents costly misallocations, thus indirectly supporting overall cost effectiveness in program implementation.

### Doc Name: NMCP_Ghana_08-16-16_to_08-18-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Insecticide resistance (IR) monitoring - The NMCP has been conducting insecticide resistance research for two years in 20 sentinel sites across the country; two sites in each region. It is building a database to track insecticide susceptibility levels in the control. This will largely guide which vector control tool will be used in the various regions. Seven different insecticides are tested with WHO standard protocol for susceptibility tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process whereby baseline data is collected (i.e. insecticide resistance levels) well before decisions about interventions are made. By building a database that informs which vector control tool to deploy in each region, the NMCP is using pre-intervention data to tailor its approach, a practice that can improve cost‑effectiveness by ensuring that resources are directed toward the most appropriate interventions.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** After a review of overall net needs and through discussions with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (an expert on IR within Uganda and use of PBO nets), the Ugandan Ministry of Health has requested that the majority of the nets be PBO nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a pre-intervention operational process where AMF reviews existing data—net needs and insecticide resistance information—to tailor their intervention (net type selection) before implementation. This kind of baseline assessment helps ensure that resources are directed where most needed, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF continues to review new information on prevalence and IR in order to develop its strategy, which may include delivering next-generation nets.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that AMF incorporates up-to-date baseline data on malaria prevalence and insecticide resistance into its strategic planning before interventions. By basing decisions on current data, the organization can optimize net allocation and potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF is not yet certain what proportion of its net allocation will be PBO nets, as the ratio will depend on IR data, costs, and other uncertainties. _February 2020 update:_ AMF continues to assess this data in advance of each net purchase decision.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects an operational process wherein AMF collects and evaluates key data (including IR data and cost information) prior to making procurement decisions. Such pre-intervention data assessment ensures that the intervention is designed to match local conditions and budgetary constraints, which is a critical element for achieving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_9-9-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** Before approaching a country, AMF reviews existing data and increases its communication with various sources to gain a high degree of confidence that there is a net gap.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where AMF collects and reviews baseline data (existing malaria data and local insights) before initiating interventions. By ensuring there is a true net gap, AMF can target its interventions more precisely, which contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Because of the large distances between villages and the nature of infrastructure in Nord-Ubangi, it is necessary to accurately estimate how many nets are needed in each village when pre-positioning them before distributions, because it is costly to transport them more than necessary. It is likely more cost-effective to gather and run logistics and operations on very detailed and reliable data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links the collection of detailed baseline data (estimating net requirements in villages) with cost-effectiveness. It explains that pre-positioning based on accurate data minimizes unnecessary transportation costs, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing overall expenses.

- **Quote:** AMF now posts pre-distribution registration survey operations plans on its website. This became formalized as part of the effort to increase efficiency during the busy period about 9 months ago. This will be part of the typical documentation for distributions in the future, except in cases where it creates an unnecessary burden.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF has standardized an operational process for pre-intervention data collection through pre-distribution registration survey operations plans. Standardizing such processes helps improve planning, reduce inefficiencies, and supports cost-effective intervention implementation.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 5-23-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** There was a delay of eight months in AMF's distribution in Balaka District for two reasons First, errors in data collection led to the pilot pre-distribution registration survey (pilot PDRS) having to be re-done and, some of the results of the full PDRS were implausible, so a portion of the PDRS had to be redone. This resulted in a delay of four months. Second, available net production slots across the candidate net manufacturers contributed a further four months delay. CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process—the pre-distribution registration survey (a form of baseline data collection)—and illustrates its critical role in planning. The need to redo the survey due to data errors led to significant delays, implying that accurate baseline data is essential for timely and potentially cost-effective intervention implementation by avoiding inefficiencies.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-28-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** In order to ensure accurate net need estimates, AMF distributions include comprehensive household-level pre-distribution surveys. Without these surveys, estimates might be based on an out-of-date or incomplete population census.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process used by AMF before the intervention: the collection of baseline data through pre-distribution surveys. By ensuring accurate net need estimates, these surveys contribute to improved resource allocation and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Net need estimates used to be based on the assumption that most sleeping spaces are shared by 2 people, and so 1 net is needed to cover 2 people. Recognizing that a significant number of people do not share their sleeping space, AMF and others now typically use 1.8 people per net.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects how operational adjustments informed by baseline data (e.g., actual sleeping arrangements) lead to a more precise estimation of net needs. This refinement of assumptions contributes to cost effectiveness by aligning net distributions more closely with real-world conditions.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** Pre-distribution monitoring (preDM) to monitor operational readiness. AMF funds an independent organization to have someone sit in on meetings of the national malaria control program (NMCP) and report to AMF on progress, meetings, plans, resources, and gaps. AMF later funds an independent organization to go into the field and observe the government's registration process. AMF randomly selects villages for the independent organization to visit, and the organization assesses to what extent registration is happening properly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a pre-intervention operational process where baseline data about the registration process is collected. By monitoring operational readiness and the quality of the registration process before interventions, AMF aims to improve planning accuracy and reduce costly errors, directly linking robust data collection to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** As an example, for a 2016-17 distribution in Uganda, AMF initially bought 10 million nets, but ended up needing to buy 2 million additional nets due to inaccurate population estimates. This delayed the distribution significantly and had flow-through effects on the cost of the PBO RCT. If AMF had had more time, it would have been able to ensure that it had accurate population estimates, thus avoiding these problems.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how failure to collect accurate baseline data (in this case, population estimates) resulted in inefficiencies and additional costs. The implication is that thorough pre-intervention data collection contributes to cost-effectiveness by preventing resource wastage and delays.

- **Quote:** Accurate registration and distribution data, in electronic form, is key to both a) funding the right number of nets to ensure universal net coverage (without gaps and without wastage), and b) understanding the success, or otherwise, of a distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This passage emphasizes the importance of having reliable, electronically processed baseline data. Collecting and analyzing accurate registration data before and during an intervention enables AMF to procure the correct number of nets and assess distribution success, which are critical factors in maintaining cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** For example, AMF requires household registration data that is collected on paper to be converted to electronic form at a data entry center. Previously, AMF had let each country decide how to handle data entry, but found that this resulted in countries using a wide range of different numbers of data entry centers, which sometimes created issues with inconsistent data entry practices, lack of internet access, bureaucratic complexity, etc. AMF learned that it is more effective for it to require that countries use a single data entry center.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where standardized data collection (in this case, converting paper-based household registration data into electronic form) is implemented before interventions. This process helps to eliminate inconsistencies and inefficiencies, supporting cost effectiveness by ensuring reliable baseline data and streamlining subsequent operations.

- **Quote:** AMF aims to ensure that countries it works with have a good operational plan that is properly resourced and scheduled to enable effective delivery. To accomplish that, AMF ideally begins planning for distributions 12 to 24 months out, which gives it more time to set up good distribution practices.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the importance of pre-intervention planning. By allocating significant time for operational preparation – which includes collecting and analyzing relevant baseline data – AMF helps ensure that its interventions are well-organized and effectively executed, which in turn contributes to greater cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** United Purpose collects demographic data from the district health office, including the number of households in the region and the number of people per household.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an early, pre-distribution operational process where baseline data is gathered on household numbers. Such data is critical for accurately estimating net requirements, thereby helping to avoid overspending or under-allocation and contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Once in the household the HSA collects information including the name of the head of the household and the number of sleeping spaces.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that detailed baseline data—specifically, the number of sleeping spaces—is collected during household visits. By assessing actual need at the household level, the process ensures precise allocation of nets, reducing waste and inefficiency which are key for cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** After information is collected and verified, Concern Universal creates a distribution planning document which: Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc. Allocates a number of nets to be delivered to each location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines how baseline data is used to inform a detailed distribution plan. By using pre-intervention data to optimize distribution logistics (for example, minimizing travel distance and matching nets to actual need), the process helps control costs and improve overall efficiency.

- **Quote:** In Ghana, volunteers organized by one of AMF's distribution partners, Ghana Health Services (the National Malaria Control Program is a part of Ghana Health Services), collected information on the number of people in each household prior to the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that across different regions, similar pre-distribution data collection processes are employed. Gathering household data prior to intervention allows for targeted planning and resource allocation, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness by ensuring that resources are used efficiently.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** Registration: During the registration process, national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door in targeted areas to collect the information used to determine the number of LLINs to allocate to each household (e.g., the number of sleeping spaces and/or the number of household members), as well as the information used to identify the household for the distribution and post-distribution surveys.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention operational process—in this case, collecting baseline data on household needs—which informs the precise allocation of nets. By gathering detailed data before implementation, AMF can ensure that interventions are more accurately targeted and resources are efficiently used, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** An LLIN distribution involves surveying people to determine the need for LLINs; delivering LLINs; and promoting the use of LLINs (to read our notes from visiting an ongoing LLIN distribution, see our page on October 201 site visits).
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that is conducted before the intervention—surveying to assess need. This pre-intervention data collection is analogous to gathering baseline data, which can help ensure that the distribution targets areas with the greatest need, thus potentially improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In most studies, coverage of ITNs was very low prior to the program (though there was often high coverage of untreated nets), and substantially higher afterward.
- **Reasoning:** This quote implies that baseline data (pre-intervention coverage levels) is collected to understand the initial state. By identifying a low baseline of ITN usage, charities can more clearly measure the impact of their intervention and justify the cost effectiveness of the strategy.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** CU conducted a pre-distribution survey and has completed a 6-month follow up study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Concern Universal collects baseline data before launching its net distribution intervention. By conducting a pre-distribution survey, CU establishes existing coverage levels and net deficits, which provides the information necessary to plan resource allocation accurately and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We asked CU why it plans to give out nets at a village meeting after registration, instead of going door-to-door and distributing nets at that time. CU said that the latter approach could cause problems if they didn't estimate enough nets to bring along ahead of time, that it wouldn't allow CU to collect good data on pre-existing net coverage, and that it would hamper transparency (villagers wouldn't have chances to review and make changes to information on how many nets were needed for each household).
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links operational process decisions—delaying distribution until after registration—to the need to collect accurate baseline data. Collecting good data on pre-existing net coverage helps ensure that net requirements are correctly estimated, thereby avoiding resource misallocation and contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process—collecting baseline need data before intervention—which is critical for ensuring that distribution efforts are based on accurate household data, thereby contributing to the cost effectiveness of the charity by potentially avoiding over- or under-allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Whether there's a shortage will not be known until the data is in regarding needed LLINs vs. usable LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores the dependency on baseline data collection to determine the gap between what is available and what is needed. This process is essential for informed decision-making in resource distribution, directly linking operational data collection with cost-effective planning.

## Code: Using pilot projects: Using trial projects when the charity enters a new location.
### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Given the short timeline, it will not be possible to pilot electronic data gathering methods (i.e. using hand-held devices) during this distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that AMF had considered a pilot (trial) of an innovative operational process—electronic data gathering—during the Ghana distribution, which could have been used to assess cost-effectiveness. However, due to time constraints, the trial project was not implemented. This suggests that while the concept of testing new approaches in a distribution setting is on the table, the document offers minimal evidence of charities systematically using trial projects in new locations to achieve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Procedural improvements (e.g. 105% verification or new accountability measures) are often trialed in one area and expanded to all 4 districts if they are successful.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Concern Universal tests new procedures in a localized trial before scaling them up, demonstrating how the charity utilizes trial projects as part of their operational process, which can lead to more efficient and cost-effective practices.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal plans to trial digital data collection during PDCUs, and aims to fully incorporate digital data collection into the 2018 mass net distribution campaign.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a forthcoming trial project in the form of digital data collection during post-distribution check-ups, indicating that the charity is experimenting with new technology to improve operational efficiency and potentially achieve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF is indirectly testing its data-driven methodologies in a new operational context. By observing the rollout in Malawi—a setting where AMF is not directly managing the process—they are effectively running a trial project to gather data and insights that may inform cost-effective practices.

- **Quote:** However, AMF believes that staggering distribution across multiple years can allow it to provide some immediate assistance while also learning from its experience in the first year and incentivizing AMF and its partners to work well together.
- **Reasoning:** This statement outlines an operational process where an initial phase of distribution serves as a trial run. The learning from the first year helps adjust and refine subsequent distributions, which is analogous to using trial projects in new locations to optimize cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_10-15-15_and_10-22-15_(p.md
- **Quote:** In Country J, AMF's net distribution negotiations have been put on hold. AMF had proposed carrying out a three-phase distribution of 3.2 million nets to pilot the use of digital electronic devices, such as smart phones and tablets, for data collection. During the pilot phase, nets would be distributed to two geographical areas that are each in need of 100,000 nets (the areas have already been identified). Approximately 1.5 million nets would be distributed in each of the following two years. The presence of a pilot phase will delay the program's ability to reach a more significant portion of the population, so AMF is eager to begin this work as soon as possible.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that AMF uses a trial (pilot) project in a new location (Country J) to test new operational methodologies—in this case, digital data collection—before scaling up their distribution. Such an approach is indicative of a strategy aimed at managing risk and potentially achieving cost effectiveness by gathering crucial operational insights prior to full-scale deployment.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF has signed an agreement with the government of DRC committing to distribute 8.4 million additional nets in the latter part of 2019, conditional on its partners performing satisfactorily in Phase 1. AMF will assess Phase 1 holistically, including quantitative performance targets as well as qualitative criteria such as: Timeliness; Quality of feedback; Receiving data as expected; Quality of relationship. All parties are aware that if AMF is dissatisfied, then AMF is legally not committed to provide the 8.4 million nets, and $16-20 million worth of support will be pulled.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates AMF’s phased approach in DRC, where the initial phase serves as a trial project. The conditional commitment for additional nets based on performance evaluation reflects an operational strategy designed to ensure that only cost-effective, well-functioning processes are scaled up.

- **Quote:** AMF invested $8.5 million in 2016 to fund the distribution of 6 million PBO nets and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) ($6 million on the additional cost of the nets compared to non-PBO nets and $2.5 million funding the RCT). The RCT results will be available in May or June of 2019. The results of the RCT will play a key role in determining how many PBO nets AMF decides to fund in the future, because it is currently unknown how effective PBO nets are, under what circumstances they are effective, or whether they are effective at all.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how AMF employs a trial project—in this case, a randomized controlled trial—to test the effectiveness (and indirectly the cost-effectiveness) of a new intervention (PBO nets). The use of trial data to guide future funding decisions is a clear example of how trial projects function as an operational tool.

- **Quote:** AMF typically finds that the first time a country implements an intervention, there are many difficulties and a large amount of work is required. But the next time, because the infrastructure is in place and the partners have experience, the intervention is easier to implement and more effective. This makes it worthwhile to stay with a country while the processes become embedded.
- **Reasoning:** This passage indicates that the initial, more challenging intervention in a new location acts as a trial run, allowing AMF to establish and embed effective processes. Learning from these early challenges helps improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness in subsequent operations.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** AMF plans to send about 250,000 nets to Malawi for CU to distribute in Ntcheu as part of a countrywide effort to cover every sleeping space. It is AMF's largest distribution to date by far and AMF told us that this program is likely to serve as a model for future distributions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote implies that the current large-scale distribution is being used as a model—a trial project—to refine operational processes that could be replicated in new locations, suggesting an underlying aim of achieving cost effectiveness through a tested model.

- **Quote:** In the previous distribution, CU piloted the pre-registration system.
- **Reasoning:** This direct statement provides evidence that CU uses a trial (pilot) approach to test new operational procedures. By piloting the pre-registration system, the organization is exploring methods to improve its process efficiency, which can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CU generally wouldn't do a one off project like what they are going to do with the net distribution and are carrying one out this time because of the length of time with which they have worked with Ntcheu District Council and its relevance to their objective of building District capacity on service delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the net distribution is an exception—a one-off (trial) project—motivated by strategic partnerships. Although it doesn’t explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the emphasis on building local capacity suggests an operational approach designed to leverage existing infrastructure for more efficient (and potentially cost effective) service delivery.

### Doc Name: Cost-effectiveness.md
- **Quote:** Second, we have an operating model that has proved highly effective: a lean organisational structure, significant leveraging of technology and a pro bono partnership and distribution partner model. This means our costs are exceptionally low.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the charity employs an operational process—specifically, a distribution partner model along with pro bono partnerships and technology leverage—that minimizes costs. The mention of a 'distribution partner model' suggests that local partners play a role in executing interventions, thereby implicitly enhancing their ability to conduct these interventions cost‐effectively.

- **Quote:** Third, we place great emphasis on the preparation, carrying out and follow up of distributions to ensure the potential impact of distributing nets is realised. We report on this transparently and in detail.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights rigorous operational processes in planning, executing, and monitoring interventions. Although it does not explicitly state local partner capacity building, the thorough operational approach likely supports and enhances the performance of distribution partners, contributing indirectly to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: What we do.md
- **Quote:** We fund anti-malaria nets, specifically long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIINs), and work with distribution partners to ensure they are used.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the charity's operational process of collaborating with local distribution partners. By partnering with those on the ground, the charity leverages local expertise to ensure that nets reach communities efficiently. This collaboration is an example of how empowering local partners can maximize the impact of interventions, which in turn can contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity.

- **Quote:** 100% of the funds we receive from the public buys nets. We achieve this because we have a significant level of pro bono support from organisations and individuals. Every donation is linked to a distribution so donors see where their nets go. We publish all the donations we receive.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores an operational model that minimizes overhead costs, ensuring that all donor funds are directly used for purchasing nets. The successful integration of pro bono support, alongside the effective engagement of local distribution partners, indirectly contributes to cost effectiveness by streamlining operations and maximizing the use of available funds.

- **Quote:** Post-distribution net surveys are carried out every six months to assess net use and condition. Monthly malaria case rate data is gathered from all health centres in a distribution zone. This information helps show net impact and determine where additional community-led malaria education activities and net hang-up campaigns are appropriate. We publish all the data we collect.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the monitoring processes that involve local health centres—key local partners—in gathering post-intervention data. By systematically assessing net usage and malaria case data, the charity enables local partners to refine intervention strategies, ensuring resources are deployed where they are most needed. This operational process supports cost effectiveness by facilitating targeted, evidence-based interventions.

### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** Distribution partners pay for the costs of distributing the nets (with one exception currently). This means all donations from the public buy nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local distribution partners absorb distribution costs. By doing so, the charity minimizes administrative expenses, ensuring that 100% of public donations are used for purchasing nets. This directly ties local partners’ involvement to the cost effectiveness of the charity.

- **Quote:** A pre-distribution surey is carried out with visits to all households in a distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and perfectly usable nets already in place. This ensures a household needing three nets will receive three nets, not two or four. Detailed beneficiary lists are screened for 'ghost names' by being read out in public by community leaders. Independent supervision at the 'moment of distribution' ensures the 'no show, no net' rule is followed and helps avoid nets being misappropriated.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines several operational processes that enhance the precision and reliability of interventions. Involving local community leaders and independent supervision increases accountability and reduces resource wastage. These measures improve the ability of local partners to conduct their interventions efficiently, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** AMF identifies and approaches organisations, potential distribution partners, that may have the resources and necessary experience in-country to participate in a net distribution. Participation may include carrying out PDCUs, other monitoring activities during the pre-distribution or distribution phase, or taking a significant management, planning or operational role in the distribution itself.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF’s operational process includes selecting local partners based on their resources and in-country experience. By doing so, the process is designed to bolster the partners' ability to conduct interventions, which can contribute to cost-effectiveness by leveraging local expertise and minimizing inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** pre-distribution activity in the area to receive nets to establish: a list of beneficiaries, specifically the net need per individual household; full cooperation and involvement of local community leaders and health officers; a plan for the receipt, transport, distribution, malaria-education, delivery to all beneficiaries, hanging and post-distribution follow up of the nets
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of pre-distribution activities highlights how local partners are systematically engaged in planning and executing multiple facets of the intervention. Such structured operational processes likely improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the intervention, indirectly enhancing cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** 1. Accurate household-level net need data

What? Number of sleeping spaces and existing usable nets. Why? So we know exactly how many nets each household needs. It is important data is recent and accurate. This helps avoid both over-delivery and under-delivery of nets to households. Over-delivery of nets is wasteful. This can occur if perfectly usable nets are not counted with households receiving four nets when they might only need two. Under-delivery of nets can leave sleeping spaces uncovered and this can compromise breaking transmission.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a key operational process—collecting and using accurate household-level data—that enables local partners to precisely assess net needs. By preventing both over- and under-delivery, this process minimizes waste and ensures resources are efficiently allocated, which in turn supports the cost effectiveness of the charity’s work.

- **Quote:** 2. Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution'

What? Individuals not connected with the communities receiving nets or the government health teams involved in the distribution, are present whenever a net is handed out. They check the beneficiary is identified on the net distribution list and the 'no show, no net' rule is applied. Why? This ensures nets reach those who need them and reduces to an immaterial level the misappropriation of nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where independent supervision is utilized to oversee the distribution of nets. By ensuring that nets are delivered only to the intended beneficiaries and reducing the risk of misappropriation, the process improves the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: Distribution Partners.md
- **Quote:** AMF works with the National Malaria Control Programme (IMRC) in each country and with specific distribution partners for each distribution who may take full operational responsibility for a distribution or may have specific monitoring and evaluation roles in line with the high levels of data-led accountability AMF requires.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains an operational process where local partners are selected for their capacity to manage distributions and conduct monitoring and evaluation. It implies that by leveraging local expertise and data-led accountability, the charity can streamline operations, which may contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We first speak with National Malaria Control Programmes and other organisations to establish net need in a country and attitude to accountability, which can then lead to more detailed discussions and identifying in-country distribution partners.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details a pre-intervention operational process of assessing local needs and partner accountability. Although it does not directly mention cost effectiveness, the careful selection and assessment of partners based on local conditions and accountability is likely intended to ensure efficient use of resources, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Information we publish.md
- **Quote:** A two-page, twenty-question document summarises where a distribution will take place and all planning, operational and follow-up elements. This is completed by a distribution partner and approved by our Malaria Advisory Group.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a structured operational process involving local partners in planning interventions. Though it doesn’t explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the thorough preparation and oversight implied here suggest that well-planned operations could lead to more efficient resource use and, potentially, lower costs.

- **Quote:** A household-level survey is carried out by the distribution partner to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of perfectly usable LIUIs already in place. This net need, per household, forms the basis of the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where local partners gather detailed local data to determine actual needs. While it does not directly link this process to cost effectiveness, the use of such targeted data could reduce waste and improve resource allocation, which are important aspects of cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 2013 08 15 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF is partnering with Concern Universal (CU) in Balaka and Dedza. Robin Todd, the former head of CU in Malawi, moved on from Malawi, and these staffing changes contributed to the delays.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights challenges in the operational processes of a local partner. Although it does not explicitly discuss improvements or cost effectiveness, it implies that stable and effective local management may be critical; the delays caused by staffing changes suggest that enhancing operational processes could improve intervention efficiency and potentially reduce costs.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducted an audit of the malaria case rate data measuring malaria rates in the regions served by AMF's distribution there ... The audit found that the numbers from some of the health centers are less reliable than previously thought due to staff absences, lack of qualified testing personnel, or equipment stock outs, each of which could have led to under-reporting of malaria cases. Also, at times, local health staff reported "people receiving anti-malaria treatment" as opposed to "people diagnosed with malaria by a rapid diagnostic test."
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes an operational process (a data audit) conducted by a local partner, revealing issues related to data quality due to operational shortcomings. While it does not directly link improved operational processes to cost effectiveness, it suggests that enhancing local partners’ capacities—for example, by ensuring qualified personnel and reliable equipment—might result in more accurate monitoring of intervention outcomes, indirectly contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Don de Savigny 10-22-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's initial model was successful in providing smaller numbers of nets (e.g., ~5,000 to 50,000) to local NGOs to work at the sub-national level in support of national programs. These distributions had relatively high oversight because of implementation by local on-the-ground NGOs. This allowed AMF to ask for a high degree of reporting detail from each partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that utilizing local NGOs for intervention delivery supports high oversight and detailed reporting—an operational process that can ensure effective use of resources and possibly improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It was also successful at a moderate scale, funding a few hundred thousand nets with an NGO partner in Malawi.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that working with local NGO partners has been effective even at a moderately larger scale, suggesting that local operational processes can efficiently scale interventions, which is an important factor in maintaining or enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF has had success in Malawi, at the 250,000 net level, collecting six-monthly post-distribution net use and check-up information, sampling 5% of households receiving nets. The results are impressive.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that systematic monitoring and evaluation processes, conducted via local partners, yield impressive outcomes. Such operational processes not only ensure that the intervention is properly maintained but also contribute to accountability and potentially improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_6-30-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF and other funders are considering an independent audit. This will include an examination of the existing data for signs of fraud, and visits to 20 randomly-selected villages: 10 in the Eastern Region and 10 in the Western Region. In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a set of operational processes—such as independent audits, re-registration, and oversight by partner organizations—that increase the reliability of intervention data. Although the text does not directly link these processes to cost effectiveness, ensuring accurate data helps optimize resource allocation and reduces waste, thereby indirectly contributing to the cost effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

- **Quote:** PDCUs are ongoing and all new data are being entered into AMF's data entry system (DES).
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the implementation of a centralized data entry system as part of an operational process. Streamlined data management can enhance local partners’ monitoring and reporting capabilities, which is essential in making interventions more efficient and, by extension, cost effective.

- **Quote:** Data are being entered at a rate of about one province per month. This is all being done through Rotary International.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how AMF leverages partnerships—in this case with Rotary International—to ensure systematic and timely data collection. Effective coordination with local or partner organizations facilitates intervention management, which can lead to improved cost effectiveness by ensuring interventions are executed efficiently.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md
- **Quote:** AMF's post-distribution surveys have been a part of AMF's long-term goals since the beginning of the organization. AMF wants this information as accountability for donors and to ensure that it is working with partners who have an ongoing commitment and relationship with the community.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that AMF embeds post-distribution surveys into its operational processes in order to maintain accountability and gauge partner commitment. This systematic approach helps ensure that local partners are effectively engaging with communities, which can contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of interventions by safeguarding proper use of resources.

- **Quote:** AMF is starting to rate partners on "Efficient and easy to work with?" "Did what they say they would do?" and "Timely provision of reports, photos, video." AMF seeks to be as quantitative and transparent as possible with these ratings and uses a series of checklists and time-stamped documents to make the ratings.
- **Reasoning:** This passage reveals a structured partner rating system that quantifies and monitors local partners' performance. By employing checklists and time-stamped documentation, AMF enhances its ability to select and maintain effective partners, thereby potentially increasing the cost effectiveness of its operations.

- **Quote:** Anyone who doesn't carry out a post-distribution survey (without very strong justification) would be given a 2-star rating or less and AMF would not work with them again.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that AMF enforces strict operational standards by penalizing partners who fail to conduct essential post-distribution surveys. This quality control mechanism ensures that only partners who adhere to operational protocols are engaged, which likely contributes to more efficient and cost-effective charitable interventions.

- **Quote:** AMK wants to have a system where partners proactively come back to it and indicate that they have followed up on AMF's suggestions for improvement.
- **Reasoning:** Although briefly mentioned, this statement reflects an intent to implement a feedback loop, where partners report back on improvements. Such proactive engagement supports continuous operational enhancement, which is a critical factor in improving the overall cost effectiveness of charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** "105%" data collection process - In some countries, such as Malawi, AMF distribution partners conduct a two-step, "105%" data collection process. A first wave of data collectors collect registration data from all households in a given area (i.e. 100% data collection). A separate, smaller group of data collectors then visits unannounced 5% of the households which are randomly selected and collects the same registration data. This second set of data collectors does not have sight of the original data set at any stage. The 5% overlap data is then compared. Before the entire data collection process starts, both sets of data collectors are made aware of the 5% checking process and AMF reports that this motivates the first wave of data collectors to do high-quality work.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of the '105% data collection process' illustrates an operational mechanism designed to enhance the accuracy and accountability of local data collectors. By ensuring high-quality registration data, this process helps in proper resource allocation, reducing errors and waste, which is a key contributor to the overall cost effectiveness of charitable interventions.

- **Quote:** Community verification of registration data - Each household in the district is visited and listed, and the data is transferred into electronic format. The data is then analysed and cleaned, for example, i) inconsistencies (e.g. 4 people in a household, 2 adults and 3 children) or ii) likely errors often identified through analysis of certain ratios (e.g. a ratio of people/net of 1, perhaps with 4 people in a household and 4 nets stated being required, given that typically 2 people sleep under a net on average) are identified and flagged for review. A printed draft beneficiary list is returned to each community so they can review the accuracy of the information. AMF does not believe its distributions miss a material number of households in the registration process, if any.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details an operational process where local partners are actively involved in verifying the accuracy of registration data. Such a method helps in minimizing errors and ensuring that nets are distributed to the correct households, thereby preventing resource waste and contributing indirectly to the cost effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

- **Quote:** The Malawi NMCP has been impressed by aspects of the AMF model, and adopted a number of elements of it for its recent distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This statement provides evidence that local partners recognize the value of AMF’s operational processes. The adoption of these elements by the Malawi NMCP demonstrates that improved local operational capabilities are seen as effective and likely to result in more efficient, cost-effective interventions.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducts pre-distribution registration surveys in the four districts in Malawi it carries out net distributions in. These surveys are conducted in cooperation with traditional leaders and local health officials. The purpose of the surveys is to determine how many nets are needed for the upcoming net distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where local partners collect precise data to determine needs before the intervention. By accurately assessing net requirements, the process helps avoid resource wastage, which is a key contributor to enhancing the cost effectiveness of charitable interventions.

- **Quote:** After information is collected and verified, Concern Universal creates a distribution planning document which:
* Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc.
* Allocates a number of nets to be delivered to each location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a detailed logistical planning process that minimizes travel distances and optimizes resource allocation. Such efficient planning reduces unnecessary costs and ensures that the intervention is delivered effectively, thereby improving the overall cost effectiveness of the charity's operations.

- **Quote:** Procedures are generally the same across districts, but procedural improvements (e.g. 105% verification or new accountability measures) are often trialed in one area and expanded to all 4 districts if they are successful. Concern Universal plans to trial digital data collection during PDCUs, and aims to fully incorporate digital data collection into the 2018 mass net distribution campaign.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the iterative refinement and standardization of operational processes among local partners. By adopting successful innovations and streamlining procedures, the organization enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of interventions, which likely contributes to better cost management and overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md
- **Quote:** Second, it is sensible for us to consider the performance of a distribution partner in our assessment of for whom we fund nets. We have many times more requests for nets than we can fulfill (we could fund an additional $10 million in proposals right away if we had the money) and whilst criteria for assessing a distribution proposal will always include the area being badly affected by malaria, our confidence in how a distribution partner will manage pre, during and post-distribution activities is relevant. We want to make sure we are only working with the best organizations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where AMF assesses how local partners manage all phases of net distribution, ensuring that funding is directed to the most capable organizations. By rigorously evaluating partner performance, they aim to improve intervention effectiveness, which is fundamental to enhancing the cost effectiveness of their charitable work.

- **Quote:** We believe that rating distribution partners, as long as it is fair, clear and transparent, and open to challenge by the distribution partner if they disagree with our assessment, can contribute to improved distribution performance, both for them and us.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the use of a systematic rating process as an operational tool to provide feedback and drive improvements in local partners’ delivery of interventions. Improved distribution performance, achieved through such operational processes, can lead to more effective use of resources and thereby contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how AMF’s operational process—its data-driven methodology—is being adopted by a local partner (the NMCP in Malawi) for intervention delivery. By empowering local partners with these systems, AMF likely enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the distribution process, which can contribute to cost effectiveness through improved execution and reduced waste.

- **Quote:** AMF is aware its work could serve to spread its accountability standards and practices, and this can be helped to be achieved by funding more distributions at scale (high hundreds of thousands of nets and above) to generate more data to share with the wider malaria community as to how AMF's practices impact malaria rates.
- **Reasoning:** This statement suggests that spreading robust operational processes and accountability standards among partners can generate valuable performance data. This, in turn, can lead to more informed and efficient interventions, ultimately supporting the charity’s cost effectiveness by enabling targeted improvements and resource optimization.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 1 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that leverages local partners—HSAs and community leaders—to ensure accurate data collection. By minimizing the risk of misinformation (such as underreporting to receive extra resources), this enhanced local involvement can help avoid resource waste and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program made several suggestions for the Ntcheu distribution by Concern:
  * HSAs should not distribute LLINs alone - an HSA Supervisor and village headman/headwoman should be present for any distribution.
  * Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
  * Concern should have an allocation in its budget for community sensitization.
  * Concern should be mindful of setting up distribution sites so that people don't have to travel too far.
  * Getting the numbers right (re: how many LLINs each household needs) is crucial.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed list of recommendations emphasizes multiple operational processes—supervised distribution, district coordination, budgeting for community outreach, strategic site selection, and accurate needs assessment. These practices support local partners in executing interventions efficiently, which can contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s efforts.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program asked whether Concern could delay their HSA training so that someone representing the district could be present.
- **Reasoning:** This exchange highlights the importance of integrating local expertise (via district representation) into training sessions. Coordinated training among local partners is an operational process that can enhance intervention delivery and reduce potential errors, indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_10-15-15_and_10-22-15_(p.md
- **Quote:** Additionally, the country's relatively sophisticated health system might enable AMF to collaborate directly with the MoH on distribution efforts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how AMF leverages existing local structures (in this case, the Ministry of Health) to facilitate intervention delivery. By collaborating directly with local partners who already have operational capacity, AMF may reduce overheads and improve efficiency, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF is eager to expand its work to new countries, such as Country K and Country J. This will increase AMF's opportunities to participate in future projects, and new partners will gain exposure to AMF's methodologies (e.g. data collection practices).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF intentionally transmits its operational processes—specifically data collection practices—to new local partners. By enhancing the operational abilities of these partners to conduct interventions, the charity potentially streamlines implementation and reduces costs, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** His role has been to assess potential NGO partners, participate in the planning process, meet with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), and help with course corrections (for example, when it was realized that there was no plan for transporting registration coupon books to the data entry center).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF actively monitors and adjusts operational processes by engaging with local partners and correcting procedural gaps. These course corrections enhance the partners’ capacity to implement interventions efficiently, which can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing logistical errors and resource wastage.

- **Quote:** AMF believes the data entry system will enable it to check on Episcopal Relief & Development's progress without having to consult with, and take up additional time, of individual staff members.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores the use of an electronic data entry system managed by local partners to streamline monitoring and reduce oversight costs. By improving accountability and operational efficiency, the system indirectly supports cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Because registration volunteers are from the community, they understand and know how to be sensitive to different household situations and dynamics.
- **Reasoning:** Leveraging local volunteers who possess community-specific knowledge improves the registration process. This operational approach enhances the effectiveness of the intervention by minimizing cultural missteps and errors, thereby potentially lowering costs associated with inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Most of ADDRO's implementation costs for this distribution, including staff time, transportation, data center costs, and volunteer incentives (the 10 GHt/month incentive equates to roughly $2.50/month per volunteer) are being covered through a combination of funding from AMF along with a cost share from Episcopal Relief & Development.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the funding and cost-sharing arrangements that enable local partners to execute operational tasks at a lower cost. Such efficient resource allocation and operational support directly relate to improved cost effectiveness in charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: NMCP_Ghana_08-16-16_to_08-18-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** The NMCP has been working with AMF for a relatively short period of time. Their working relationship has proceeded relatively smoothly thus far, especially since AMF has shown willingness to negotiate on some areas to conform with the country's specific scenario.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the operational process of negotiation and adaptation between AMF and the local partner (NMCP), demonstrating how flexibility in operational processes can improve the local partner's ability to conduct interventions, which may in turn enhance the overall cost effectiveness of charity investments.

- **Quote:** During negotiations, AMF requested household tracing, which requires tracking the nets in order to ensure they reach their intended recipients.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process—household tracing—that aims to ensure accountability and proper delivery of nets. Such tracking mechanisms help reduce wastage and misallocation of resources, indirectly contributing to the cost effectiveness of the charity's intervention.

- **Quote:** In future distributions, the NMCP would like to apply a batch number to the nets in each bale in order to more efficiently track whether they reached the intended destination.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates planned improvements in operational processes (using batch numbers for tracking) that would empower the local partner (NMCP) to monitor logistics more effectively. Enhancements like these can reduce errors and inefficiencies, thereby potentially increasing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF found it highly difficult to identify a low-cost partner for PDMs in Togo. Simultaneously, it decided to pursue a strategy of fully electronic data collection. This will result in missed PDM activities (the first round of data collection is scheduled for March of 2019), although AMF believes this loss is outweighed by the opportunity to build the national Ministry of Health's capacity for large-scale electronic data collection. Although AMF's new strategy has been challenging due to unreliable internet connection as well as lack of expertise and infrastructure, it has found in-country partners to be diligent and cooperative. Government officials from Togo have expressed a willingness and capability to collect large-scale registration and distribution data electronically in 2020. AMF has also established partnerships with L'Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Demographiques (INSEED), a Togolese organization with significant experience in data collection with electronic devices, and Le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Paludisme (PNLP), which will be responsible for working with health centers to conduct PDMs. INSEED will monitor the PDM processes carried out by PNLP.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where AMF opts for a fully electronic data collection strategy to overcome the challenge of finding a low-cost partner. By investing in building the national Ministry of Health’s capacity and establishing local partnerships (with INSEED and PNLP), the organization aims to enhance local partners' ability to conduct interventions. This capacity-building is positioned as a trade-off—accepting short-term losses in routine monitoring for long-term gains—which can contribute to the charity's overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Due to the challenging landscape in PNG (e.g., some nets are distributed by air), AMF found it difficult to find a partner for PDMs. After speaking with various organizations, it decided to partner with Rotarians Against Malaria (RAM), which is the Global Fund Principal Recipient for work in PNG. Since being designated as such, RAM has had to adjust to distributing larger quantities of nets. However, RAM now has the capacity to conduct PDMs moving forward. AMF's agreement with RAM is largely in place although budgets are still being finalized.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how AMF responded to operational challenges in a difficult environment by partnering with a local organization (RAM) that could adapt to increased responsibilities. By doing so, AMF is enhancing the local partner's capacity to conduct post-distribution monitoring (PDMs), potentially leading to a more efficient and cost-effective monitoring process over time.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_9-9-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** When AMF began working with a new partner in DRC, there were some inefficiencies in the reporting process, and AMF created a series of templates to simplify the process and reduce the amount of work necessary for both AMF and the partner. AMF also leveraged technology to reduce its workload in reporting to various authorities. These two changes have reduced the amount of time spent on financial reporting by a factor of 5-10. These new systems have also enabled AMF to have current financial information available on its website.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that by implementing standardized templates and leveraging technology, AMF improved the operational efficiency of both its internal team and its local partner, reducing time and effort in reporting. Such process improvements can lower operational costs, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity's interventions.

- **Quote:** AMF now posts pre-distribution registration survey operations plans on its website. This became formalized as part of the effort to increase efficiency during the busy period about 9 months ago. This will be part of the typical documentation for distributions in the future, except in cases where it creates an unnecessary burden. AMF is willing to be flexible, but hopes that the partner finds this to be a helpful way of communicating and summarizing plans.
- **Reasoning:** Here, the formalization of pre-distribution survey operations plans enhances communication and planning with local partners. Improved operational processes like this streamline interventions, reducing potential errors and delays, which in turn can lead to more cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** Because of the large distances between villages and the nature of infrastructure in Nord-Ubangi, it is necessary to accurately estimate how many nets are needed in each village when pre-positioning them before distributions, because it is costly to transport them more than necessary. It is likely more cost-effective to gather and run logistics and operations on very detailed and reliable data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly connects precision in operational planning—through detailed data collection and accurate estimation—to cost savings. By ensuring that only the necessary resources are transported, local partners can avoid wasteful spending, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Smartphones will be used in Nord-Ubangi for pre-distribution registration surveys, distributions, data collection, and some parts of verification. The verification process involves collecting data electronically, printing out lists to show to community leaders, making annotations on the printed lists, using these annotated lists to verify data in villages, and then using smartphones during distributions to record what is distributed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the adoption of technology (smartphones) in the intervention process, improving data collection and verification procedures for local partners. While it does not explicitly mention cost savings, the operational improvement implied here is likely to reduce errors and inefficiencies, thereby supporting cost-effective implementation.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather 5-23-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** There was a delay of eight months in AMF's distribution in Balaka District for two reasons First, errors in data collection led to the pilot pre-distribution registration survey (pilot PDRS) having to be re-done and, some of the results of the full PDRS were implausible, so a portion of the PDRS had to be redone. This resulted in a delay of four months. Second, available net production slots across the candidate net manufacturers contributed a further four months delay. CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an operational process where a local partner (Concern Universal) actively addressed data collection errors to ensure accurate intervention planning. Improved data reliability, as highlighted here, can help prevent costly mistakes and inefficiencies, thereby contributing indirectly to the overall cost effectiveness of charitable interventions.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-28-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF learns about net gaps and receives funding requests through its network in the malaria control community, particularly through the Alliance for Malaria Prevention and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance. As it becomes involved in larger distributions, AMF is receiving a growing number of funding requests. As its funding increases, AMF aims to make more strategic investments by engaging in the planning cycles of countries where it has strong connections and experience.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where AMF leverages its local networks and participates in country planning cycles. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, engaging local partners and aligning with national planning likely improves the efficiency and targeting of interventions, factors that can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In order to ensure accurate net need estimates, AMF distributions include comprehensive household-level pre-distribution surveys. Without these surveys, estimates might be based on an out-of-date or incomplete population census.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details an operational process—conducting pre-distribution surveys—that ensures accurate estimation of net needs. Improved data collection at the local level helps prevent misallocation of resources, thereby potentially enhancing the cost effectiveness of interventions.

- **Quote:** AMF has hired a consultant to increase its capacity in Ghana. The consultant has a significant amount of experience in Ghana.
- **Reasoning:** Hiring a local consultant to bolster capacity in Ghana is an operational process aimed at strengthening localized expertise. Although the link to cost effectiveness is implicit, enhancing local capacity can improve intervention execution and resource allocation, contributing indirectly to cost effective outcomes.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF is trying to bring best practices to net distributions in the countries where it works, including greater accountability and more efficient processes. AMF typically finds that the first time a country implements an intervention, there are many difficulties and a large amount of work is required. But the next time, because the infrastructure is in place and the partners have experience, the intervention is easier to implement and more effective. This makes it worthwhile to stay with a country while the processes become embedded. In countries it has previously supported, AMF has significantly improved accountability, data collection, and monitoring. AMF believes that if it ended its involvement in countries it has previously worked in (in order to provide all of its available funding to distributions in DRC in 2020), those countries would be at risk of losing the accountability improvements that AMF achieved in previous distributions, even if the net gap were covered.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how embedding best practices and operational processes—such as enhanced accountability, systematic data collection, and monitoring—improves the capacity of local partners. These improvements make subsequent interventions easier and more effective, contributing to cost effectiveness by reducing additional operational risks and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** AMF believes that it adds value through more detailed procedures and significantly more focus on data. This makes it more likely that more nets reach their intended destination, so further nets are available to cover the gaps. Uganda and Guinea provide two examples: In Uganda, AMF proposed several accountability and operations requirements which it felt would lead to better governance of the distribution and better outcomes. These were adopted not only in the areas in which AMF funded nets, but in the rest of the country as well. In Guinea, AMF was able to reduce a $14 million funding gap to $8 million by reducing the size of the nets, eliminating unnecessary packaging, and not running distributions in areas where nets were not needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that by implementing more detailed operational procedures and focusing on data, local partners are better equipped to conduct interventions. This enhanced effectiveness in operations translates into cost savings—such as narrowing funding gaps—as resources are used more efficiently and wastage is minimized.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF then drafts an agreement for the NMCP, which typically includes the specifics of AMF's approach to operations, data collection, and accountability.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that AMF establishes clear operational guidelines with local partners (NMCPs), ensuring that the processes for running distributions and collecting data are standardized. Enhanced operational processes can lead to cost effectiveness by reducing inconsistencies and inefficiencies in interventions.

- **Quote:** AMF's requirements are quite specific in some respects, with the intention of enabling countries to deliver what AMF needs based on what AMF has learned about best practices.
- **Reasoning:** The specificity in AMF’s operational requirements shows that the charity leverages best practices to work with local partners. By improving the partners' ability to conduct interventions effectively, these operational processes contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness, ensuring funds are used where they yield the most impact.

- **Quote:** For example, AMF requires household registration data that is collected on paper to be converted to electronic form at a data entry center. Previously, AMF had let each country decide how to handle data entry, but found that this resulted in countries using a wide range of different numbers of data entry centers, which sometimes created issues with inconsistent data entry practices, lack of internet access, bureaucratic complexity, etc. AMF learned that it is more effective for it to require that countries use a single data entry center.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides a concrete example of how refining operational processes (centralizing data entry) improves the ability of local partners to manage data collection efficiently. Improved consistency and reduced logistical challenges can contribute to cost effectiveness by minimizing errors and streamlining the intervention process.

- **Quote:** AMF aims to ensure that countries it works with have a good operational plan that is properly resourced and scheduled to enable effective delivery. To accomplish that, AMF ideally begins planning for distributions 12 to 24 months out, which gives it more time to set up good distribution practices. AMF considers 18 months the comfortable minimum amount of time in which to plan a net distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes the importance of early and well-structured planning in operational processes. By allowing sufficient time to establish effective distribution practices, local partners are better equipped to execute interventions efficiently, which likely enhances the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s efforts.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** After information is collected and verified, Concern Universal creates a distribution planning document which: Assigns each village to a distribution site, with a goal of minimizing the distance that beneficiaries need to travel (most beneficiaries travel 4-5 miles to their distribution site). Each catchment area is divided into several distribution sites, and each site serves 2-12 villages, depending on the geographic location, number of nets to be distributed, etc.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process used by a local partner in Malawi that optimizes distribution logistics by minimizing travel distances. By reducing distance-related inefficiencies, such processes can lower distribution costs, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** IMA believes point distributions rather than at-household distribution will be more cost-effective.
- **Reasoning:** This direct statement from IMA, a local partner in DRC, links a change in operational process (using point distributions) to improved cost effectiveness. It highlights that modifying intervention methods can reduce costs, supporting the notion that enhanced operational processes contribute to charitable cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** Identify distribution partners (in-country non-profit organizations or government agencies) to carry out LLIN distributions. AMF and its partners agree on expectations for the distribution, including who pays for costs other than the purchase price of LLINs, the process that will be used to carry out the distribution, and what information will be collected and shared with AMF.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly explains how AMF improves its operational processes by clearly defining roles and procedures with local partners. By setting expectations for the distribution process, AMF ensures that local partners are effectively equipped to conduct the intervention, which contributes to the overall cost effectiveness by minimizing errors and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Registration: During the registration process, national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door in targeted areas to collect the information used to determine the number of LLINs to allocate to each household (e.g., the number of sleeping spaces and/or the number of household members), as well as the information used to identify the household for the distribution and post-distribution surveys.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process involving local partners. By engaging local staff and volunteers in detailed household registration, AMF refines the targeting and allocation of nets. Such precise data collection by local partners helps in efficiently matching supply with demand, thereby supporting cost effective use of resources.

- **Quote:** Processes for ensuring that nets reach their intended recipients and monitoring whether they remain in homes and in good condition over the long-term.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the significance of robust operational processes in the distribution and post-distribution monitoring stages. By establishing systems that both deliver nets effectively through local partners and monitor net usage and condition over time, AMF enhances the intervention’s effectiveness, which is a critical component in achieving high cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** For the distribution, they have determined that it's important to rely on existing infrastructure such as a Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), government health workers who each cover a few villages.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how CU leverages existing local infrastructure by engaging HSAs to conduct the distribution. By utilizing local partners already embedded in the community, the intervention is more likely to be executed efficiently and at lower cost, which supports cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CU generally wouldn't do a one off project like what they are going to do with the net distribution and are carrying one out this time because of the length of time with which they have worked with Ntcheu District Council and its relevance to their objective of building District capacity on service delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational strategy centered on building and maintaining local capacity through longstanding relationships with partners such as the District Council. Strengthening local capacity is an operational process that can lower overhead and improve sustainability, thereby enhancing the cost effectiveness of the charity's interventions.

- **Quote:** Each HSA is to have 4 days per village to collect data: 3 to go door to door and one to check/consolidate/clean up. They explained how to recognize a usable net (it has to be an LLIN and there are rules about how many holes are OK).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the systematic training and data collection process designed to empower local HSAs. By ensuring that local partners are well-trained and capable of collecting and verifying accurate data, the process minimizes errors and resource wastage, which contributes to a more cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** CU conducted a pre-distribution survey and has completed a 6-month follow up study.
- **Reasoning:** This evidence shows that CU uses rigorous monitoring and evaluation as part of its operational process. Such practices allow for data-driven decision-making and adjustments in resource allocation, ultimately enhancing the cost effectiveness of the charity's intervention strategy.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages local partners—HSAs and community leaders—to ensure accurate data collection. By improving local data reliability, the process can lead to more precise resource allocation and reduced waste, which are key components of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores the strategic coordination between the charity and local district authorities. Such integration of local partners enhances the operational capacity of interventions, potentially lowering redundant efforts and thus contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program asked whether Concern could delay their HSA training so that someone representing the district could be present.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an effort to synchronize training activities between the charity's team and local stakeholders. Adjusting training schedules to include district representation can improve local partner engagement and operational quality, which is an indirect contributor to cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Concern should be mindful of setting up distribution sites so that people don't have to travel too far.
- **Reasoning:** This operational recommendation reflects a logistical strategy aimed at reducing travel burdens for beneficiaries. Making distribution sites more accessible can streamline the intervention process and minimize costs related to inefficient site placement.

- **Quote:** Concern should have an allocation in its budget for community sensitization.
- **Reasoning:** By emphasizing budget allocation for community sensitization, this quote points to an important operational process that empowers local partners to effectively communicate and engage with the community. Enhanced community engagement can lead to better-targeted interventions and, in turn, cost savings.

## Code: Securing local buy-in: Ensuring support for the charity’s intervention among local stakeholders.
### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** Detailed beneficiary lists are screened for 'ghost names' by being read out in public by community leaders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where local stakeholder support is secured by involving community leaders in verifying beneficiary lists. By ensuring that community figures are actively engaged, the charity fosters local buy-in which underpins trust, transparency, and ultimately helps guarantee that resources (i.e., nets) are allocated efficiently, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** AMF discusses with the NNCP and other parties whether there is a need for nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF engages with key local and national stakeholders (such as the National Malaria Control Programme) to assess local needs before an intervention. By doing so, the charity secures local buy-in, which is likely to ensure that resources are allocated appropriately and avoided wastage, thereby contributing to the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** pre-distribution activity in the area to receive nets to establish: a list of beneficiaries, specifically the net need per individual household; full cooperation and involvement of local community leaders and health officers; a plan for the receipt, transport, distribution, malaria-education, delivery to all beneficiaries, hanging and post-distribution follow up of the nets
- **Reasoning:** This passage details an operational process that involves obtaining full cooperation and active involvement from local community leaders and health officers. This local stakeholder support is integral to effective planning and execution of the intervention, which in turn helps reduce inefficiencies and costs, thereby enhancing the charity’s cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** When deciding to fund nets for a distribution, we look for two things: areas with a malaria problem where there is also a need for nets, and distribution partners with whom we are comfortable working.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the charity’s deliberate process of selecting local distribution partners—a key operational step to secure local stakeholder support. By choosing partners they trust, the intervention is more likely to be locally grounded, which helps ensure that resources are used efficiently and cost-effectively.

- **Quote:** Would the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) agree to the four main requirements we have of a distribution?
- **Reasoning:** This question from the assessment process shows that the charity seeks explicit endorsement from a major local stakeholder. Securing agreement from the NMCP is a way of ensuring local buy-in, which in turn supports cost-effective outcomes by aligning the intervention with local health priorities and practices.

- **Quote:** Are there potential distribution partners with the necessary resources and experience with whom we could collaborate?
- **Reasoning:** This operational check emphasizes the need to partner with capable local stakeholders. Ensuring that distribution partners have the local expertise and resources promotes effective implementation and minimizes waste, thereby contributing to the cost-effectiveness of the charity’s intervention.

### Doc Name: Distribution Partners.md
- **Quote:** AMF works with the National Malaria Control Programme (IMRC) in each country and with specific distribution partners for each distribution who may take full operational responsibility for a distribution or may have specific monitoring and evaluation roles in line with the high levels of data-led accountability
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where the charity engages local stakeholders (e.g., the National Malaria Control Programme) and selectively assigns roles (operational vs. monitoring) to partners. Such tailored engagement with local entities helps secure local buy-in, a necessary step that can lead to more efficient resource allocation, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We first speak with National Malaria Control Programmes and other organisations to establish net need in a country and attitude to accountability, which can then lead to more detailed discussions and identifying in-country distribution partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an initial engagement process that involves assessing local needs and accountability attitudes before selecting in-country partners. This step secures local stakeholder support and ensures the intervention is contextually appropriate, potentially reducing wasted resources and improving overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Don de Savigny 10-22-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's initial model was successful in providing smaller numbers of nets (e.g., ~5,000 to 50,000) to local NGOs to work at the sub-national level in support of national programs. These distributions had relatively high oversight because of implementation by local on-the-ground NGOs. This allowed AMF to ask for a high degree of reporting detail from each partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the operational process of partnering with local NGOs—which ensures local stakeholder support and buy-in—leads to enhanced oversight and detailed reporting. Such high levels of monitoring and accountability are key components in ensuring that the intervention is efficiently implemented, indirectly contributing to the charity’s cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md
- **Quote:** AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory. AMF also seeks to appeal to community leaders by telling them that if they overestimate, other communities won't get nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process where AMF secures local stakeholder support by engaging with local malaria control programs and community leaders. By requiring communication and using local data (beneficiary lists), AMF ensures that resources target underserved areas, which in turn contributes to cost effectiveness by minimizing waste and focusing funds where they are most needed.

- **Quote:** In one case in Malawi, AMF was concerned about the delays in receiving data and asked a local hospital director to check things out. She went with three staff and confirmed that the data was accurate.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows how AMF leverages local stakeholder support—in this instance, a local hospital director and her team—to validate data quality. Involving local experts not only strengthens accountability and transparency but also ensures that interventions are monitored efficiently, thereby supporting cost effectiveness of the charity’s efforts.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** A printed draft beneficiary list is returned to each community so they can review the accuracy of the information.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process designed to secure local stakeholder support by actively involving community members in verifying beneficiary information. Such engagement can foster local buy-in, which may contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring accurate data collection and reducing errors in distribution.

- **Quote:** The logistics, monitoring, and operational teams of Ghana's NMCP will be on the ground in all 3 districts, liaising with local health systems to manage and supervise distributions.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how partnering with a local stakeholder—the Ghana NMCP—integrates local oversight into the distribution process. Engaging local health systems not only secures buy-in but also enhances accountability, potentially lowering costs by streamlining operations and minimizing errors.

- **Quote:** The issue was picked up by AMF's and Concern Universal's procedures when the registration data was shown to the local health officials as part of the verification procedure.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of local health officials in identifying issues during the registration process. Their involvement serves as a quality control mechanism, ensuring comprehensive and accurate data collection, which can improve operational efficiency and thus contribute indirectly to making the charity cost effective.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** HSAs then visit villages and meet with the village leader, who accompanies the HSA through the process of door-to-door registration. Because there are no detailed maps or geographical information system data for rural Malawi, HSAs rely on the knowledge of village leaders to locate all households in the village. The presence of the village leader also lends credibility to the HSAs and makes households more likely to cooperate.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local stakeholder support is secured by involving village leaders in the registration process. Their involvement enhances the accuracy of data collection and household cooperation, which can reduce inefficiencies and contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal often does sensitization work with village leaders prior to the registration process. This encourages the leaders to feel responsible for their communities and recognize that over-reporting may lead to net shortages in other villages.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that sensitizing local stakeholders helps secure their buy-in and accountability. Such engagement can prevent data inflation and misallocation of resources, thereby supporting more efficient and cost-effective intervention delivery.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal staff then meet with traditional authorities and district health officials to explain the distribution plan and set a date for the distribution, avoiding days that conflict with other community events. Concern Universal communicates the date, time, and place of distributions verbally to village leaders, who relay the information verbally to village members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that by involving local traditional authorities and health officials in planning, the organization ensures that the distribution is well-coordinated with community schedules. This local stakeholder engagement minimizes logistical challenges and potential waste, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Upon arrival in a village, the HSA responsible for the area introduces the enumerator who will be performing PDCUs in that village to the village chief, and explains the purpose of the visit. The HSA's introduction makes the village leader more likely to trust and cooperate with the enumerator.
- **Reasoning:** This detail from the post-distribution check-up process highlights how local stakeholder involvement (via the village chief) builds trust and facilitates cooperation. Enhanced local buy-in during monitoring processes can ensure accurate feedback and reduce operational redundancies, which are key to cost-effective program management.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md
- **Quote:** At the same time, nets only protect people if they are both distributed well (which includes, amongst other things, a strong community involvement in the distribution process and effective and ongoing malaria education) and the nets continue to be used.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links strong community involvement—an element of securing local stakeholder support—to the effective and sustained use of nets. Ensuring local buy-in in the distribution process contributes to enduring net usage, which in turn enhances cost effectiveness by maximizing the intervention's impact over the net’s lifespan.

- **Quote:** We rarely if ever now work with groups that do not have a permanent or semi-permanent connection with communities.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights the operational decision to partner only with organizations that maintain enduring local connections. Such a focus on local buy-in ensures that the interventions are more likely to be properly executed and maintained, thereby supporting the charity's cost-effectiveness by improving the long-term success of its programs.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where a local stakeholder (the NMCP in Malawi) actively adopts AMF's data-driven methodologies. Such local buy-in can streamline the distribution process, reduce redundant efforts, and capitalize on local expertise, which are key factors that can contribute to making the charity more cost effective.

- **Quote:** NMCPs prefer to deal with few funding partners to minimize the number of discussions they need to have. The NMCP in Country A, for example, may have been less likely to have engaged in talks with AMF if only 500,000 nets were being discussed, or at least discussions would have been less significant to the NMCP, than is perhaps the case with the 5.5 million nets currently under discussion. This interaction between increased capacity and increased influence for AMF forms a virtuous circle, leading to a better chance of a positive outcome.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how negotiating on a large scale helps secure greater local stakeholder support. By aligning the scale of intervention with local expectations, AMF fosters quicker and more committed engagement from NMCPs, which can reduce negotiation delays and operational friction—factors that ultimately enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final-1 2011.md

Such endorsement is a clear example of local buy-in, which can help streamline operations and potentially reduce costs, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an operational process involving close coordination with local district officials. Ensuring that district-level representatives are involved is a strategy to secure local stakeholder support, which may lead to more efficient operations and indirectly help the charity become more cost effective.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program asked whether Concern could delay their HSA training so that someone representing the district could be present. Concern stated that training has already started.
- **Reasoning:** This exchange illustrates the effort to integrate local stakeholders into the charity's processes by involving district representatives in the training. Such inclusion supports local buy-in, reducing potential resistance or misalignment, and may ultimately help in executing a cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** Concern should have an allocation in its budget for community sensitization.
- **Reasoning:** This recommendation underscores an operational process aimed at engaging the local community. Allocating budget for community sensitization is a method to enhance local stakeholder support, which can improve the intervention's overall efficiency and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_10-15-15_and_10-22-15_(p.md
- **Quote:** Country K's MoH recently issued its approval for moving discussions between AMF and the NMCP to the next phase.

Such local support can streamline coordination and distribution, potentially reducing costs and thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF's potential in-country distribution partners in Country J are enthusiastic about participating in the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that local stakeholders are positively engaged and willing to collaborate. Their enthusiasm reflects effective operational processes that secure local buy-in, which can enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the charity’s intervention.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** Because registration volunteers are from the community, they understand and know how to be sensitive to different household situations and dynamics.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that leverages local human resources. By recruiting volunteers from within the community, the program secures local buy-in, reduces misunderstandings during registration, and minimizes errors. This local involvement can lower implementation costs, contributing to the charity’s cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the period leading up to the distribution, community sensitization activities are implemented to provide more community 'ownership' of the program and make people aware of the distribution date and location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how proactive community engagement is used to foster local stakeholder support. By ensuring that community members are informed and feel a sense of ownership, the intervention runs more smoothly and efficiently, which can reduce overheads and waste, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** ADDRO's front line workers are unpaid volunteers, though their work is incentivized by a small stipend of 10 GHt (≈2.50 USD) per month.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the program relies on local, low-cost labor, which is an operational choice that secures local buy-in. Utilizing community volunteers not only leverages local knowledge and trust but also minimizes labor costs, making the intervention more cost effective.

### Doc Name: NMCP_Ghana_08-16-16_to_08-18-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** The NMCP has been working with AMF for a relatively short period of time. Their working relationship has proceeded relatively smoothly thus far, especially since AMF has shown willingness to negotiate on some areas to conform with the country's specific scenario.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process in which the charity (AMF) actively negotiates and adapts its approach to align with the local context of the NMCP. Such engagement fosters local stakeholder support (local buy-in), which is critical for ensuring that interventions are appropriately tailored to local needs. This tailored approach can lead to fewer inefficiencies and better resource allocation, thereby contributing to cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** Although AMF's new strategy has been challenging due to unreliable internet connection as well as lack of expertise and infrastructure, it has found in-country partners to be diligent and cooperative. Government officials from Togo have expressed a willingness and capability to collect large-scale registration and distribution data electronically in 2020. AMF has also established partnerships with L'Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Demographiques (INSEED), a Togolese organization with significant experience in data collection with electronic devices, and Le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Paludisme (PNLP), which will be responsible for working with health centers to conduct PDMs. INSEED will monitor the PDM processes carried out by PNLP. _February 2020 update:_ PDMs began in May 2019, carried out by PNLP using electronic devices and independently monitored by INSEED.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how AMF’s operational process of engaging local partners and government officials in Togo secures local stakeholder support. By relying on in-country organizations and building the national Ministry of Health’s capacity for electronic data collection, AMF bolsters intervention buy-in and potentially reduces costs associated with external contracting, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After a review of overall net needs and through discussions with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (an expert on IR within Uganda and use of PBO nets), the Ugandan Ministry of Health has requested that the majority of the nets be PBO nets. Uganda demonstrates high rates of IR, and AMF does not believe that an alternative funder would be willing to procure PBO nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local stakeholder input—via the Ugandan Ministry of Health—guides intervention specifics (in this case, the type of net to be distributed). Incorporating local stakeholder requirements helps tailor the intervention to actual local needs, which can prevent misallocation of resources and thus contribute to making the charity more cost effective.

- **Quote:** When deciding which countries to target for future net distributions, AMF typically reviews existing malaria data briefly and has conversations with people from a number of organizations including the Alliance for Malaria Prevention, the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, and partners in-country who may have attended task force meetings and may know what the net gap is and to what extent funders are involved.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates AMF’s operational process of engaging a range of local stakeholders—including in-country partners and organizations—to gather reliable contextual information. Such engagement is a form of securing local buy-in, which can help ensure that interventions are better targeted and potentially more cost effective by allocating resources where they are most needed.

- **Quote:** AMF now posts pre-distribution registration survey operations plans on its website. This became formalized as part of the effort to increase efficiency during the busy period about 9 months ago. This will be part of the typical documentation for distributions in the future, except in cases where it creates an unnecessary burden. AMF is willing to be flexible, but hopes that the partner finds this to be a helpful way of communicating and summarizing plans.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights an operational process that emphasizes transparent communication and flexibility with local partners. By publicly sharing detailed operational plans, AMF fosters local stakeholder support and buy-in, which can contribute to smoother, more efficient interventions—key elements in enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF would like the Malaria Unit to work more closely with local health centers in all 4 districts to improve case rate data and extend coverage levels across a 3-year period.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows AMF’s strategy to integrate local health centers—important local stakeholders—into its intervention framework. By involving these local actors in data collection and ongoing monitoring, the charity aims to align its efforts more closely with local conditions, thus promoting operational efficiency and potentially reducing costs.

- **Quote:** The verification process involves collecting data electronically, printing out lists to show to community leaders, making annotations on the printed lists, using these annotated lists to verify data in villages, and then using smartphones during distributions to record what is distributed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that actively incorporates community leaders in critical verification steps. Involving local stakeholders in data verification helps ensure accuracy and reduces errors, which can prevent resource wastage and contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s intervention.

- **Quote:** In February 2013 AMF was approached by a potential distribution partner and the NMCP to ask if AMF was in a position to immediately fund 300,000 LLINs. The request was to fund the cost of nets as all non-net costs were already covered.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that local stakeholder support was expected to cover non-net costs, thereby enabling AMF to focus its spending solely on nets. This segregation of funding responsibilities is an operational process that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After seven weeks (to early July 2013), the NMCP communicated they were not being given permission by another partner to use funds previously approved to be used for non-nets costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a breakdown in local stakeholder commitment, illustrating how inadequate local buy-in can jeopardize funding arrangements and potentially compromise the cost effectiveness of an intervention.

- **Quote:** If the country were to want to re-open discussions, AMF would be willing to do so but would seek in writing a clear understanding of the project and the commitments of each party involved.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores the need for formal, written commitments from local stakeholders. Such operational processes help clarify responsibilities and financial contributions, reducing the risk of unexpected costs and thereby supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF plans to fund future LLIN distributions (including funding non-net costs) in the three districts in Malawi that it has worked in previously (Ntcheu, Balaka, and Dedza), and one additional district, in partnership with Concern Universal.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF is leveraging established local partnerships to secure buy-in and shared responsibility for non-net costs, an operational strategy that can lower overall costs and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how local partners like Concern Universal contribute operational rigor in ensuring data quality. Reliable data minimizes errors and unexpected expenses, thus playing a role in making the charity’s intervention more cost effective.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-28-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF learns about net gaps and receives funding requests through its network in the malaria control community, particularly through the Alliance for Malaria Prevention and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that AMF relies on established networks within the malaria control community, which likely includes local stakeholders, to identify net gaps. While it doesn't explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, leveraging local networks can lead to better-targeted interventions, a key factor in reducing wastage and enhancing overall cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** As its funding increases, AMF aims to make more strategic investments by engaging in the planning cycles of countries where it has strong connections and experience.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that AMF intentionally engages in country-level planning cycles—a process that implies securing local buy-in and stakeholder support. Although the direct link to cost-effectiveness isn't spelled out, such strategic alignment with local planning can ensure that interventions are better tailored to local needs and contexts, thereby potentially improving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF typically finds that the first time a country implements an intervention, there are many difficulties and a large amount of work is required. But the next time, because the infrastructure is in place and the partners have experience, the intervention is easier to implement and more effective. This makes it worthwhile to stay with a country while the processes become embedded. In countries it has previously supported, AMF has significantly improved accountability, data collection, and monitoring.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how embedding operational processes and maintaining long-term local partnerships improves implementation efficiency. The established infrastructure and experienced local partners lead to smoother interventions, suggesting that securing local stakeholder buy-in contributes to lower operational challenges and increased cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** If AMF went in and out of countries, that would make it difficult for countries to plan for the long term, and it would diminish AMF's impact due to the factors mentioned above. In addition, stepping away from ongoing projects would be detrimental to AMF's reputation as a steadfast partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the importance of consistency in partnership, highlighting that stable, enduring local stakeholder support facilitates better long-term planning and reduces operational disruptions. Such dependability is critical for cost-effectiveness, as it minimizes inefficiencies and builds trust with local stakeholders.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** Once AMF has identified funding gaps, it begins discussions with in-country partners, typically starting with the country's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), to learn about the country's needs, when it is doing distribution, and how it plans to approach distribution. AMF then drafts an agreement for the NMCP, which typically includes the specifics of AMF's approach to operations, data collection, and accountability. AMF then moves forward based on which countries move quickly and are able to agree to AMF's requirements (see below).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how AMF engages local stakeholders (e.g. the NMCP) by establishing clear operational processes and agreement terms, thereby ensuring local buy-in. Such processes likely contribute to cost-effectiveness by only proceeding with countries that can meet strict accountability and operational standards, reducing the risk of inefficient resource use.

- **Quote:** Before funding nets in Nigeria, AMF would need to be confident that nets would be delivered accountably, reaching the target population as intended.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores that securing local stakeholder support through accountable delivery is a prerequisite for funding. By requiring local buy-in and adherence to established operational processes, AMF minimizes risks and potential waste, which indirectly contributes to making their interventions more cost effective.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** During household registration: the volunteer and HSA introduce themselves to the head of the household and explain why they are there. The HSA obtains permission to enter the household from the household head. (The difficulty of obtaining this permission varies based on the local culture. Local leaders can lend credibility to the HSA when asking for permission to enter a household.)
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how involving local stakeholders—through local leaders lending credibility—helps secure household buy-in during the registration process. Such local endorsement likely streamlines data collection and minimizes resistance, thereby reducing operational inefficiencies and contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal staff then meet with traditional authorities and district health officials to explain the distribution plan and set a date for the distribution, avoiding days that conflict with other community events. Concern Universal communicates the date, time, and place of distributions verbally to village leaders, who relay the information verbally to village members.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates that engaging local stakeholders such as traditional authorities, district health officials, and village leaders is a key operational process. By securing local buy-in and using established local communication channels, the charity can ensure smoother distribution logistics, which in turn helps to optimize costs and enhance overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** AMF's role in LLIN distributions is to:2

1. Identify countries with funding gaps for LLINs.
2. Identify distribution partners (in-country non-profit organizations or government agencies) to carry out LLIN distributions. AMF and its partners agree on expectations for the distribution, including who pays for costs other than the purchase price of LLINs (which are always covered by AMF), the process that will be used to carry out the distribution, and what information will be collected and shared with AMF.
3. Identify which net types to use based on malaria prevalence, insecticide resistance, and price data.3
4. Purchase LLINs and have them shipped to the distribution partners.
5. Work with distribution and independent monitoring partners to ensure that the agreed-upon process for the distribution is implemented, collect reports on the distribution, and conduct follow-up surveys. Distribution partners implement on-the-ground activities, including registering residents in targeted areas and distributing LLINs. Independent monitors funded by AMF monitor the registration and distribution processes and conduct follow-up surveys.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details AMF’s structured operational process for conducting net distributions, emphasizing the selection and agreement with local distribution partners such as in-country non-profits and government agencies. Such local stakeholder involvement is critical to tailoring the intervention to local needs and keeping operational costs low, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Registration: During the registration process, national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door in targeted areas to collect the information used to determine the number of LLINs to allocate to each household (e.g., the number of sleeping spaces and/or the number of household members), as well as the information used to identify the household for the distribution and post-distribution surveys (e.g., the name of the head of the household and/or household location).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the active engagement of local personnel in the critical data collection phase. By utilizing national health staff and local volunteers for door-to-door registration, AMF ensures local buy-in and leverages local knowledge, which can improve accuracy in targeting and reduce distribution costs, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF's distributions in Ghana in 2016 were planned by high-level staff from a government health agency and implemented by local government staff and volunteers; monitoring of the distribution was largely implemented by a Ghanaian non-profit organization.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the practical involvement of local stakeholders in multiple stages of the intervention—from planning and implementation to monitoring. The reliance on local government and non-profit organizations not only promotes community buy-in but also likely reduces overhead and improves efficiency, thereby making the charity’s operations more cost effective.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** CU believes in tackling multiple problems in one place and aiming to make its work community-driven. They also believe in working closely with the District Council on all interventions as the most sustainable means of building service delivery capacity so that local government is able to identify and respond to community needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that CU’s operational process includes engaging local government (a key local stakeholder) to build long-term service delivery capacity. By involving the District Council, they foster local buy-in and sustainability, which is a mechanism through which cost effectiveness may be achieved by leveraging existing infrastructure and reducing redundant overhead costs.

- **Quote:** CU generally wouldn't do a one off project like what they are going to do with the net distribution and are carrying one out this time because of the length of time with which they have worked with Ntcheu District Council and its relevance to their objective of building District capacity on service delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that CU intentionally integrates its interventions with ongoing relationships with local authorities rather than pursuing ad hoc projects. Such sustained local stakeholder engagement supports efficient use of resources and can lead to enhanced cost effectiveness by embedding projects in pre-existing local structures.

- **Quote:** For the distribution, they have determined that it's important to rely on existing infrastructure such as a Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), government health workers who each cover a few villages.
- **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates an operational process that secures local stakeholder support by using established local health networks. By leveraging the existing capacities of HSAs and government health workers, CU minimizes the need for additional external resources, which contributes to lower operational costs and improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 2011.md
- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program stated that the Ministry of Health fully supports the Concern Universal distribution in Ntcheu.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows that a key local stakeholder (the Ministry of Health) is endorsing the intervention, representing local buy-in. Such support can enable smoother implementation and potentially reduce extra costs related to coordination or conflict.

- **Quote:** Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the operational process of sustained coordination with district officials, ensuring that local stakeholders are actively involved. Involving these stakeholders can help streamline operations and prevent issues that might otherwise drive up costs, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HSAs should not distribute LLINs alone - an HSA Supervisor and village headman/headwoman should be present for any distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This recommendation underscores the inclusion of local figures in the distribution process, ensuring community-level oversight. Such engagement secures local stakeholder support and accountability, which can enhance efficiency and reduce potential wastage or errors, factors that can improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program asked whether Concern could delay their HSA training so that someone representing the district could be present.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that local stakeholders are actively seeking involvement in key operational steps (like training), ensuring that local perspectives and oversight are integrated. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, such integration is likely to optimize resource use and improve the intervention’s efficiency.

## Code: Training local workforce: Improving the skills of the workforce employed by the charity’s local partners.
### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal staff and district health officials supervise the HSAs to ensure that they are doing their jobs correctly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where direct supervision functions as an on‐the‐job quality check. While it doesn’t explicitly detail formal training, such oversight helps maintain and improve the workforce’s performance, which can reduce errors and inefficiencies—a practice that likely contributes indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal has been employing the same 10-20 enumerators to do surveys every six months for the last few years. The enumerators are now experienced and capable of making good judgment calls regarding whether nets are used or not.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how repeated engagement in survey operations results in increased experience and improved decision-making skills. Though not explicitly linked to cost effectiveness in the text, the enhanced ability to accurately assess net usage through improved judgment is a form of skill development that can help in optimizing resource allocation and thereby contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** While visiting the Northern Region distribution, Mr. Walsh observed that there was a lack of good documentation on the number of nets removed from one location for transport and the number of nets arriving at the other end. He addressed this with the NMCP, which acted quickly to fix the problem through retraining.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where identified gaps in documentation were corrected through targeted retraining of local staff. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, improving documentation and process accuracy through retraining helps reduce errors and inefficiencies, which can indirectly contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Step 4 - Training of district supervisors and GHS volunteers: Orientation attendees then pass on this training to supervisors and volunteers in their district; this cascades down until all volunteers are trained.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes a structured, cascading training process that ensures local workforce members are properly trained on their roles. Enhancing the skills of district supervisors and volunteers through systematic training is an operational process that likely minimizes mistakes and improves efficiency, thus supporting cost effectiveness in the program.

- **Quote:** ADDRO will recruit and train volunteers to conduct monthly household visits to provide additional malaria prevention education, including how to care for the nets, and quarterly visits to ensure that nets are properly installed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates another instance where training is used to build capacity among local partners’ staff and volunteers. By equipping them with the necessary skills for follow-up and education, the program promotes correct net usage and maintenance, which can extend the nets’ lifespan and reduce future replacement costs, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** This will result in missed PDM activities (the first round of data collection is scheduled for March of 2019), although AMF believes this loss is outweighed by the opportunity to build the national Ministry of Health's capacity for large-scale electronic data collection.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational decision where short-term activity losses are accepted in order to invest in capacity building. Building local capacity, akin to training the workforce, can lead to improved skills and long-term cost effectiveness through more efficient data collection processes.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** After nets have been obtained, it takes several months to put in place all the logistics and in-country planning that go into carrying out a multimillion-net campaign, including:

* Managing the health team
* Registering households
* Training
* Producing vouchers
* Deciding on database technology
* Preparing for electronic device data collection
* Running a small-scale pilot
- **Reasoning:** This quote lists key operational activities required for a multimillion-net campaign and explicitly includes 'Training' as an essential component. It implies that allocating sufficient time and resources to training local partners is part of the planned process, which, when executed properly, can contribute to overall cost effectiveness by ensuring efficient implementation.

- **Quote:** AMF typically finds that the first time a country implements an intervention, there are many difficulties and a large amount of work is required. But the next time, because the infrastructure is in place and the partners have experience, the intervention is easier to implement and more effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the value of accumulated experience and capacity building—likely stemming in part from effective training. The improved efficiency and ease of implementation on subsequent interventions suggest that investing in training and developing the skills of local partner workforces can lead to more cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** We took a about 30 minute drive over bumpy roads to a health center at which an HSA training took place. This was the training for collecting data on who had/needed nets, the same sort of data that had been used on the previous day in the village registration meeting. The meeting lasted about 2 hours; it was in another language, and we sat next to someone who translated some but not all of what was said. There were about 20 HSAs present. This was the training for one of the ~20 clusters; 7 villages are in this cluster. Each HSA is to have 4 days per village to collect data: 3 to go door to door and one to check/consolidate/clean up. They explained how to recognize a usable net (it has to be an LLIN and there are rules about how many holes are OK). They said they would be checking the data sheet with the village leader as well as reading it to the whole village, so HSAs shouldn't be corrupt: they need to get the right data. Each of the ~5 CU employees spoke at length. There was a jovial exchange along the lines of "what about when a wife and husband are sleeping separately?" The answer was that they each get a net. There was a question about people who follow a religion that says not to use nets. The answer was that if people don't want nets they shouldn't be registered for them. One HSA asked whether he should register himself, since he doesn't have a net. They said yes, but only on one village register. There was concern about the issue of "what if not everybody gets a net?" The answer was that it's a universal coverage campaign: everyone gets their nets. An HSA said that some people use the nets to kill birds, and CU said HSAs should tell people not to do this, that it's dangerous to eat birds that have been killed with nets because of the insecticide.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed account of the HSA training session shows how CU invests in building the local workforce's skills in accurate data collection, quality assurance, and operational transparency. Improved competency in these areas can lead to more efficient resource allocation and reduced errors in net distribution, indirectly enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Village WASH committees are taught basic borehole maintenance and local mechanics are taught more advanced maintenance. The committees are trained by HSAs, who are trained by CU staff.
- **Reasoning:** This quote exemplifies a cascade training approach that builds local capacity for maintaining vital infrastructure. By empowering local partners with technical skills, CU promotes self-sufficiency in maintenance tasks, potentially lowering the need for expensive external expertise and thus contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

## Code: Intra-intervention monitoring: Monitoring the charity’s intervention during its implementation.
### Doc Name: Cost-effectiveness.md
- **Quote:** Third, we place great emphasis on the preparation, carrying out and follow up of distributions to ensure the potential impact of distributing nets is realised. We report on this transparently and in detail.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the charity's commitment to monitoring its intervention by emphasizing each phase of the process—preparation, implementation (carrying out), and follow-up—to ensure the effectiveness of net distributions. This monitoring process is crucial for achieving cost-effectiveness, as it ensures that every stage is managed properly to maximize health impact per dollar donated.

- **Quote:** The independent charity evaluator GiveWell provide a quantitative estimate of the cost per life saved for AMF distributed nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity incorporates external monitoring and evaluation through GiveWell’s quantitative estimates, which helps validate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The use of measurable outcomes reinforces how monitoring the intervention contributes to efficient operational processes.

### Doc Name: What we do.md
- **Quote:** We monitor net usage to ensure nets continue to be used.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that ongoing monitoring is implemented during the intervention to verify that the nets, which are central to the charity’s work, continue to be actively used. This continuous evaluation is crucial for ensuring that resources are effectively utilized, thereby supporting cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** Monthly malaria case rate data is gathered from all health centres in a distribution zone. This information helps show net impact and determine where additional community-led malaria education activities and net hang-up campaigns are appropriate.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that data collected during implementation informs decision-making regarding additional interventions. By identifying areas where further operational activities are needed, the charity can optimize resource allocation and operational processes to be more cost-effective.

### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** Independent supervision at the 'moment of distribution' ensures the 'no show, no net' rule is followed and helps avoid nets being misappropriated.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a real-time monitoring mechanism during the intervention. The independent supervision actively ensures rules are adhered to, preventing misappropriation and contributing to cost-effective operations by reducing waste and ensuring proper allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Detailed beneficiary lists are screened for 'ghost names' by being read out in public by community leaders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an additional monitoring step during the implementation process, where public verification of beneficiary lists helps ensure that only valid recipients receive the nets. This process supports cost-effectiveness by avoiding errors and fraud that could lead to resource wastage.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** Participation may include carrying out PDCUs, other monitoring activities during the pre-distribution or distribution phase, or taking a significant management, planning or operational role in the distribution itself.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that monitoring is an integral part of the intervention process during implementation. It indicates that distribution partners may be involved in monitoring activities, which, by ensuring proper oversight, can help streamline operations and potentially reduce wasted resources, contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** the distribution of nets including: malaria education delivery; signed lists showing beneficiaries who have received nets; photos and video footage of the distribution; and an immediate Post-Distribution Report (PRR) reporting to AMF on key aspects and numbers for the distribution
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes a detailed monitoring mechanism during the implementation phase. The immediate Post-Distribution Report (PRR) and the collection of visual and documented evidence ensure that the distribution process is closely tracked, thereby facilitating rapid adjustments and efficient resource use, both of which are essential for cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** post-distribution activity that includes an assessment of the hang-up rate of nets which triggers additional intervention if necessary, as well as longer term post distribution check-ups (PDCUs) that take place via household visits, typically every 6 months post-distribution of the nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that monitoring extends into the post-distribution phase. Evaluating the hang-up rate and conducting regular follow-up visits allow the charity to verify whether the nets are effectively put to use, enabling timely corrective measures. This approach helps prevent inefficiencies and supports cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: Allocating donations.md
- **Quote:** In an ideal cycle nets would be distributed, monitored, and replacement nets funded as soon as the need becomes evident.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly mentions 'monitored' as a critical step in the intervention cycle, highlighting that ongoing oversight is intended to trigger timely funding for replacement nets. This suggests that by tracking net performance and needs during implementation, the charity can reallocate funds as required in a cost-effective manner, aligning expenditures with actual need.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** Individuals not connected with the communities receiving nets or the government health teams involved in the distribution, are present whenever a net is handed out. They check the beneficiary is identified on the net distribution list and the 'no show, no net' rule is applied. Why? This ensures nets reach those who need them and reduces to an immaterial level the misappropriation of nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates a monitoring process during the intervention – independent supervision during net distribution – which helps ensure that nets are properly allocated and misappropriation is minimized, thereby contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** Post-distribution surveys (PDSs) are carried out at six-month intervals. Approximately 5% of the nets distributed are assessed through visits to randomly selected households. The data are published. Why? Only by gathering data do we have a strong idea of the level of net use and condition. The data can alert the distribution partner to the need for additional actions such as a net hang-up campaign or an additional malaria education intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence that monitoring, through regular post-distribution surveys, is integral to the intervention. By identifying issues such as low net use or poor net condition, the charity can take corrective actions, which enhances the cost-effectiveness of their operational processes.

- **Quote:** Monthly malaria data is gathered from all health centres in the distribution zone. The level of stock of rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) kits is monitored. Why? This allows us to assess the impact of the nets and be alerted to any trends that might suggest additional actions are necessary such as a net
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an ongoing monitoring mechanism – by collecting monthly malaria data and tracking RDT kits – which aids in assessing the intervention's impact and facilitates timely operational adjustments. This continuous monitoring supports cost-effective decision-making during the implementation of the charity’s intervention.

### Doc Name: Information we publish.md
- **Quote:** We may also receive single page weekly reports during the distribution, summarising progress.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that during the intervention the charity collects weekly progress reports, a monitoring tool that helps identify issues, solutions, and lessons learned in real time. While it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, the continuous feedback mechanism implies an operational framework that can lead to more efficient, and thus potentially cost-effective, processes.

- **Quote:** Distribution partners are required to provide a minimum number of photos and minutes of video footage taken during the distribution. This acts as an element of verification for us, as well as being of wider interest to donors and others, to see what went on during the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote presents a second form of monitoring during the intervention through visual documentation, ensuring that the implementation is transparent and verifiable. Such evidence can be used to assess and optimize operational procedures, indirectly supporting efforts to maintain cost-effective processes.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 2013 08 15 (public).md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducted an audit of the malaria case rate data measuring malaria rates in the regions served by AMF's distribution there (more on this data at http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf/updates/February-2013#Additionalmalariacaseratedata).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that a monitoring process—via an audit of intervention outcomes—is in place. While it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, it suggests that tracking the accuracy and reliability of outcome data (e.g., reductions in malaria cases) is a tool used by AMF to inform potential adjustments, which can contribute to more cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** AMF has requested additional data from local health centers and is in the process of reviewing it.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that AMF is actively monitoring its intervention during or after implementation by collecting further data. Such ongoing monitoring can help identify operational issues and guide adjustments to improve the efficiency and cost–effectiveness of its processes, although the direct linkage to cost savings is implied rather than explicitly stated.

### Doc Name: Don de Savigny 10-22-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's model requests two types of information. First, it requests 'distribution verification' information. This allows reassurance, to donors and others, that nets are distributed as intended and not diverted. There are some concerns in the malaria control community regarding the level of distribution verification reporting and the public availability of this information.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates the monitoring process during implementation—specifically the collection of distribution verification data—to ensure that nets reach their intended recipients and are not diverted. This monitoring supports cost-effective operational processes by providing assurance that resources are properly utilized and by minimizing potential wastage.

- **Quote:** AMF has had success in Malawi, at the 250,000 net level, collecting six-monthly post-distribution net use and check-up information, sampling 5% of households receiving nets. The results are impressive.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of implemented monitoring during the intervention. The regular post-distribution check-ups not only verify that nets are continuously used but also serve as a feedback mechanism to enhance efficiency. This systematic monitoring contributes to cost-effectiveness by ensuring that the intervention's impact is maintained over time.

- **Quote:** AMF should continue to make it clear that it is flexible and ready to consider contributing to the costs of extra data collection if necessary to meet its accountability obligations in its new funding model. It did this in Sierra Leone with a contribution, in effect, of $1.3m of funding for data-related costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that AMF integrates monitoring into its operational budget, investing directly in data collection during implementation. By shouldering data-related costs when needed, AMF enhances accountability and ensures the efficient use of resources, which is a key element in fostering cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_6-30-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** For example, AMF's representative in Uganda, David Masiko, did not find any irregularities when he spot-checked the data; and figures from the official 2014 census are known to have significantly underestimated the population.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a direct monitoring activity during the intervention — the use of spot-checks to verify data accuracy — which helps ensure that the distribution adheres to expectations. Such oversight can prevent misallocation of resources and contribute to cost-effective operational processes by confirming that the intervention is implemented as planned.

- **Quote:** AMF and other funders are considering an independent audit. This will include an examination of the existing data for signs of fraud, and visits to 20 randomly-selected villages: 10 in the Eastern Region and 10 in the Western Region. In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed passage describes a comprehensive monitoring process being implemented during the intervention, including independent audits and re-registration of households. By rigorously verifying data and preventing potential fraud or errors, such monitoring measures improve the reliability of operational decisions, thereby supporting cost-effective processes.

- **Quote:** Post-distribution surveys ask whether nets are used correctly, with responses being Yes or No. Surveyors ask respondents to demonstrate how they use the nets. If nets are tucked under mattresses with no spaces for mosquitos to get in and there are not large holes (small holes are ok due to presence of insecticide), then the net is considered 'used correctly.' Surveyors assume that all nets in the household are used in the same way the one for which use was demonstrated is--they don't ask respondents to demonstrate multiple nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF monitors the actual use of nets during implementation. By verifying that nets are used correctly, the charity ensures that resources are effectively utilized, which is a key element for maintaining cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** AMF is starting to rate partners on "Efficient and easy to work with?" "Did what they said they would do?" and "Timely provision of reports, photos, video." AMF seeks to be as quantitative and transparent as possible with these ratings and uses a series of checklists and time-stamped documents to make the ratings.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a systematic monitoring approach where partner performance is evaluated based on efficiency, reliability, and quantitative measures. Such monitoring helps ensure that operations remain streamlined and cost-effective by holding partners accountable during implementation.

- **Quote:** AMF does not have a systematic way to conduct spot checks of data quality, but has worked with volunteers from PricewaterhouseCoopers to do a few checks. In one case in Malawi, AMF was concerned about the delays in receiving data and asked a local hospital director to check things out. She went with three staff and confirmed that the data was accurate.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of ad hoc monitoring to verify data quality. By ensuring that data is accurate through spot checks, AMF safeguards the integrity of its operational processes, which is essential for cost-effective decision-making during the intervention.

- **Quote:** AMF said, "Now we need to make sure we convert the funding into success and feed data back to funders to demonstrate to people that it continues to be a good investment."
- **Reasoning:** This quote links monitoring efforts directly to accountability and demonstrating success to funders. By feeding back data that shows the intervention’s effectiveness, AMF supports the argument that its operational processes are cost-effective, thereby reinforcing donor confidence and efficient use of funds.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** The logistics, monitoring, and operational teams of Ghana's NMCP will be on the ground in all 3 districts, liaising with local health systems to manage and supervise distributions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that during the intervention, active monitoring is embedded in the process by deploying dedicated teams on the ground. Their direct liaison with local health systems ensures that the distribution is well-managed, which implies that such monitoring contributes to operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Before the entire data collection process starts, both sets of data collectors are made aware of the 5% checking process and AMF reports that this motivates the first wave of data collectors to do high-quality work.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a monitoring mechanism within the implementation phase where a 5% verification check incentivizes high-quality data collection. By promoting accuracy and reducing errors or fraud, the process helps ensure that resources are used efficiently, thereby contributing to cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** The process once uncovered an issue where a data collector doubled the number of requested nets for his relatives and removed the equivalent number of nets from another village. The data collector was identified through his unique log-in and was immediately dismissed by AMF's distribution partner. The distribution partner reported the incident to AMF in their weekly report. After this incident, policy was changed so that data entry clerks do not work on data covering their own or nearby villages.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides a concrete example of how ongoing monitoring during the intervention not only detects irregularities but also leads to prompt corrective actions and policy changes. Such vigilance prevents resource misallocation and reinforces operational cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** After the HSAs have collected data from all villages, spot-checkers independently collect the same data from 5% of households in each village. The spot-checkers are employed by the government and receive lunch allowances paid by Concern Universal during the time they are engaged in the exercise. This data is later compared to the HSA data to check for consistency. The two sets of data are entered into a Microsoft Access database separately. Reconciliation of the data is done after data entry. The data is used to calculate the number of nets required in each village, health center catchment area, and district.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a clear monitoring process during the intervention: independent spot-checkers verify the data collected by HSAs. By ensuring consistency and accuracy in the data used to calculate net requirements, this monitoring mechanism helps prevent misallocation of resources and thus contributes to operations that are more cost-effective.

- **Quote:** Procedures are generally the same across districts, but procedural improvements (e.g. 105% verification or new accountability measures) are often trialed in one area and expanded to all 4 districts if they are successful.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity actively monitors and evaluates its processes by trialing new accountability and verification measures. The ability to identify and standardize improvements across districts supports operational efficiency, which is a key element in achieving cost-effective processes.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md
- **Quote:** I spoke with Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky in September last year (2010) and described the Post-Distribution Surveys (PDSs) we were now including as a mandatory element of all distributions for which we fund nets. These surveys, conducted 6, 18, 30 and 42 months post-distribution, allow an assessment of net usage levels and net condition.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a formal monitoring mechanism (PDSs) used by the charity to continuously assess the state and usage of nets after distribution. By collecting actionable data through these surveys, the organization can adjust and refine its processes, supporting cost-effective operations by ensuring resources are used efficiently over the intervention's lifecycle.

- **Quote:** Second, it is sensible for us to consider the performance of a distribution partner in our assessment of for whom we fund nets. We have many times more requests for nets than we can fulfill (we could fund an additional $10 million in proposals right away if we had the money) and whilst criteria for assessing a distribution proposal will always include the area being badly affected by malaria, our confidence in how a distribution partner will manage pre, during and post-distribution activities is relevant. We want to make sure we are only working with the best organizations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of monitoring not just after, but during the overall intervention process (pre, during and post-distribution). By evaluating distribution partner performance through active monitoring, the charity ensures that only the most effective and reliable organizations receive funding, thereby optimizing resource allocation and contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF integrates monitoring into its intervention by using data collection and verification. By observing how different districts implement the distribution, AMF can gather valuable insights for refining its processes, which in turn can contribute to more cost-effective operational decisions.

- **Quote:** The three-year program that AMF is currently negotiating with Country A would distribute 2.2 million nets in the first year, 1.8 million in the second year, and 1.5 million in the third year. This schedule will give AMF an opportunity to assist with closing the gap, as well as learn from its experience working with partners in Country A.
- **Reasoning:** This quote implies that by staggering net distributions over multiple years, AMF builds in opportunities to monitor and evaluate its intervention. The phased approach allows the organization to learn from each stage of implementation and adjust its strategy, which is indicative of an effort to achieve cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final-1 2011.md
- **Quote:** there's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a monitoring mechanism implemented during the intervention—ensuring data on net needs is verified—which is fundamental to avoiding resource misallocation. By accurately assessing need in real time, the process can prevent oversupply or undersupply, thereby supporting cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program made several suggestions for the Ntcheu distribution by Concern: HSAs should not distribute LLINs alone - an HSA Supervisor and village headman/headwoman should be present for any distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This recommendation underscores the importance of supervisory oversight during the intervention’s implementation. Involving supervisors and local leaders acts as a form of monitoring that can reduce errors and inefficiencies, which in turn contributes to more cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that external monitoring through district-level coordination is integrated into the intervention. Continuous oversight by district officials helps ensure that the charity’s activities are aligned with local needs and standards, which is a key factor in achieving operational cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** His role has been to assess potential NGO partners, participate in the planning process, meet with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), and help with course corrections (for example, when it was realized that there was no plan for transporting registration coupon books to the data entry center).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that monitoring, through ongoing oversight and course corrections during implementation, helps identify and remedy process gaps (such as the missing transport plan) that could otherwise lead to inefficiencies or increased costs.

- **Quote:** Instead, Episcopal Relief & Development and ADDRO carried out 'light monitoring,' and considered themselves 'embedded' in the pre-distribution and distribution work. Monitoring activities included: Attending meetings, including planning meetings at the national level, as well as a sample of district meetings and training sessions. This was done to observe whether activities were proceeding according to the NMCP's checklist and, if there were issues, to follow up with the NMCP.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly details how on-the-ground monitoring is integrated throughout the intervention, ensuring that implementation adheres to established protocols and enabling prompt follow-up when issues arise. Such active monitoring can help reduce costly errors and enhance operational efficiency.

- **Quote:** Monitors also observed the work of multiple community-based agents (CBAs); sometimes, they would do a cross-check by performing this task without the supervisor. They listened to the CBA's conversations with households, verified that the correct information had been recorded in the book, and addressed any issues with the CBA. They then went back through the route traveled by the CBA to ensure that households that should have been registered were registered, and that the coupons had been correctly filled out.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides a concrete example of monitoring during implementation, where field quality assurance measures (verifying data and registration processes) help ensure accurate and efficient operations. By catching discrepancies at the source, such monitoring likely contributes to a reduction in unnecessary costs associated with errors or miscommunication.

### Doc Name: NMCP_Ghana_08-16-16_to_08-18-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** During negotiations, AMF requested household tracing, which requires tracking the nets in order to ensure they reach their intended recipients. The Global Fund also recently made this requirement. This can be a fairly challenging task, but it is not unreasonable since different funders (AMF and the Global Fund) are requesting the same monitoring data. When different funders have different requirements and request different types of monitoring data, however, it can be overly burdensome.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly describes a monitoring activity (household tracing) implemented during the intervention to ensure nets reach the intended recipients. Although it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, ensuring proper delivery through monitoring implies reducing waste and enhancing operational efficiency.

- **Quote:** In future distributions, the NMCP would like to apply a batch number to the nets in each bale in order to more efficiently track whether they reached the intended destination (e.g. the NMCP would know that nets labeled 'Batch #0210' were intended for a specific district; if the nets ended up somewhere else, something went wrong).
- **Reasoning:** This quote presents an example of a proposed monitoring improvement—using batch numbers to track net distribution. The emphasis on tracking 'more efficiently' suggests that such monitoring measures can streamline operations and contribute to cost-effective processes by identifying and addressing distribution errors early.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** In Zambia, AMF will now be conducting PDMs at nine-month intervals with a 1.5% sample size, rather than at six-month intervals with a 5% sample size.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a deliberate adjustment to the monitoring process during implementation, likely aimed at reducing costs (by decreasing frequency and sample size) while still ensuring adequate oversight, thereby contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** AMF found it highly difficult to identify a low-cost partner for PDMs in Togo. Simultaneously, it decided to pursue a strategy of fully electronic data collection. This will result in missed PDM activities (the first round of data collection is scheduled for March of 2019), although AMF believes this loss is outweighed by the opportunity to build the national Ministry of Health's capacity for large-scale electronic data collection.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how monitoring is adapted in response to cost constraints. The decision to switch to electronic data collection—despite causing missed PDM rounds—reflects a strategic trade-off that enhances long-term operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The first PDM for the major distribution of nets to PNG in 2017 was missed, but an 18-month and potentially a 27-month PDM will be conducted. AMF believes that skipping the first PDM was justified because the alternative would have been to partner with a different organization and incur significantly higher costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that AMF’s monitoring decisions during implementation are influenced by cost considerations. By opting out of an early PDM to avoid higher costs associated with an alternative partner, AMF demonstrates how monitoring choices can directly contribute to maintaining cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_9-9-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's agreements with its distribution partners typically state that PDCUs should be conducted 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after distribution, with a grace period of 1 month to allow for unforeseen delays. Causes of delays can include conflict over resources and weather. The first PDCU in Kasai Occidental was conducted 8 months after distribution rather than 6, due to an in-country resourcing problem. Part of AMF's work involves helping its partners to learn from their mistakes, and moderate delays are acceptable. When a PDCU is delayed by about a month, the schedule for the following PDCUs typically does not change. If a PDCU is delayed significantly (e.g. by 3 months), it may be necessary to cancel the next one scheduled, but AMF works hard to ensure that this does not happen.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF monitors the rollout of its intervention through scheduled post-distribution check-ups (PDCUs). By tracking implementation progress and identifying delays, AMF can adjust its operations, thereby reducing inefficiencies and contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** When AMF began working with a new partner in DRC, there were some inefficiencies in the reporting process, and AMF created a series of templates to simplify the process and reduce the amount of work necessary for both AMF and the partner. AMF also leveraged technology to reduce its workload in reporting to various authorities. These two changes have reduced the amount of time spent on financial reporting by a factor of 5-10. These new systems have also enabled AMF to have current financial information available on its website.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that through monitoring its internal processes—by identifying and addressing reporting inefficiencies—AMF was able to streamline operations, significantly reduce labor (and likely cost) in financial reporting, and ensure that up-to-date information is available. This directly supports the idea that monitoring leads to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** Smartphones will be used in Nord-Ubangi for pre-distribution registration surveys, distributions, data collection, and some parts of verification. The verification process involves collecting data electronically, printing out lists to show to community leaders, making annotations on the printed lists, using these annotated lists to verify data in villages, and then using smartphones during distributions to record what is distributed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the integration of technology as a monitoring tool during the intervention. By employing smartphones to collect and verify data in real time, AMF enhances the accuracy and efficiency of its operations, which in turn contributes to cost-effective implementation.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 5-23-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** In discussions over several weeks, distribution verification information and post-distribution check-up activity were agreed to and AMF committed to funding 300,000 LLINs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that monitoring processes—specifically, distribution verification and post-distribution check-ups—were intentionally built into the intervention during implementation. Such monitoring can help ensure that the processes are on track and, by identifying issues early, contribute to operational efficiency and potential cost savings.

- **Quote:** CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides an example of effective monitoring during implementation through rigorous data checking. By promptly addressing data errors and inaccuracies, the intervention is better positioned to avoid hidden problems, which in turn supports more cost–effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF funds an independent organization to have someone sit in on meetings of the national malaria control program (NMCP) and report to AMF on progress, meetings, plans, resources, and gaps. AMF later funds an independent organization to go into the field and observe the government's registration process. AMF randomly selects villages for the independent organization to visit, and the organization assesses to what extent registration is happening properly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF incorporates monitoring into its implementation phase by having independent observers assess operational readiness and data collection processes. By identifying gaps and ensuring that procedures are followed, AMF can address issues proactively, which contributes to cost-effective operational processes by reducing the likelihood of wasted resources or inefficient practices.

- **Quote:** Direct entry of household data collected on paper into an AMF-managed database via a data entry center funded by AMF and managed by a sub-contractor reporting directly to AMF ensured that AMF would receive as accurate as possible a record of the registration data collected.
Accurate registration and distribution data, in electronic form, is key to both a) funding the right number of nets to ensure universal net coverage (without gaps and without wastage), and b) understanding the success, or otherwise, of a distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how robust monitoring and data collection during implementation—through the use of a dedicated data entry system—directly supports cost-effectiveness. By ensuring that data is accurate and immediately available, AMF can fund the correct quantity of nets and optimize distribution, thereby minimizing wastage and improving overall operational efficiency.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** GiveWell spoke with Mr. Mather of AMF to learn more about how AMF prioritizes distributions to fund, its efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation by its distribution partners, and the rationale for AMF's work in Papua New Guinea.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly references AMF's efforts to improve monitoring and evaluation, indicating that they focus on overseeing their interventions. It implies that such oversight is integral during implementation to ensure accountability and efficiency, which can lead to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** For example, AMF requires household registration data that is collected on paper to be converted to electronic form at a data entry center. Previously, AMF had let each country decide how to handle data entry, but found that this resulted in countries using a wide range of different numbers of data entry centers, which sometimes created issues with inconsistent data entry practices, lack of internet access, bureaucratic complexity, etc. AMF learned that it is more effective for it to require that countries use a single data entry center.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF's monitoring of data collection practices during implementation revealed inefficiencies such as inconsistency and bureaucratic complexity. By standardizing to a single data entry center, AMF improved the operational process, which is a proxy for achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** Data validation: In Malawi, AMF's distribution partner Concern Universal provides registration lists to community leaders who read the lists out loud at a community meeting, supervised by Concern Universal, so community members can request edits.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a direct example of a monitoring activity implemented during the intervention. By having community members validate the registration data through a public review, the process helps to correct errors early, ensuring resources (like nets) are allocated properly and reducing potential waste—thereby contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** IMA has agreed there are benefits to conducting a separate, earlier pre-distribution phase during which accurate household-level net need is established. IMA are less able to estimate accurately population and net need in North Ubangi compared to what they felt was possible in West Kasai. IMA believes point distributions rather than at-household distribution will be more cost-effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how monitoring and the evaluation of operational approaches can lead to adjustments that enhance cost-effectiveness. By comparing different methods (at-household versus point distribution) and favoring the one that reduces costs, the intervention leverages monitoring insights to optimize operational processes.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** AMF conducts post-distribution surveys of completed distributions to determine whether LLINs have reached their intended destinations and how long they remain in good condition.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that monitoring is an integral part of the intervention, ensuring that distributed nets are effectively reaching their targets and maintained over time. By verifying operational outcomes in real time, such monitoring underpins the cost-effectiveness of the entire process.

- **Quote:** We incorporate our assessment of the quality of AMF's monitoring methodology into our cost-effectiveness model54 and into our qualitative assessment of AMF's organizational strength.
- **Reasoning:** This statement explicitly links the monitoring process with cost-effectiveness by showing that the charity uses the quality of its monitoring data to refine its cost-effectiveness models and overall operational evaluation, thereby directly contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

### Doc Name: Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** Each village was visited daily by a supervisor who checked the dilution of the permethrin and the progress of the installation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote exemplifies rigorous, day-to-day monitoring during implementation. By ensuring that technical details (like correct dilution of insecticide) and installation progress are continuously checked, such oversight minimizes errors and inefficiencies, thereby contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** After distribution, study staff went door-to-door to ensure that nets were hung properly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates follow-up monitoring immediately after the intervention. By verifying that nets are correctly installed in households, the process helps ensure that the distribution investment is fully effective and not wasted, which is key to achieving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** CU conducted a pre-distribution survey and has completed a 6-month follow up study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly indicates that Concern Universal is monitoring its intervention by collecting baseline and follow-up data. Such continuous monitoring allows the organization to assess the effectiveness of its net distribution, adjust estimates, and streamline resource allocation, thereby supporting cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** We asked CU whether they do any household-level checks of the data the HSAs report, i.e., sending CU staff directly to randomly chosen households to see whether the existing net coverage matches the data collected by HSAs. They said that checks are currently limited to village-level meetings, and that doing a household-level audit sounds like an idea worth considering.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that CU is actively examining its data collection methods during implementation. By considering more rigorous, household-level audits, the charity is exploring ways to enhance data accuracy and transparency, which are key to maintaining efficient and cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** For the new distribution, there's been an orientation for government leaders, and CU is scheduling meetings with HSAs. The project director meets with the national distribution committee weekly, and has been advocating an approach where data is collected pre-distribution on where ITNs are needed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the adoption of regular monitoring practices and data-driven decision-making. By holding weekly meetings and collecting pre-distribution data on net needs, CU is positioning itself to optimize its operations and avoid wastage, thereby contributing to cost-effectiveness during implementation.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a monitoring mechanism implemented during the intervention wherein HSAs collect and verify data on LLIN needs. By ensuring the accuracy of needs assessment, such monitoring measures may help prevent resource misallocation, which is a key component of cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** HSAs should not distribute LLINs alone - an HSA Supervisor and village headman/headwoman should be present for any distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the recommendation for supervisory oversight during distribution. The presence of both an HSA Supervisor and a community leader serves as a monitoring strategy that can minimize errors and inefficiencies, thereby contributing indirectly to cost-effective operations.

## Code: Imposing standards on local stakeholders: Imposing requirements on the stakeholders involved in the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: Cost-effectiveness.md
- **Quote:** Second, we have an operating model that has proved highly effective: a lean organisational structure, significant leveraging of technology and a pro bono partnership and distribution partner model. This means our costs are exceptionally low.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the charity's operating model, which includes partnering with distribution partners (likely local stakeholders) and leveraging technology—all of which contribute to lower operational costs. Although it does not explicitly mention imposed requirements, the structure implies that operational processes involving external partners support cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Third, we place great emphasis on the preparation, carrying out and follow up of distributions to ensure the potential impact of distributing nets is realised. We report on this transparently and in detail.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights detailed operational processes in the execution of net distributions. While it does not directly state that local stakeholders are subjected to specific requirements, the emphasis on rigorous preparation, implementation, and follow-up implies that such procedural standards—potentially involving local distribution partners—play a role in achieving cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Guiding principles.md
- **Quote:** Distribution partners pay for the costs of distributing the nets (with one exception currently). This means all donations from the public buy nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local distribution partners are required to cover distribution costs. Imposing this financial responsibility on local stakeholders ensures that all public donations are directed exclusively toward purchasing nets, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Detailed beneficiary lists are screened for 'ghost names' by being read out in public by community leaders.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates another operational process that imposes a requirement on local stakeholders—in this case, community leaders—to ensure transparency and prevent fraud. By holding local stakeholders accountable through public screening of beneficiary lists, the charity minimizes wastage and misappropriation, contributing to overall cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Our Process.md
- **Quote:** This process is a little modified from that followed in prior years due to an initial focus now on discussions with National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) and other organisations to establish net need and attitude to accountability, which precede discussions with in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the initial operational step where AMF engages with local and national stakeholders (such as NMCPs) to verify net need and set accountability standards. By establishing these requirements upfront, AMF ensures that subsequent actions are need-based and transparent, a critical component in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF identifies and approaches organisations, potential distribution partners, that may have the resources and necessary experience in-country to participate in a net distribution. Participation may include carrying out PDCUs, other monitoring activities during the pre-distribution or distribution phase, or taking a significant management, planning or operational role in the distribution itself.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that AMF imposes specific criteria on local stakeholders by requiring that distribution partners have the expertise and capacity to manage various aspects of the operation. Leveraging local expertise in this way likely minimizes operational redundancies and overhead, thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The NNCP/distribution partner then carries out the distribution of nets, including a number of required components that are part of the overall service delivery as follows: a) pre-distribution activity in the area to receive nets to establish: a list of beneficiaries, specifically the net need per individual household; full cooperation and involvement of local community leaders and health officers; a plan for the receipt, transport, distribution, malaria-education, delivery to all beneficiaries, hanging and post-distribution follow up of the nets b) the distribution of nets including: malaria education delivery; signed lists showing beneficiaries who have received nets; photos and video footage of the distribution; and an immediate Post-Distribution Report (PRR) reporting to AMF on key aspects and numbers for the distribution c) post-distribution activity that includes an assessment of the hang-up rate of nets which triggers additional intervention if necessary, as well as longer term post distribution check-ups (PDCUs) that take place via household visits, typically every 6 months post-distribution of the nets.
- **Reasoning:** This comprehensive section details the rigorous, multi-phase process imposed on local stakeholders. By requiring structured pre-distribution planning, strict in-process documentation, and post-distribution follow-up, AMF ensures accountability and optimal resource use. Such measures help to reduce wastage and administrative overhead, thereby underpinning the charity's cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: How we make decisions.md
- **Quote:** 1. Accurate household-level net need data

What? Number of sleeping spaces and existing usable nets. Why? So we know exactly how many nets each household needs. It is important data is recent and accurate. This helps avoid both over-delivery and under-delivery of nets to households. Over-delivery of nets is wasteful. This can occur if perfectly usable nets are not counted with households receiving four nets when they might only need two. Under-delivery of nets can leave sleeping spaces uncovered and this can compromise breaking transmission. This can occur when one net per two people is the basis for a distribution but the composition of a family might mean more nets are required. Distribution partners will typically carry out a pre-distribution registration survey (PORS) across the entire distribution zone to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of LLNs with at least one year of remaining use. If there have been no, or few, nets distributed in the last three years there _may_ be no need to assess existing usable nets. If recent, accurate data based on the number of people per household exists, it may be the data used for a distribution with additional accuracy being sacrificed in order to achieve an immediate distribution and people protected. In such a case, AMF and the distribution partner discuss whether the data is reliable and up-to-date or whether a new PORS should be conducted.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the operational requirement for accurate net need data, a process imposed on local partners to ensure precise net distribution. By preventing over-delivery (which is wasteful) and under-delivery, it directly contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 2. Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution'

What? Individuals not connected with the communities receiving nets or the government health teams involved in the distribution, are present whenever a net is handed out. They check the beneficiary is identified on the net distribution list and the 'no show, no net' rule is applied. Why? This ensures nets reach those who need them and reduces to an immaterial level the misappropriation of nets.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process requires independent supervision during distribution, a mandate on local stakeholders that minimizes misappropriation. Such oversight ensures resources are efficiently used, supporting cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** Would the distribution partner(s) agree to the four main requirements we have of a distribution?
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt explicitly shows that potential local distribution partners must accept specific operational standards. By imposing such requirements, the charity ensures that only capable partners engage in the distribution, thereby enhancing overall cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: Information we publish.md
- **Quote:** A two-page, twenty-question document summarises where a distribution will take place and all planning, operational and follow-up elements. This is completed by a distribution partner and approved by our Malaria Advisory Group.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a structured operational process imposed on local stakeholders (distribution partners) through formal documentation and approval. Such structured requirements help ensure thorough planning and oversight, which can contribute to cost effectiveness by promoting efficient resource allocation.

- **Quote:** A household-level survey is carried out by the distribution partner to establish the number of sleeping spaces and the number of perfectly usable LIUIs already in place. This net need, per household, forms the basis of the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that local stakeholders are required to conduct detailed pre-distribution surveys to determine actual needs. By matching supply to quantified demand, the process helps prevent over-supply and wastage, aspects that are critical to achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Distribution partners are required to provide a minimum number of photos and minutes of video footage taken during the distribution. This acts as an element of verification for us, as well as being of wider interest to donors and others, to see what went on during the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a requirement imposed on local stakeholders for accountability and verification through multimedia evidence. Such verification processes ensure that operations are implemented as planned, indirectly supporting cost effective practices by confirming proper use of resources.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducted an audit of the malaria case rate data measuring malaria rates in the regions served by AMF's distribution there (more on this data at http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf/updates/February-2013#Additionalmalariacaseratedata). The audit found that the numbers from some of the health centers are less reliable than previously thought due to staff absences, lack of qualified testing personnel, or equipment stock outs, each of which could have led to under-reporting of malaria cases. Also, at times, local health staff reported "people receiving anti-malaria treatment" as opposed to "people diagnosed with malaria by a rapid diagnostic test." Health staff may have given anti-malaria treatment to patients presenting with a fever without testing them, which would have led to over-reporting of malaria cases.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process—namely, auditing and verifying data from local health centers—which imposes accountability on local stakeholders. By critically assessing the data provided by these local actors, AMF can ensure that its measurements of impact (e.g., reductions in malaria cases) are accurate, an essential component for determining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF has requested additional data from local health centers and is in the process of reviewing it.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates that AMF actively enforces requirements on local stakeholders by mandating further data collection. Such operational processes help improve data quality and reliability, thereby supporting more accurate assessments of intervention impact and, by extension, the charity’s cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Don de Savigny 10-22-13 (public).md
- **Quote:** AMF's initial model was successful in providing smaller numbers of nets (e.g., ~5,000 to 50,000) to local NGOs to work at the sub-national level in support of national programs. These distributions had relatively high oversight because of implementation by local on-the-ground NGOs. This allowed AMF to ask for a high degree of reporting detail from each partner.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that AMF’s operational process of working with local NGOs—with high oversight and detailed reporting requirements—ensures accountability in net distributions. By imposing such requirements on local stakeholders, AMF is able to monitor resource use carefully, an approach that underpins cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF's model requests two types of information. First, it requests 'distribution verification' information. This allows reassurance, to donors and others, that nets are distributed as intended and not diverted.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational requirement where local stakeholders are obliged to provide verification data. This systematic collection of information helps ensure that nets reach the intended recipients, reducing waste and misallocation, which is key to enabling cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** AMF has had success in Malawi, at the 250,000 net level, collecting six-monthly post-distribution net use and check-up information, sampling 5% of households receiving nets. The results are impressive.
- **Reasoning:** Here, the routine monitoring of net use—as required from local stakeholders—provides ongoing evaluation of program impact and operational efficiency. This continuous oversight is an example of an operational process that contributes to the charity’s cost effectiveness by ensuring its interventions are both efficient and effective.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_6-30-17_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF and other funders are considering an independent audit. This will include an examination of the existing data for signs of fraud, and visits to 20 randomly-selected villages: 10 in the Eastern Region and 10 in the Western Region. In the Eastern Region, the number of household members and nets will be counted; and in the Western Region AMF will effectively carry out a re-registration of households. The visits will be made by partner organizations that were not involved in the distribution and have no connection to the areas, and two supervisors will oversee the data collection in each location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process involving independent audits and data verification through re-registration and external supervision. These measures, by imposing strict requirements on local data collection and oversight, are intended to ensure accuracy and accountability, which can indirectly enable the charity to be cost effective by preventing misallocation of resources and reducing fraud.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md
- **Quote:** AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory. AMF also seeks to appeal to community leaders by telling them that if they overestimate, other communities won't get nets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process in which AMF imposes specific requirements on local stakeholders (distributors and community leaders) to ensure that nets are directed to areas of genuine need. By mandating communication with local malaria control programs and requiring a beneficiary list, AMF enhances targeting efficiency, a key aspect of their cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Anyone who doesn't carry out a post-distribution survey (without very strong justification) would be given a 2-star rating or less and AMF would not work with them again.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a strict operational mandate that holds local partners accountable through post-distribution surveys. Such requirements ensure only compliant and effective partners continue working with AMF, thereby supporting cost-effectiveness by reducing the risk of misallocation of resources.

- **Quote:** AMF is starting to rate partners on 'Efficient and easy to work with?' 'Did what they said they would do?' and 'Timely provision of reports, photos, video.' AMF seeks to be as quantitative and transparent as possible with these ratings and uses a series of checklists and time-stamped documents to make the ratings.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where AMF quantitatively rates the performance of its local stakeholders. By employing checklists and time-stamped documentation, the charity enforces accountability and transparency. Such measures help ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, reinforcing the overall cost-effectiveness of the organization.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** Before the entire data collection process starts, both sets of data collectors are made aware of the 5% checking process and AMF reports that this motivates the first wave of data collectors to do high-quality work.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational procedure that imposes a quality control requirement on local data collectors. By informing them about a 5% unannounced follow-up check, AMF ensures high-quality data collection, which is crucial for accurate net distribution planning and thus contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A printed draft beneficiary list is returned to each community so they can review the accuracy of the information.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how local community stakeholders are engaged in verifying registration data. By requiring communities to check the beneficiary list, the process increases accountability and accuracy, reducing errors and waste and thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The logistics, monitoring, and operational teams of Ghana's NMCP will be on the ground in all 3 districts, liaising with local health systems to manage and supervise distributions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that AMF collaborates with local governmental teams, imposing on them the responsibility to manage and supervise distributions. This integration of local stakeholders helps streamline operations, ensure local accountability, and support cost-effective implementation of distribution programs.

### Doc Name: Nelson_Coelho_4-15-2016_(public).md
- **Quote:** Concern Universal conducts pre-distribution registration surveys in the four districts in Malawi it carries out net distributions in. These surveys are conducted in cooperation with traditional leaders and local health officials. The purpose of the surveys is to determine how many nets are needed for the upcoming net distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that requires the involvement of local stakeholders (traditional leaders and local health officials) in gathering critical data. By leveraging local expertise for registration, the charity ensures accurate beneficiary counts, which can reduce waste and improve cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** HSAs then visit villages and meet with the village leader, who accompanies the HSA through the process of door-to-door registration. Because there are no detailed maps or geographical information system data for rural Malawi, HSAs rely on the knowledge of village leaders to locate all households in the village. The presence of the village leader also lends credibility to the HSAs and makes households more likely to cooperate.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how operational procedures impose a requirement on local stakeholders—in this case, the village leader—to assist in accurate data collection. Their local knowledge and credibility facilitate thorough registration and thus help avoid errors or omissions that could otherwise lead to inefficient resource allocation.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal often does sensitization work with village leaders prior to the registration process. This encourages the leaders to feel responsible for their communities and recognize that over-reporting may lead to net shortages in other villages.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that the charity imposes behavioral requirements on local stakeholders by sensitizing them to the consequences of inaccurate reporting. This process fosters accountability among local leaders, which minimizes over-reporting and ensures that resources are allocated appropriately, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md
- **Quote:** I spoke with Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky in September last year (2010) and described the Post-Distribution Surveys (PDSs) we were now including as a mandatory element of all distributions for which we fund nets. These surveys, conducted 6, 18, 30 and 42 months post-distribution, allow an assessment of net usage levels and net condition.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF imposes an operational requirement on its local distribution partners to conduct mandatory post-distribution surveys. This process ensures continuous monitoring of net usage and condition, which helps ensure that resources are used effectively, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Second, it is sensible for us to consider the performance of a distribution partner in our assessment of for whom we fund nets. We have many times more requests for nets than we can fulfill (we could fund an additional $10 million in proposals right away if we had the money) and whilst criteria for assessing a distribution proposal will always include the area being badly affected by malaria, our confidence in how a distribution partner will manage pre, during and post-distribution activities is relevant. We want to make sure we are only working with the best organizations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that AMF evaluates local stakeholders (distribution partners) based on their operational processes across all stages of the distribution lifecycle. By imposing these performance requirements, AMF ensures that only organizations capable of managing their responsibilities effectively are funded, which enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Third, we believe that rating distribution partners, as long as it is fair, clear and transparent, and open to challenge by the distribution partner if they disagree with out assessment, can contribute to improved distribution performance, both for them and us. We are rating distribution partners on how easy they are to work with, do they do what they say they will, do they provide distribution reports, photos, and videos in a timely manner, and do they conduct post-distribution surveys. We grade performance in each area as either excellent, strong, acceptable, limited or weak. Overall ratings of a distribution partner will be on a one to five star scale. We will favor working with the 4 and 5 star organizations for future grants.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the operational process of rating distribution partners based on multiple criteria, including carrying out post-distribution surveys. By setting these measurable benchmarks, AMF holds local stakeholders accountable and only continues to work with high-performing partners, which in turn supports cost effective allocation of resources.

### Doc Name: AMF 2-6-2015 (public).md
- **Quote:** In Malawi, the NMCP has adopted some of AMF methodologies to do with data collection and verification in its upcoming 7 million net, 18-district distribution in 2015. Although AMF won't be managing this process, it is interested to observe how multiple districts will carry out distribution according to this particular data-driven approach. AMF believes that it will be allowed access to that data, either directly or via its in-country partners.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that AMF requires local stakeholders—in this case, the NMCP and district operators—to adopt specific data collection and verification processes. By imposing these operational requirements, AMF enhances accountability and monitoring of net distribution, which is a key element in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The greatest challenge AMF faces is finding individuals within key organizations who are willing to embrace AMF's standards for accountability, although it is starting to see some positive shifts related to this issue in Malawi and DRC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the importance of enforcing accountability standards on local stakeholders. The gradual acceptance of these operational processes is critical, as it minimizes risks such as net diversion or mismanagement, thereby supporting the charity's overall cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: Notes from ITN distribution meeting NTCHEU - final-1 2011.md
- **Quote:** There's a consensus that it's important to have Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) collect data on need for LLINs and check it with village headmen/headwomen (as well as checking against health passports when warranted), because there is some risk that people will understate the number of LLINs they have in order to get more for free.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process that requires local stakeholders (village headmen/headwomen) to verify the data collected by HSAs. Such requirements can help ensure accurate data collection and reduce errors or manipulation, which in turn supports cost effectiveness by preventing resource wastage and ensuring nets reach those in need.

- **Quote:** The representative of the National Malaria Control Program made several suggestions for the Ntcheu distribution by Concern:
  * HSAs should not distribute LLINs alone - an HSA Supervisor and village headman/headwoman should be present for any distribution.
  * Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This quote details multiple operational requirements imposed on local stakeholders, such as involving district officials, supervisors, and community leaders during distribution. By mandating these oversight and coordination processes, the charity can avoid mismanagement, ensure accurate needs assessment, and streamline distribution efforts, factors that contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Coordination with the district is important. (Concern replied that the District Malaria Coordinator, present in the meeting, was frequently with Concern's project manager. I note that the District Malaria Coordinator had accompanied us for all of our Wednesday, Thursday and Friday activities.)
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt underscores the importance of integrating local district officials into the operational processes. Active coordination with local stakeholders, like the District Malaria Coordinator, can streamline logistics and decision-making, reducing operational redundancies and costs.

### Doc Name: Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md
- **Quote:** GHS volunteers carry out the registration process, which takes place more than one month before the distribution. Volunteers are organized by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and participate in a number of government health programs, such as vaccination campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the distribution program leverages existing local health infrastructure – by using GHS volunteers who are already active in government programs, the process imposes a requirement on local stakeholders to complete extensive registration work. This approach reduces the need for expensive external personnel and training, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In order to avoid any manipulation of the system, volunteers do not learn the details of the household net allocation process.
- **Reasoning:** By restricting the flow of detailed allocation information to local stakeholders, the operational process minimizes opportunities for fraud or error. This safeguard improves accountability and resource management, which in turn aids in maintaining low operational costs for the charity.

- **Quote:** Volunteers are expected to register 50 households per day and to spend five days doing the registration.
- **Reasoning:** This clear performance benchmark imposed on local volunteers is part of the operational process. Setting such specific targets ensures efficiency and timely data collection, helping to lower per-household registration costs and contributing overall to the cost effectiveness of the program.

### Doc Name: NMCP_Ghana_08-16-16_to_08-18-16_(public).md
- **Quote:** During negotiations, AMF requested household tracing, which requires tracking the nets in order to ensure they reach their intended recipients. The Global Fund also recently made this requirement. When different funders have different requirements and request different types of monitoring data, however, it can be overly burdensome.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process imposed by AMF – household tracing – that requires local stakeholders to track net deliveries. This requirement is aimed at ensuring accountability and that nets reach intended recipients, which is a mechanism that can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing waste and misallocation of funds.

- **Quote:** In future distributions, the NMCP would like to apply a batch number to the nets in each bale in order to more efficiently track whether they reached the intended destination (e.g. the NMCP would know that nets labeled "Batch #0210" were intended for a specific district; if the nets ended up somewhere else, something went wrong).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows a proposed operational process – batch numbering – designed to ensure accurate tracking of net distribution. By imposing such a requirement on local stakeholders, the process aims to detect and correct distribution errors, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_02-08-19_(public).md
- **Quote:** DRC has demonstrated very high rates of malaria prevalence. AMF has already finalized a commitment of 3.4 million nets to DRC, with the option of providing another 8.4 million (it is extremely likely to provide this second round of funding). It chose this financing structure in order to ensure that the government achieved certain milestones prior to receiving further funding. The two-stage financing was also possible because net distributions in DRC are continuous rather than planned three years in advance.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process in which AMF conditions further funding on the achievement of specific milestones by the government. By imposing such requirements on local stakeholders, AMF creates an incentive for efficient implementation and accountability, thereby helping to reduce unnecessary expenditure and promoting cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF found it highly difficult to identify a low-cost partner for PDMs in Togo. Simultaneously, it decided to pursue a strategy of fully electronic data collection. This will result in missed PDM activities (the first round of data collection is scheduled for March of 2019), although AMF believes this loss is outweighed by the opportunity to build the national Ministry of Health's capacity for large-scale electronic data collection. Although AMF's new strategy has been challenging due to unreliable internet connection as well as lack of expertise and infrastructure, it has found in-country partners to be diligent and cooperative. Government officials from Togo have expressed a willingness and capability to collect large-scale registration and distribution data electronically in 2020. AMF has also established partnerships with L'Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques et Demographiques (INSEED), a Togolese organization with significant experience in data collection with electronic devices, and Le Programme National de Lutte Contre le Paludisme (PNLP), which will be responsible for working with health centers to conduct PDMs. INSEED will monitor the PDM processes carried out by PNLP.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF leverages local stakeholder involvement by establishing partnerships and mandating electronic data collection, which imposes operational requirements on national agencies. By building local capacity to collect and monitor data, AMF aims to reduce reliance on potentially costlier external options, thereby enhancing overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherrat_9-9-2015_(public).md
- **Quote:** When AMF began working with a new partner in DRC, there were some inefficiencies in the reporting process, and AMF created a series of templates to simplify the process and reduce the amount of work necessary for both AMF and the partner. AMF also leveraged technology to reduce its workload in reporting to various authorities. These two changes have reduced the amount of time spent on financial reporting by a factor of 5-10. These new systems have also enabled AMF to have current financial information available on its website.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that by implementing standardized reporting processes (through templates and technology), AMF imposes specific operational requirements on local partners. This streamlining reduces administrative burdens and costs, thereby illustrating how such processes contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Because of the large distances between villages and the nature of infrastructure in Nord-Ubangi, it is necessary to accurately estimate how many nets are needed in each village when pre-positioning them before distributions, because it is costly to transport them more than necessary. It is likely more cost-effective to gather and run logistics and operations on very detailed and reliable data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that requiring detailed and accurate data from local stakeholders is an operational process that minimizes inefficiencies—such as over-transportation—and thus enables more cost-effective planning and distribution.

### Doc Name: Rob Mather 5-23-14 (public).md
- **Quote:** In February 2013 AMF was approached by a potential distribution partner and the NMCP to ask if AMF was in a position to immediately fund 300,000 LLINs. The request was to fund the cost of nets as all non-net costs were already covered.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where the local stakeholder (NMCP) is required to cover non-net costs. By imposing this requirement, AMF limits its funding to the nets themselves, which is central to its cost-effectiveness strategy.

- **Quote:** For the larger quantity of nets it was again confirmed by the NMCP that the request was just for nets as all non-net costs were covered.
- **Reasoning:** This reiteration reinforces the operational process of requiring local stakeholders to fund non-net expenses. This process ensures that AMF’s expenditures remain focused solely on the nets, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After six weeks a third party indicated there was a problem with some aspect of AMF's distribution verification requirements. This aspect of the agreement referred to sharing with AMF information the NMCP would naturally collect in the course of carrying out the distribution.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights another operational requirement imposed on local stakeholders—sharing distribution verification data. Although it led to negotiation issues in this instance, it exemplifies how AMF uses operational processes to delegate monitoring tasks to local partners, thereby reducing its own costs and supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF_12-06-18_and_12-17-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF will assess Phase 1 holistically, including quantitative performance targets as well as qualitative criteria such as:
* Timeliness
* Quality of feedback
* Receiving data as expected
* Quality of relationship
All parties are aware that if AMF is dissatisfied, then AMF is legally not committed to provide the 8.4 million nets, and $16-20 million worth of support will be pulled.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF imposes clear performance requirements on its local partners. By setting quantitative and qualitative performance targets and linking them to continued funding, AMF builds accountability into its operational processes, ensuring that only effective and efficient partners are retained. This mechanism reduces the risk of misallocation of resources and contributes to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In addition to providing nets, AMF is also planning to fund:
1. Pre-distribution monitoring (preDM) to monitor operational readiness. AMF funds an independent organization to have someone sit in on meetings of the national malaria control program (NMCP) and report to AMF on progress, meetings, plans, resources, and gaps. AMF later funds an independent organization to go into the field and observe the government's registration process. AMF randomly selects villages for the independent organization to visit, and the organization assesses to what extent registration is happening properly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes the operational processes that impose requirements on local stakeholders such as the NMCP and field registration teams. By mandating independent monitoring and compliance checks, AMF ensures that these local stakeholders adhere to strict operational standards. This oversight minimizes errors and inefficiencies, thereby indirectly contributing to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** AMF believes that it adds value through more detailed procedures and significantly more focus on data. This makes it more likely that more nets reach their intended destination, so further nets are available to cover the gaps.
- **Reasoning:** This quote connects rigorous operational procedures and an emphasis on data quality to improved distribution outcomes. The detailed processes and imposed requirements on local stakeholders help ensure accurate data collection and effective execution, which in turn minimizes wastage and maximizes the reach of nets—key aspects of cost-effective charity operations.

### Doc Name: Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md
- **Quote:** AMF then drafts an agreement for the NMCP, which typically includes the specifics of AMF's approach to operations, data collection, and accountability. AMF then moves forward based on which countries move quickly and are able to agree to AMF's requirements (see below).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how AMF imposes specific operational requirements on local stakeholders. By setting expectations for operations, data collection, and accountability up front, AMF ensures that only partners who can comply with its efficient practices are engaged, thereby promoting cost-effective distribution outcomes.

- **Quote:** For example, AMF requires household registration data that is collected on paper to be converted to electronic form at a data entry center. Previously, AMF had let each country decide how to handle data entry, but found that this resulted in countries using a wide range of different numbers of data entry centers, which sometimes created issues with inconsistent data entry practices, lack of internet access, bureaucratic complexity, etc. AMF learned that it is more effective for it to require that countries use a single data entry center.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of an operational process that imposes a specific requirement on local stakeholders. The standardization—requiring a single data entry center—minimizes inconsistencies, bureaucratic hurdles, and variable practices, which ultimately helps AMF manage costs and enhances overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md
- **Quote:** There are no detailed maps or geographical information system data for rural Malawi, so United Purpose and HSAs rely on traditional authorities and community leaders to locate all the households in the targeted villages.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that imposes a requirement on local stakeholders (traditional authorities and community leaders) to leverage local knowledge for household identification. By using local actors instead of investing in detailed mapping systems, the charity reduces data collection costs and enhances cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Concern Universal communicates the date, time, and place of distributions verbally to village leaders, who relay the information verbally to village members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the use of local stakeholder networks for communication. Requiring village leaders to disseminate distribution details harnesses existing local structures, reducing the need for costly mass communication methods and thereby contributing to cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** In Malawi, AMF's distribution partner Concern Universal provides registration lists to community leaders who read the lists out loud at a community meeting, supervised by Concern Universal, so community members can request edits.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process mandates local stakeholder involvement in data validation. By engaging community leaders and members in verifying registration data, the charity can minimize the need for expensive external monitoring, which in turn supports cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: AMF Summary 2021.md
- **Quote:** Identify distribution partners (in-country non-profit organizations or government agencies) to carry out LLIN distributions. AMF and its partners agree on expectations for the distribution, including who pays for costs other than the purchase price of LLINs (which are always covered by AMF), the process that will be used to carry out the distribution, and what information will be collected and shared with AMF.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how AMF imposes specific operational requirements on local stakeholders by setting clear expectations for distribution processes, cost responsibilities, and data reporting. These imposed requirements help ensure that local partners execute distributions efficiently and transparently, contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Registration: During the registration process, national health system staff or volunteers travel door-to-door in targeted areas to collect the information used to determine the number of LLINs to allocate to each household (e.g., the number of sleeping spaces and/or the number of household members)...
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the operational process where local stakeholders are tasked with collecting detailed local data. By requiring local health staff or volunteers to perform door-to-door registration, AMF ensures that net distributions are accurately tailored to local needs, thereby minimizing waste and enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** Each village was visited daily by a supervisor who checked the dilution of the permethrin and the progress of the installation.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of an operational process where local implementation is closely monitored through daily supervisory visits. Such stringent requirements ensure that technical standards are met, which can improve overall intervention impact and thereby contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After distribution, study staff went door-to-door to ensure that nets were hung properly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores another aspect of operational control—post-distribution follow-up—to guarantee correct net usage. By imposing these requirements on local stakeholders, the process helps maintain high effective coverage, which is essential for the intervention’s cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md
- **Quote:** Robin told us that because government funders are highly concerned with efficiency and insist on tight restrictions and reporting as to how their money is spent. CU has limited funds to spend on overheads and hence has shabbier offices than some of those organizations which raise larger amounts of unrestricted funding from individuals.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the cost constraints imposed by government funders which necessitate efficient operational processes. It implies that CU must adopt practices that leverage local stakeholders, thereby reducing overhead costs and enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For the distribution, they have determined that it's important to rely on existing infrastructure such as a Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), government health workers who each cover a few villages.
- **Reasoning:** This evidence demonstrates an operational process that mandates the involvement of local health workers. By integrating HSAs into the process, CU utilizes pre-existing local resources instead of hiring additional staff, thus lowering costs and improving overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** They also believe in working closely with the District Council on all interventions as the most sustainable means of building service delivery capacity so that local government is able to identify and respond to community needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that CU requires collaboration with local governmental bodies. Such partnerships build local capacity, reduce dependence on external resources, and promote sustainability, all of which contribute to a cost-effective model of charitable operations.
