# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
The evidence offers a rich, multifaceted look into how Malaria Consortium designs and adjusts its operational processes to achieve cost effectiveness. Several interlocking themes emerge from the quotes and their accompanying reasoning, each of which directly speaks to the research question, “What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”

1. Local Partnerships and Stakeholder Engagement

A dominant theme is the intentional effort to build and leverage local partnerships. For example, one quote describes an intervention in Uganda: “In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.” The reasoning emphasizes that this approach ensures the intervention is “tailored to local contexts” and optimizes resource use. Similarly, another quote states, “We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research.” This illustrates that integrating local actors not only builds capacity—supporting long-term sustainability—but also creates efficiencies that directly relate to cost effectiveness. By forging these partnerships, Malaria Consortium minimizes redundancy and taps into established local networks, thereby reducing the need for duplicate resources and streamlining operations.

2. Data-Driven Adaptation and Continuous Monitoring

Closely connected to its local engagement is Malaria Consortium’s commitment to robust monitoring, evaluation, and operational research. As shown in the quote about mass net distribution, the charity asks detailed, context-specific questions: “Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking? We drill down as much as we can.” The reasoning explains that this “drilling down” enables the organization to understand precise local barriers and adjust strategies accordingly. In another instance, the inSCALE project focuses on the attrition rate of trained health workers: “Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.” This process of piloting, evaluating, and then scaling up based on concrete evidence minimizes wasted expenditure by ensuring that only effective interventions are expanded, aligning perfectly with cost-effective operational practices.

3. Tailoring Interventions to Local Contexts

The evidence further suggests that the charity systematically adapts its operational methods to the unique challenges and circumstances in each context. One quote details a comprehensive set of improvements made during the 2016 transmission season: adjustments to implementation guides for mobile populations, synchronization of activities across districts and international borders, and proactive mapping and engagement with established migrant populations. The reasoning explains that these adjustments “are designed to enhance the efficiency—and thereby the cost effectiveness—of the intervention.” Moreover, another passage shows that Malaria Consortium “looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas…and adapted and simplified the tool it developed.” By leveraging existing local systems rather than creating new ones, the charity saves time and resources while enhancing the accuracy and relevance of its interventions.

4. Strategic Site Selection Based on Local Data

The operational process also extends to the strategic selection of intervention sites. One quote notes that “These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.” Another states, “Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.” Both examples demonstrate a data-driven approach to selecting where resources will have the most impact, ensuring that interventions are deployed in regions where they are most needed and can be implemented most efficiently.

5. Economic and Cultural Adaptations

Cost efficiency is also maintained through adaptations that respect local economic and cultural contexts. For example, in one quote, it is noted, “Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.” Adjusting remuneration based on local economic conditions ensures that the interventions remain sustainable. Similarly, operational effectiveness is bolstered by ensuring that training materials are accessible: “Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages.” This cultural and linguistic tailoring reduces miscommunication and reinforces the likelihood of successful intervention delivery without incurring extra unnecessary costs.

6. Iterative Learning and Strategic Scaling

Finally, the charity uses a cyclic process of operational research to improve its interventions continuously. As one quote explains, “Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years.” This iterative process not only refines the intervention to better match local needs but also ensures that resources are only allocated to strategies that have been proven effective in preliminary trials—a crucial step in maintaining overall cost effectiveness.

Connecting the Evidence to the Research Question

Each of these operational processes—local partnerships, data-driven adaptation, contextual tailoring, strategic site selection, economic and cultural customization, and iterative learning—directly addresses the research question of what enables charities to be cost effective. The evidence shows that Malaria Consortium’s deliberate use of local data and partnerships reduces redundancies, optimizes resource use, and adapts interventions in real time, avoiding costly missteps and ensuring that efforts are scalable only when proven. For example, the decision to leverage pre-existing household registers (Quote 6) illustrates a clear cost-saving strategy, while the continuous monitoring and piloting of interventions (Quotes 3, 4, and 12) ensure that the charity remains agile and responsive to local challenges, thereby protecting resources and maximizing impact.

In conclusion, the synthesis of the provided evidence reveals that Malaria Consortium achieves cost effectiveness through a comprehensive and adaptive operational approach. By deeply embedding local engagement, rigorous data collection, tailored intervention strategies, strategic site selection, and continuous improvement into its operations, the charity not only enhances efficiency but also minimizes wastage of resources. Every quoted example—from partnerships in Uganda to the nuanced payment norms for community distributors—demonstrates a clear, evidence-based commitment to leveraging local contexts, thereby directly addressing the research question and providing a detailed blueprint for cost-effective operational processes in charitable interventions.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
The evidence reveals that Malaria Consortium’s commitment to a rigorous, data‐driven pre-intervention phase underpins its cost-effective operations. Across all the quotes, several interrelated operational processes emerge that directly contribute to reducing costs and improving program efficiency.

One clear pattern is the systematic use of pretesting and iterative tool development. For example, the first quote explains how “before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design… based on feedback from these tests.” This iterative process allowed the organization to refine a monitoring tool in controlled and diverse environments, ensuring that once deployed, the tool accurately captured treatment completion rates. The deliberate testing and willingness to switch to rapid assessments when limitations were noted show an adaptive process that minimizes risk while optimizing resources—a critical step for cost effectiveness.

A second operational process is the integration of local and pre-existing systems. In another quote, Malaria Consortium’s decision to engage with ministries of health and explore existing household registration tools demonstrates a strategic use of local knowledge. By “looking for existing household registration tools already in use” and pretesting its adapted version, the organization not only streamlined its data collection process but also avoided duplicative efforts. This move evidences an operational efficiency achieved by aligning with ongoing community programs and reducing the need to develop entirely new systems—a clear driver of cost-effective practice.

A third theme concerns the investment in pre-intervention data collection and scoping exercises. One quote notes that “the grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns” while another states that scoping efforts could “identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.” These examples show that by using small amounts of funding to conduct detailed analyses on potential interventions and funding landscapes, Malaria Consortium is able to prioritize projects that promise higher cost-effectiveness. The proactive gathering of baseline funding information and environmental factors—such as in the ACCESS-SMC program where assessments of malaria burden, transmission, and rainfall patterns were conducted—further illustrates how detailed pre-intervention assessments can fine-tune resource allocation, thereby maximizing impact while containing costs.

The evidence also underscores the value of clear operational planning and prioritization. One quote explains that by “providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance,” the project was more likely to be prioritized by the organization. This pre-definition of scope and timeline is an operational process that not only structures the intervention but also ensures that resources are used efficiently—promoting accountability and reducing the likelihood of cost overruns.

Linking these themes back to the research question—“What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”—the evidence consistently shows that rigorous pre-intervention efforts are at the core of cost-effective operations. The iterative testing of monitoring tools (such as the SMC cards), adaptation of household registration tools in collaboration with local stakeholders, and preemptive scoping for funding and contextual information together create a robust decision-making framework. Each step is designed to ensure that interventions are based on reliable, context-specific data, thus reducing the risk of costly operational errors and wasted resources.

In conclusion, the data suggests that Malaria Consortium leverages a suite of interconnected operational processes that include:

• Iterative development and refinement of monitoring tools, such as the pretesting and adjustment of SMC cards.
• Strategic integration with existing systems through the adaptation and simplification of household registration tools.
• Proactive data collection and scoping to inform funding priorities and assess baseline conditions before rollout.
• Pre-defined project planning with clear scope and timeline to enhance prioritization and resource allocation.

These practices, drawn directly from the provided quote/reasoning pairs, illustrate a thoughtful and adaptive approach. They collectively ensure that intervention designs are responsive to real-world conditions and that resources are concentrated on strategies most likely to be cost effective—directly answering the research question by highlighting the pre-intervention processes that drive operational efficiency in charitable work.
