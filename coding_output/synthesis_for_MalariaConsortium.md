## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Tailoring interventions to local conditions by engaging local partners and government agencies.
- Employing rigorous data collection, monitoring, evaluation, and pilot testing to refine approaches.
- Integrating and adapting existing local resources and systems, such as household registration tools and translated job aids.
- Using data-informed criteria (epidemiological, environmental, migration patterns) to select and adjust intervention areas.
- Fostering sustainable partnerships that promote local ownership and a feedback-driven cycle of improvement.

### Summary:
The evidence illustrates that Malaria Consortium enhances cost-effectiveness by embedding local adaptation into its operational processes. The organization consistently tailors its interventions to the specific needs of each region—whether by partnering with local community-based organizations, engaging government health facilities, or modifying intervention guides based on demographic trends such as migration linked to agricultural practices. A key component of this approach is the rigorous use of monitoring, evaluation, and pilot testing, which allows Malaria Consortium to gather precise local data and scale up only those interventions that prove successful. Additionally, leveraging existing local systems—like household registration tools and culturally adapted training materials—demonstrates an efficient utilization of resources. Together, these processes ensure that interventions are contextually relevant and dynamically adjusted, supporting the overarching goal of achieving cost efficiency while maximizing impact, thereby directly addressing the research question of which operational processes enable charities to be cost effective.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Systematic pre-testing and refinement of tools before full-scale implementation.
- Leveraging existing resources and local tools to streamline data collection.
- Early-stage information gathering on funding landscapes to prioritize opportunities.
- Comprehensive risk and context assessments (epidemiological and environmental) to guide targeted interventions.

### Summary:
Malaria Consortium’s operational approach emphasizes thorough pre-intervention information collection to drive cost effectiveness. The organization systematically pretests and refines key tools—such as the SMC cards and household registration instruments—ensuring that their monitoring and implementation frameworks are both reliable and tailored to local needs. By adapting existing household registers and engaging in detailed assessments of funding situations alongside epidemiological factors (like malaria incidence, transmission patterns, and seasonal variations), Malaria Consortium is able to allocate resources more efficiently and identify cost-effective funding opportunities. These preemptive measures reflect critical operational processes that not only bolster overall program effectiveness but also directly contribute to the charity’s ability to implement interventions in a fiscally responsible manner.
