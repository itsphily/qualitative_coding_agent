# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Pre-intervention Data Collection" Across Charities

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes Across Charities:
- Strategic pre-intervention planning to gather essential operational data.
- Flexibility in intervention timelines to incorporate comprehensive baseline assessments.
- Data-driven decision-making that refines beneficiary targeting and resource allocation.
- Systematic scoping to identify operational gaps and local needs prior to implementation.

### Cross-Charity Summary:
Both GiveDirectly and Malaria Consortium demonstrate that robust pre-intervention data collection is central to enhancing cost effectiveness. GiveDirectly shows how adjusting intervention timelines—with strategies such as delaying token transfers until after thorough baseline surveys and focus groups—can lead to refined targeting and improved resource distribution. In parallel, Malaria Consortium uses extensive scoping and systematic baseline assessments (evaluating factors like disease burden and seasonal variations) to pinpoint funding gaps and prioritize areas of greatest need. Although their approaches differ—one emphasizing operational flexibility and the other a methodical assessment process—both charities underscore that early, targeted data collection is key to effective resource deployment and overall operational efficiency, directly addressing how operational processes can drive cost effective charitable interventions.
