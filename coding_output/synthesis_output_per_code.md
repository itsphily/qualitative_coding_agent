# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location" Across Charities

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes Across Charities:
- Tailoring interventions to local geographic, cultural, and infrastructural conditions.
- Utilizing data-driven decision-making—whether through internal audits and real-time checks or through local epidemiological and environmental assessments.
- Adopting strategic pilot testing and ongoing evaluation to refine and scale interventions.
- Leveraging local relationships: one charity emphasizes internal adaptations and community networks, while the other builds strong partnerships with local governments and community-based organizations.
- Managing risk through calibrated beneficiary selection, financial adjustments (such as indexing transfers or adjusting cost structures), and rigorous internal/external monitoring.

### Cross-Charity Summary:
Both GiveDirectly and Malaria Consortium demonstrate that achieving cost effectiveness relies on flexible, context-specific operational adaptations. GiveDirectly refines its internal controls, beneficiary selection, and cash distribution mechanisms by modifying processes like role splitting, comprehensive audits, and innovative local delivery methods, ensuring that interventions are continually aligned with local needs and economic fluctuations. In contrast, Malaria Consortium builds on robust local partnerships and leverages context-driven data—such as local health indicators and environmental assessments—to strategically select geographic areas and pilot interventions before scaling. Despite focusing on different operational levers—internal structural optimization versus external partnership and data integration—both charities highlight the crucial role of adapting their approaches to local realities. This collective evidence reinforces that calibrating interventions based on specific local contexts is key to optimizing resource allocation, sustaining cost-effectiveness, and ultimately maximizing impact.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Pre-intervention Data Collection" Across Charities

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes Across Charities:
- Systematic and rigorous collection of baseline data informs targeted decision-making.
- Planned adjustments in intervention timelines and dedicated roles/funding streamline data collection processes.
- Detailed baseline assessments—ranging from community feedback and focus groups to technical metrics like disease burden and transmission patterns—ensure accurate targeting.
- Early identification of potential challenges and funding opportunities contributes to effective resource allocation.

### Cross-Charity Summary:
Both GiveDirectly and Malaria Consortium emphasize that robust pre-intervention data collection is fundamental to achieving cost-effectiveness. While GiveDirectly manages this through deliberate timeline adjustments, specialized operational roles, and the integration of community feedback via focus groups, Malaria Consortium adopts grant-funded scoping activities and technical baseline assessments to inform its interventions. Despite these differing approaches, each charity leverages early, systematic data collection to refine targeting criteria, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall program design. These practices collectively illustrate how rigorous pre-intervention planning directly supports operational efficiency and cost-effective impact, aligning closely with the research question.
