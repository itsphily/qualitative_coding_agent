## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes Across Charities:
- Emphasis on local adaptation: Each charity tailors intervention strategies based on the unique geographical, economic, and infrastructural conditions of the location.
- Data-driven decision making: Both organizations rely on detailed, context-specific information—whether through community feedback or systematic data collection—to refine and adjust their approaches.
- Leveraging local partnerships and existing infrastructure: While GiveDirectly focuses on selecting local payment providers and alternative cash-out options, Malaria Consortium utilizes local partnerships and established community systems to streamline operations.
- Operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation: Decentralization, dynamic adjustments in intervention criteria, and flexible distribution mechanisms are key strategies used to align resources with local challenges and opportunities.

### Cross-Charity Summary:
The evidence across GiveDirectly and Malaria Consortium highlights that calibrating interventions to reflect local specifics is central to cost-effective operations. Both charities demonstrate that a flexible, locally informed approach—whether through decentralization to mitigate risks, adapting financial systems to local realities, or harnessing the power of data and community partnerships—can significantly enhance operational efficiency. By adjusting interventions to meet localized economic, infrastructural, and regulatory challenges, these organizations not only optimize resource utilization but also ensure that their strategies are responsive and sustainable. This collective insight underscores that operational processes steeped in local context are critical for achieving cost effectiveness in charitable work.

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes Across Charities:
- Both charities position pre-intervention data collection as a crucial foundation for executing and refining their interventions.
- Structured, phase-oriented approaches and clearly defined timelines are used to integrate baseline data collection into overall operational processes.
- There is a deliberate balance between maintaining research rigor (e.g., through validated targeting, baseline surveys, and contextual studies) and ensuring timely delivery of services.
- Contextual assessments, including community feedback and environmental or funding landscapes, inform the tailoring and prioritization of interventions.
- The collected pre-intervention data drives efficient resource allocation and enhances overall cost effectiveness by ensuring interventions are properly targeted.

### Cross-Charity Summary:
Both GiveDirectly and Malaria Consortium underscore the importance of pre-intervention data collection in their operational models aimed at cost effectiveness. GiveDirectly adopts a flexible, phase-based approach that incorporates essential baseline surveys, strategic enrollment pacing, and community feedback to inform targeting and intervention rollout. In contrast, Malaria Consortium integrates clearly defined scopes and timelines, using contextual assessments—such as environmental factors, funding landscapes, and baseline studies on critical markers—to refine resource allocation and address high-needs effectively. Collectively, these approaches illustrate that meticulous pre-intervention data collection not only strengthens research integrity but also optimizes operational efficiency, directly contributing to the charities' ability to deliver cost-effective services.
