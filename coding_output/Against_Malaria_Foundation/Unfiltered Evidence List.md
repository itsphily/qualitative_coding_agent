---

### Evidence #3

**Quote:** Every 50-250 nets distributed and installed equals 1 life saved

**Doc Name:** Why malaria_.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the outcome of the net distribution and installation process, which is the core intervention. While the text does not explicitly mention local partners or their workforce, the act of distribution and installation implies an operational process on the ground. It is plausible that this process involves engaging with or collaborating with local entities or partners, whose workforce would carry out these tasks. The efficiency of this process, potentially influenced by the skills of the workforce, contributes to the number of lives saved per nets distributed, which relates to the overall effectiveness and potential cost-effectiveness of the intervention. However, the quote does not directly address the research focus on training or skill improvement of this workforce. The link to the aspect "Engaging/collaborating with local partners" is inferential based on the nature of the distribution activity.

**Aspect:**
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

---

### Evidence #4

**Quote:** work with distribution partners to ensure they are used.

**Doc Name:** What we do.md

**Chronology:** during

### Evidence #43

**Quote:** There was a jovial exchange along the lines of "what about when a wife and husband are sleeping separately?" The answer was that they each get a net. There was a question about people who follow a religion that says not to use nets. The answer was that if people don't want nets they shouldn't be registered for them. One HSA asked whether he should register himself, since he doesn't have a net. They said yes, but only on one village register. There was concern about the issue of "what if not everybody gets a net?" The answer was that it's a universal coverage campaign: everyone gets their nets. An HSA said that some people use the nets to kill birds, and CU said HSAs should tell people not to do this, that it's dangerous to eat birds that have been killed with nets because of the insecticide.

### Evidence #88

**Quote:** Common errors included (from most important to least important issues): * Important data missing (2.4% of records): Data for one or more or the following: number of nets given (both numeral and text versions of figures, both of which are required), serial number, number of nets allocated, number of people in household, name of household head. This information is important as it is required to identify a household, allocate and distribute nets. (97.6% of household records (470,016 of 481,460) had the information necessary to identify, allocate and distribute nets.) * Unimportant data missing (46%): Telephone contact information (largely), household location information. Telephone numbers are not key data for the correct assessment and distribution of nets so this is not a key issue. Telephone numbers were missing, incorrect, or incomplete. Sometimes, household members could not recall the correct phone number. This was relatively unsurprising to Episcopal Relief & Development as not every household has a telephone (usually mobile) number.

### Evidence #176

**Quote:** Many studies report intensive measures to ensure that people used their ITNs consistently and properly - measures well beyond what we would expect to be feasible in a larger-scale distribution (and well beyond the measures taken by the Against Malaria Foundation). Sample quotes:23 'Each village was visited daily by a supervisor who checked the dilution of the permethrin and the progress of the installation.' 'Care was taken to place the nets over all beds in each selected house.' 'Mothers of the children in the study cohort were reminded weekly how to use the net. Nets which became torn or damaged were repaired or replaced. A survey was conducted every 4 weeks during the rainy season to determine whether the bed nets had been tucked in and the entry flaps placed correctly.' 'After distribution, study staff went door-to-door to ensure that nets were hung properly.' 'At mass meetings of the intervention group males, insecticide dipping procedures and net erection methods were demonstrated...Two months after bed net distribution, the teams revisited the trial families to give further encouragement.'

**Doc Name:** Info on Intervention.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes intensive measures carried out by "supervisors" and "study staff" in small-scale studies, such as checking insecticide dilution, demonstrating net use, and ensuring proper hanging. These activities require specific skills related to LLIN distribution and usage promotion. The text explicitly states these measures are "well beyond" what is expected in larger-scale distributions like AMF's. This contrast serves as indirect evidence related to the skills and capacity of the workforce in larger programs (potentially including local partners' workforce). It highlights activities that require skills, implying potential skill gaps in larger programs compared to study settings. This relates to "Targeting the workforce of local partners" (as these staff are the workforce), "Developing and delivering training programs" (by illustrating activities that training could cover), and "Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement" (by implying the need for skills to perform these tasks). The studies described were reviewed in a 2004 paper and largely predate the widespread national scale-ups of LLIN distribution, placing this evidence "before" the main intervention period. The motivation for these intensive measures in the studies was to ensure consistent and proper ITN usage to maximize observed effectiveness under trial conditions. The contrast could imply lack of capacity, lack of training, or simply a different operational model in larger programs. The intensive measures in the studies are presented as an exception compared to standard large-scale distributions, implicitly highlighting the less intensive, potentially less skilled, approach in the latter.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Developing and delivering training programs
- Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement

### Evidence #177

**Quote:** We did discuss it with program staff during our visit to an ongoing LLIN distribution (we were told that this issue affects few people and can be avoided by letting an LLIN hang for a few days before use).

**Doc Name:** Info on Intervention.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes interaction with "program staff" during an "ongoing LLIN distribution". These staff are part of the local workforce implementing the intervention. Engaging with them, even for a brief discussion about a minor issue, constitutes "Engaging/collaborating with local partners". While not about training, it is the only direct mention of interaction with the local workforce involved in the distribution, making it relevant to the aspect of engaging with partners. The visit was to an "ongoing" distribution, placing it "during" the intervention period. The motivation for the discussion was to understand issues encountered during distribution (allergic reactions).

**Aspect:**
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

---

### Evidence #178

**Quote:** For the distribution, they have determined that it's important to rely on existing infrastructure such as a Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), government health workers who each cover a few villages. There are 431 HSAs in Ntcheu and 37 health centers. The HSAs are assisting with the pre-distribution survey and the distribution.

**Doc Name:** Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote identifies the Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), who are government health workers, as the local workforce employed by a local partner (the government/District Council) that Concern Universal is relying on for the net distribution intervention. This is evidence of "Targeting the workforce of local partners" and "Engaging/collaborating with local partners" for the intervention. The timing is "during" the planning/preparation phase for the large net distribution.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

---

### Evidence #179

**Quote:** For the new distribution, there's been an orientation for government leaders, and CU is scheduling meetings with HSAs.

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly mentions an "orientation for government leaders" and "scheduling meetings with HSAs" in preparation for the "new distribution" (the large net distribution intervention). Government leaders and HSAs are part of the local partner's workforce (government/District Council). This is evidence of "Developing and delivering training programs" (orientation/meetings serving as training/preparation), "Targeting the workforce of local partners", and "Engaging/collaborating with local partners" for the intervention. The timing is "during" the preparation phase for the large net distribution.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Developing and delivering training programs
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

---

### Evidence #180

**Quote:** We took a about 30 minute drive over bumpy roads to a health center at which an HSA training took place. This was the training for collecting data on who had/needed nets, the same sort of data that had been used on the previous day in the village registration meeting.

**Doc Name:** Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote directly describes a training session specifically for Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs), who are the local partner workforce (government health workers), focused on a skill ("collecting data on who had/needed nets") required for the net distribution intervention.

### Evidence #181

**Quote:** Village WASH committees are taught basic borehole maintenance and local mechanics are taught more advanced maintenance.

**Doc Name:** Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote describes training provided by CU to "Village WASH committees" and "local mechanics" on "borehole maintenance". While this is part of the separate WASH program, these groups can be considered part of the local workforce or local partners (community-level structures CU works with, linked to the District Council). This is evidence of CU's approach to "Training local workforce" and "Improving the skills" of local individuals/groups they partner with, relevant to the overall research code and aspects ("Targeting the workforce of local partners", "Developing and delivering training programs", "Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement", "Engaging/collaborating with local partners"). The timing is "unclear" relative to the net distribution intervention, as it's part of a different, ongoing project.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Developing and delivering training programs
- Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

### Evidence #182

**Quote:** Sanitation programs are through village WASH committees. These committees are made up of volunteers who are trained by community health workers on how to construct latrine platforms and "tippy taps"... The committee members are then tasked with training other village residents. The committees are trained by HSAs, who are trained by CU staff.

**Doc Name:** Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote details a multi-level training structure within the WASH program, involving CU staff training HSAs, HSAs training village WASH committees/community health workers, and committees training residents. This demonstrates CU's strategy for "Training local workforce" and building local capacity through a cascaded training model. It involves various local groups/individuals who can be considered part of the local partner network (HSAs are government workforce, committees/community health workers are community-level partners). This is evidence of "Targeting the workforce of local partners", "Developing and delivering training programs", "Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement", and "Engaging/collaborating with local partners". The timing is "unclear" relative to the net distribution intervention, as it's part of a different, ongoing project.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Developing and delivering training programs
- Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners

**Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of Concern Universal developing and delivering training programs ('HSA training') for the local workforce ('HSAs') involved in the LLIN distribution. It relates to the aspects of targeting the workforce of local partners, developing and delivering training programs, and focusing on skill improvement/enhancement. The interaction between Concern and the National Malaria Control Program representative regarding the training schedule also highlights engagement and collaboration with local partners. The statement that the training 'has already started' indicates this activity is occurring prior to the main LLIN distribution intervention discussed in the meeting, thus the chronology is 'before'.

**Aspect:**
- Targeting the workforce of local partners
- Developing and delivering training programs
- Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement
- Engaging/collaborating with local partners
