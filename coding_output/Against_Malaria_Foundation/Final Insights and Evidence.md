## Partner-Led, Operationally Embedded Training Driven by AMF Standards

**Insight Explanation:** AMF's approach to workforce skill improvement relies on local partners (NGOs, government bodies) to conduct most training activities. This training is tightly integrated with AMF's specific operational procedures, data collection protocols (e.g., household registration, PDCUs), and accountability mechanisms (e.g., '105%' re-surveys). While the `adjusted_summary` refers to 'Structured Training and Capacity Building Programs,' the `deep_synthesis_report` clarifies that AMF itself does not typically develop or deliver comprehensive, formal training curricula. Instead, AMF provides guidelines, data systems (like DES), technological tools (smartphones for data collection), and funding, effectively shaping the content and necessity of training through its rigorous requirements. Skill enhancement is thus a direct consequence of partners needing to meet AMF's high standards for data integrity and process adherence.

**Doc Name:** Notes from Malawi trip - Concern Universal - Oct 2011.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote is evidence for the research code "Training local workforce" as it explicitly mentions an "orientation for government leaders" and scheduling meetings with HSAs, both of whom are part of the local partner workforce. This relates to the aspects "Targeting the workforce of local partners", "Developing and delivering training programs" (orientation/meetings serving as training), and "Engaging/collaborating with local partners". The chronology is before the main distribution, as these are preparatory activities.

---

#### Evidence #5

**Evidence Quote:** Post-distribution surveys ask whether nets are used correctly, with responses being Yes or No. Surveyors ask respondents to demonstrate how they use the nets. If nets are tucked under mattresses with no spaces for mosquitos to get in and there are not large holes (small holes are ok due to presence of insecticide), then the net is considered 'used correctly.' Surveyors assume that all nets in the household are used in the same way the one for which use was demonstrated is--they don't ask respondents to demonstrate multiple nets.

#### Evidence #16

**Evidence Quote:** In the 2016 LLIN distributions in Ghana, AMF's non-profit distribution partners, Episcopal Relief & Development and the Anglican Diocesan Development and Relief Organization (ADDRO), monitored the implementation of the registration and distribution processes by AMF's government distribution partner, Ghana Health Services.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote highlights a monitoring structure where non-profit partners oversee the activities of a government partner's workforce. This is evidence of engaging/collaborating with multiple local partners and implicitly relates to assessing the performance of the government partner's workforce. The timing is during registration and distribution.

---

#### Evidence #17

**Evidence Quote:** During the PDCU check, the enumerator: assesses the number of regularly used sleeping spaces. asks how many people are in the household... checks the brand of the bed nets... records whether the net was distributed by an AMF-funded distribution... assesses the net condition... asks who sleeps under each net... asks how many nets were originally distributed... records how many nets in the household are hung... assesses whether nets are being used correctly.

**Evidence Chronology:** after

**Doc Name:** AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote demonstrates that partner-employed enumerators follow detailed AMF PDCU data collection protocols, reflecting operationally embedded training driven by AMF standards.

---

#### Evidence #18

**Evidence Quote:** From 2016 to 2018, AMF co-funded a "Malaria Unit" in Malawi with United Purpose.15 The Malaria Unit consisted of up to 14 permanent staff members who worked on a variety of malaria control projects: conducting post-distribution surveys, improving malaria case rate data collection practices, monitoring the levels of malaria prevention and treatment supplies at local health centers, developing efficient methods to keep net coverage rates high in between mass distribution campaigns, and more.16 The Malaria Unit assisted with AMF and United Purpose's distributions in Malawi.17 AMF spent about $700,000 over three years on this project.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Unknown Document

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details a joint initiative between AMF and its local partner, United Purpose, to establish a dedicated unit with permanent staff focused on improving various operational aspects of malaria control, including data collection and method development. This directly targets the partner's workforce, implies an assessment of areas needing improvement, involves developing and implementing improved practices (a form of training/skill development), explicitly focuses on skill enhancement (improving data collection, developing methods), and is a clear example of engaging and collaborating with a local partner. This project ran during the period of AMF's large-scale distributions.

---

## Reactive Skill Gap Identification Driven by Operational Demands

**Insight Explanation:** Both reports indicate that the need for training and skill enhancement within local partner workforces is primarily identified when AMF's demanding operational model, including its stringent data collection and verification protocols, meets existing partner capacities. The `adjusted_summary` highlights 'Identification of Skill Gaps and Responsive Corrective Actions' based on monitoring. The `deep_synthesis_report` strongly corroborates this, noting a 'pervasive absence' of formal, proactive skill gap analyses by AMF before engagement. Instead, skill needs become apparent through operational challenges, data quality issues revealed by AMF's monitoring and verification processes (e.g., '105%' checks), or when AMF introduces new methodologies or technologies (like electronic data collection) that inherently require new competencies.

### Related Evidence

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** AMF identifies and approaches organisations, potential distribution partners, that may have the resources and necessary experience in-country to participate in a net distribution.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Our Process.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote indicates a proactive assessment of partner experience before engagement, which contradicts the insight's claim of a 'pervasive absence' of proactive skill gap analyses by AMF prior to engagement.

---

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** The audit found that the numbers from some of the health centers are less reliable than previously thought due to staff absences, lack of qualified testing personnel, or equipment stock outs, each of which could have led to under-reporting of malaria cases.

**Evidence Chronology:** after

**Doc Name:** Rob Mather 2013 08 15 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes findings from an audit of past distribution data. It identifies "lack of qualified testing personnel" among local health center staff as a reason for data unreliability. This serves as evidence for the "Training local workforce" code by highlighting a skill gap ("lack of qualified testing personnel") within the workforce of local partners (health centers). The audit process itself represents an effort to assess issues, which implicitly points to a need for improved skills or training. The timing is after the intervention, as the audit reviewed data from past distributions.

---

#### Evidence #3

**Evidence Quote:** For future surveys, AMF plans to ask surveyors to confirm that they saw batch numbers.

**Evidence Chronology:** after

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes a planned change in the survey procedure that will be implemented in the future. This change directly impacts the tasks performed by the local workforce (surveyors) and implies that they will need to be instructed or trained on this new requirement. This serves as evidence for the 'Training local workforce' code by indicating future development of training content or procedures. It relates to 'Targeting the workforce of local partners' as it concerns surveyors, 'Developing and delivering training programs' as it implies new instructions will be developed and delivered, and 'Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement' as it adds a new step to the survey process. The timing is 'after' as it describes a future plan relative to the conversation date.

---

---

#### Evidence #5

**Evidence Quote:** The data collector was identified through his unique log-in and was immediately dismissed by AMF's distribution partner. The distribution partner reported the incident to AMF in their weekly report. After this incident, policy was changed so that data entry clerks do not work on data covering their own or nearby villages.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote demonstrates AMF's reactive identification of issues in partner workforce through operational monitoring and its responsive corrective action, aligning with the insight's theme of reactive skill gap identification driven by operational demands.

---

#### Evidence #6

**Evidence Quote:** Third, we decided to begin a process of formally rating Distribution Partners on the basis of our experience of working with them and to make those ratings available to the public.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the initiation of a formal process to rate distribution partners based on experience, reflecting reactive identification of strengths and weaknesses through operational engagement rather than proactive analysis.

---

#### Evidence #7

**Evidence Quote:** While visiting the Northern Region distribution, Mr. Walsh observed that there was a lack of good documentation on the number of nets removed from one location for transport and the number of nets arriving at the other end. He addressed this with the NMCP, which acted quickly to fix the problem through retraining.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes AMF identifying an operational issue (lack of documentation) with a local partner (NMCP). This issue represents a skill or process gap. AMF engaged with NMCP, and NMCP responded by implementing retraining, which is a form of developing and delivering a training program aimed at improving the skills and performance of their workforce involved in logistics. This serves as evidence of assessing skill gaps, developing/delivering training, focusing on skill improvement, and engaging with local partners. The observation and retraining occurred during the Northern Region distribution phase, which is part of the overall intervention.

---

#### Evidence #8

**Evidence Quote:** After the grace period, coupon books are returned to the district level for the post-distribution validation process. This is carried out by the NMCP and non-profit partners, and involves analyzing the coupon books in order to: * Check for coupons that were not crossed out; for example, this scenario might arise if a household did not pick up their nets. * Check that the number of nets allocated matches the number of nets given.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the post-distribution validation process carried out by local partners (NMCP, non-profit partners). Analyzing coupon books to check for errors like uncrossed coupons or mismatches in numbers allocated vs. given is a method for assessing the accuracy and adherence to procedures by the local workforce (distributors). Identifying these discrepancies helps assess potential skill gaps or operational issues that occurred during distribution. This occurs after the distribution and grace period, which is part of the overall intervention.

---

#### Evidence #9

**Evidence Quote:** To be hired, enumerators will have to pass an interview and a test.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Givewell_AMF_Ghana_site_visit_August_15-18_2016.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the hiring requirements for enumerators (part of the local workforce for PDCUs). Requiring candidates to pass an interview and a test is a method for assessing their skills and suitability for the role before hiring them. This is evidence of assessing potential skill gaps during the recruitment process for the local workforce. This occurs before the PDCU phase begins, but within the overall intervention timeline.

---

#### Evidence #10

**Evidence Quote:** Since being designated as such, RAM has had to adjust to distributing larger quantities of nets.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** AMF_02-08-19_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote provides evidence for the 'Training local workforce' code by describing a challenge faced by the local partner RAM, requiring them to 'adjust'. This implies a need for skill adaptation or development to handle increased scale, relevant to 'Assessing skill gaps and training needs' and 'Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement'. The timing is 'during' the intervention period, describing RAM's experience since taking on the role.

---

#### Evidence #11

**Evidence Quote:** There was a delay of eight months in AMF's distribution in Balaka District for two reasons First, errors in data collection led to the pilot pre-distribution registration survey (pilot PDRS) having to be re-done and, some of the results of the full PDRS were implausible, so a portion of the PDRS had to be redone. This resulted in a delay of four months. Second, available net production slots across the candidate net manufacturers contributed a further four months delay. CU demonstrated a strong approach to data errors and inaccuracies that can conceal larger problems, and AMF was pleased to see CU's commitment to ensuring the information that underpinned the distribution was sound.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Rob Mather 5-23-14 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes data collection errors made by the local partner (Concern Universal) during a distribution, which caused significant delays. This serves as evidence for the research code "Training local workforce" by highlighting a specific skill area (data collection) where the local partner's workforce experienced issues. The need to redo surveys due to errors points to potential skill gaps or training needs ("Assessing skill gaps and training needs"). AMF's observation and positive comment on CU's "strong approach" and "commitment" suggest that efforts were made by the partner to address these errors and improve data quality ("Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement"). The interaction between AMF and CU regarding these errors demonstrates "Engaging/collaborating with local partners". The event occurred during the Balaka distribution in October 2013, which is an instance of the intervention, so the chronology is "during".

---

#### Evidence #12

**Evidence Quote:** AMF has had conversations with individual Nigerian organizations, states, and the NMCP, and has offered to fund nets, but has been unable to reach a basic level of agreement on accountability and data collection.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Rob_Mather_06-14-18_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes AMF's engagement with local partners in Nigeria and the difficulty encountered in agreeing on standards for accountability and data collection. The inability to reach agreement highlights challenges in implementing skill improvement or standardized procedures with certain partners. The timing is during AMF's attempts to fund distributions in Nigeria.

---

#### Evidence #13

**Evidence Quote:** For distributions with "105%" registration data collection, after staff or volunteers have collected registration data from households, a different group of staff or volunteers revisit 5% of households and independently collect registration data.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the implementation of the '105%' data verification checks, aligning with the insight explanation's reference that AMF uses 105% checks as a mechanism to reveal data quality issues and thereby identify skill gaps reactively.

---

#### Evidence #14

**Evidence Quote:** AMF has told us that, for the first PDCU for the Northern Region in Ghana in November 2016, there will be "5% of the 5%" data collection--a separate set of data collectors re-visiting a random selection of 5% of the households selected for the PDCU to re-collect data.

**Evidence Chronology:** after

**Doc Name:** AMF Supplementary Information 2021.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes AMF's stringent verification protocol (the 5% of the 5% check), which underpins the insight that operational demands reveal skill gaps by enforcing strict data quality procedures. While it doesn't explicitly mention skill gaps, it demonstrates the mechanism that leads to reactive identification of training needs.

---

#### Evidence #15

**Evidence Quote:** In addition, in 2017, GiveWell commissioned a project with IDinsight to better understand the survey methods used in several countries and to provide suggestions for AMF for the future. IDinsight's report with recommendations for the implementation of AMF's post-distribution monitoring is available here; AMF notes that its current monitoring procedures implement the majority of these recommendations.13

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** AMF Summary 2021.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This demonstrates AMF identifying methodological skill gaps via monitoring (external evaluation) and implementing responsive corrective actions, aligning with the insight's theme of reactive skill gap identification based on operational monitoring.

---

## Focus on Technical Data Skills and Systemic Capacity, Less on Soft Skills

**Insight Explanation:** Both reports confirm a strong emphasis on improving local workforce skills in areas critical to AMF's model: accurate household-level data collection, adherence to rigorous verification protocols, and the use of technology (data entry systems, electronic data capture). The `adjusted_summary` details training on these aspects. The `deep_synthesis_report` concurs, highlighting the evolution towards enhancing national systems' capacity (e.g., MoH in Togo, NMCPs adopting AMF methods), indicating a move towards sustainable, systemic skill improvement. However, the `deep_synthesis_report` also notes a relative absence of focus on developing 'softer' skills like advanced problem-solving or leadership within the partner workforce, or on enhancing specific pedagogical techniques for community mobilization and health education delivery, beyond ensuring these tasks are executed.

### Related Evidence

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** There are four operational elements to a distribution we consider important. We discuss these elements with potential distribution partners and if they share our approach to a distribution, we are keen to work with them: 1. Accurate household-level net need data 2. Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution' 3. Post-distribution monitoring of net use and condition 4. Monthly malaria case rate data

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** How we make decisions.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** The quote directly emphasizes accurate household-level net need data and monitoring as key operational requirements, confirming emphasis on technical data skills for partner workforce.

---

#### Evidence #5

**Evidence Quote:** AMF seeks to ensure that its nets are going to places that lack nets. It does this by requiring distributors to communicate with national or district-level malaria control programs and by almost always requiring applications to include a beneficiary list that was complied through a household sleeping space inventory.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Rob Mather (AMF) 2011 03 16 - Summar.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes requirements placed on distributors, who are local partners, regarding communication and data collection procedures. These requirements necessitate specific actions from the partner organizations and their staff (local workforce). This serves as evidence for the 'Training local workforce' code by implying that partners and their staff must be instructed or trained on how to fulfill these requirements. It relates to 'Engaging/collaborating with local partners' by describing the operational requirements of the partnership and 'Developing and delivering training programs' as it implies instruction on these procedures. The timing is 'during' as it describes current requirements.

---

#### Evidence #6

**Evidence Quote:** The data collector was identified through his unique log-in and was immediately dismissed by AMF's distribution partner. The distribution partner reported the incident to AMF in their weekly report. After this incident, policy was changed so that data entry clerks do not work on data covering their own or nearby villages.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_2-11-16_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote is evidence because it describes an incident involving a member of a local partner's workforce (a data collector) and the subsequent actions taken by the partner (dismissal) and a policy change implemented afterwards. This relates to "Targeting the workforce of local partners" by addressing issues within that workforce and implementing measures to prevent future problems. The policy change can be seen as a process improvement aimed at ensuring higher quality and integrity in data collection, thus indirectly relating to "Focusing on skill improvement/enhancement" by improving the system within which the workforce operates. The incident occurred "during" a distribution, and the policy change happened "after" the incident but likely "during" the overall period of AMF's operations.

---

#### Evidence #7

**Evidence Quote:** We are rating distribution partners on how easy they are to work with, do they do what they say they will, do they provide distribution reports, photos, and videos in a timely manner, and do they conduct post-distribution surveys.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Rob Mather 2011 02 11 v2.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote lists the specific criteria used to rate distribution partners. These criteria are performance metrics that assess various operational aspects carried out by the partner's workforce (e.g., timeliness of reporting, conducting surveys). This serves as evidence for assessing skill gaps and training needs by identifying areas where partners perform well or poorly. The goal of rating is improvement, linking it also to focusing on skill improvement/enhancement. The timing is during/after the intervention as the rating system is active.

---

#### Evidence #8

**Evidence Quote:** AMF had proposed carrying out a three-phase distribution of 3.2 million nets to pilot the use of digital electronic devices, such as smart phones and tablets, for data collection.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Rob_Mather_and_Peter_Sherratt_10-15-15_and_10-22-15_(p.md

## Tension Between Stated Partner Competence and Rigorous Oversight

**Insight Explanation:** The `adjusted_summary` explicitly identifies a contradiction regarding 'Divergent assessments of partner workforce competence.' While AMF may state a general belief in partners' ability to conduct high-quality registration, both reports detail extensive and meticulous monitoring, data verification (e.g., '105%' re-surveys, independent monitoring), and quality assurance mechanisms. The `adjusted_summary` notes that deficiencies trigger retraining and policy changes. The `deep_synthesis_report` reinforces that AMF's high standards and monitoring often reveal gaps. This suggests that while foundational trust in partners exists, practical implementation across diverse and challenging contexts necessitates continuous oversight, data-driven performance management, and responsive training interventions to maintain quality and address the 'Persistent Operational and Workforce Capacity Constraints' highlighted in the `adjusted_summary`. The '105%' re-survey, described in the `adjusted_summary` as having a dual purpose (motivation and data check), exemplifies this approach of building in mechanisms that both encourage and verify quality.

## Requirement-Driven Collaboration Aimed at Systemic Capacity

**Insight Explanation:** Both reports illustrate that AMF's collaboration with local partners (NMCPs, NGOs) for skill enhancement is fundamentally shaped by AMF's detailed operational requirements, particularly concerning data quality, monitoring, and accountability. The `adjusted_summary` shows AMF discusses its key operational elements with partners and rates them on adherence. The `deep_synthesis_report` (Aspect: Engaging/collaborating with local partners) describes this as 'Requirement-Driven Collaboration,' where AMF provides support (guidelines, data systems like DES, funding, direct input from AMF staff) to help partners meet these standards, which in turn drives workforce skill development. A key evolution noted in both reports is the increasing focus on longer-term engagement to build sustainable capacity within national systems (e.g., supporting MoH in Togo for electronic data collection, NMCPs adopting AMF methodologies), moving beyond project-specific training to fostering institutionalized best practices.
