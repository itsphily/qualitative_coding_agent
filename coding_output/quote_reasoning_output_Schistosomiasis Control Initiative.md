## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 1.md
- **Quote:** Our schistosomiasis treatment programmes specifically target school-age children and adults considered at risk, such as fishing communities, living in endemic regions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity tailors its intervention strategy to local risk profiles, indicating an operational adjustment based on specific location characteristics. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, targeting high-risk groups is a common method to optimize resource allocation, which can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In areas with very high rates of infection, entire communities may be treated through mass drug administration.
- **Reasoning:** This statement illustrates that the charity adapts its intervention strategy based on local infection rates. By modifying the approach to suit the severity of local outbreaks, the process likely improves operational efficiency and may lead to cost effectiveness through economies of scale, even though the document does not directly state cost savings.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Our biostatisticians develop risk maps, detailing predicted levels of infection across endemic areas. These maps show which areas require treatment and how often to distribute treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where intervention strategies are tailored based on local infection risks. By identifying which areas need treatment and at what frequency, the charity can more efficiently allocate resources—an approach that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** To determine how often treatment will be needed in an area, the risk level is assessed based on prevalence of infection and according to the World Health Organization guidelines.
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains that the frequency of treatment is determined by assessing local infection prevalence using established guidelines. Adapting treatment frequency to the specific characteristics of each location implies a targeted use of resources, which is a key factor in achieving cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** This all helps determine what real-time adaptations may be needed to ensure that programmes continue to have the highest impact and are a best practice in public health.
- **Reasoning:** Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, it highlights the importance of making real-time adaptations based on ongoing evidence. Such adaptive strategies ensure that interventions remain effective and resource-efficient, thereby indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-09-14 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Unlike in Sub-Saharan Africa, where SCI distributes praziquantel for schistosomiasis and albendazole for STH in equal amounts, Sudan has many areas where schistosomiasis is a problem but STH are not, and SCI distributes more praziquantel than albendazole. However, a small number of areas including Kassala and eastern Sennar have STH and no schistosomiasis.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how SCI adjusts its intervention strategy based on the local epidemiological profile. By distributing different amounts of drugs depending on the local disease prevalence, SCI tailors its approach to meet specific needs which can prevent overspending on unnecessary treatments, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Cote d'Ivoire is working toward creating an integrated program for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and STH. This will involve collaboration and integration of tools and training, but drugs for all four diseases will not be administered simultaneously. So far, lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis treatments have been integrated, and schistosomiasis and STH treatments are administered together but currently delivered separately from lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adaptation where SCI is structuring its intervention based on the characteristics of the local disease burden. The integration of treatments for some diseases while treating others separately suggests a tailored approach that aims to streamline operations and reduce redundancy, an approach that likely contributes to improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-08-01 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In a Tanzania impact survey, a sample of two schools per district was selected for the survey. These schools were not selected at random; instead they were schools that had been found to be highly endemic of SCH in the previous survey. These selection decisions were made when program managers had a high degree of independence in determining how they would conduct their programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local epidemiological data is used to adapt the intervention approach by selecting high-risk schools rather than using random sampling. Tailoring the selection based on specific local characteristics can potentially improve cost effectiveness by concentrating efforts where the need is greatest.

- **Quote:** SCI recently conducted a survey to remap the prevalence and intensity of STH and SCH in Burundi. These data allow SCI to understand which areas still require treatment, and with what frequency.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the use of location-specific data to determine treatment needs and frequencies. By understanding local disease patterns, SCI can tailor its intervention strategies to focus resources effectively, which is likely to enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-11-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The monitoring and evaluation data that SCI requires is based on a global standard. It is generally not used to adjust the program at the national level because any problems it identifies are dealt with at a local level.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that while SCI employs uniform global monitoring, the process for addressing issues is decentralized to the local level. This operational process suggests that intervention strategies are adapted based on local conditions—a practice that could enhance cost effectiveness by tailoring responses to specific challenges in each location.

- **Quote:** Disease mapping in the country found less _S. haematobium_ than expected, but fairly high levels of _S. mansoni_. The prevalence of STHs was very high and has convinced the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to put more attention on STHs.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights significant local variation in disease prevalence, which has influenced shifts in intervention focus. While it does not explicitly link these adjustments to cost effectiveness, it implies that adapting strategies based on localized epidemiological data can lead to more efficient allocation of resources.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** Over time, costs per treatment should drop.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links an operational expectation to cost effectiveness by implying that adaptations and efficiencies in the intervention process will result in declining costs per treatment over time.

- **Quote:** Also, after the first year, training can be shorter and take place within districts rather than bringing everyone to a central location.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a specific operational adaptation based on local conditions—shifting from centralized to localized training—which is designed to reduce logistical costs and improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI recommended that the program start in only one province, where transportation would not be as difficult, so that it could make sure the program is done well and can assess the costs.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights an adaptation of the intervention strategy based on the specific geographic characteristics of a location (ease of transportation), thereby managing costs more effectively and ensuring that the intervention is cost efficient.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In certain countries where the national ministries of health lack sufficient capacity, Ms. Labry has identified reliable local NGOs that will accept and distribute SCI's funds into their bank accounts. SCI will pay for a local accountant or account assistant who will work in the NGO's office, collecting and distributing SCI's funds. SCI will also pay 5-6% of the NGO's local office overhead. This is a more cost-effective solution than establishing offices in all of SCI's countries. So far, SCI has implemented this system in DRC, Cote d'Ivoire, and Tanzania, and it hopes to gradually begin implementing it in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how SCI adapts its operational processes to local conditions by partnering with local NGOs when government capacity is limited. The explicit mention of this method being a "more cost-effective solution" directly addresses the research question regarding how tailored intervention strategies contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** As of March 2015, SCI had significantly increased the funding allocation for its Ethiopia program. This is due in part to the recent completion of a two-year, PS1 million project, funded by SCI, to map the entire country at the woreda (district) level. SCI now has a better understanding of where STH and schistosomiasis treatment are needed in Ethiopia.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where SCI uses detailed local mapping to identify the specific needs of different districts. Although it does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, tailoring interventions based on precise local information is likely to enhance resource allocation efficiency and thus contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-12-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI also faces a risk of fraud at the country level, as MoHs often have limited capacity to manage and report on grants. SCI has made some efforts to address this risk. In some countries, such as Madagascar and Niger, rather than transfer funds directly to the MoH, they are sent through in-country non-governmental organization (NGO) partners who verify program activity logs before releasing the funds. (This process was also being set up in Tanzania when Ms. Labry was leaving SCI.) NGOs tend to have better accounting systems in place, as well as staff trained in grant monitoring. In Ethiopia, SCI hired an in-country finance manager to oversee the grant management process in collaboration with the government. SCI's risk of fraud at the country level is probably similar to other organizations doing the same type of work.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines how SCI adapts its operational processes based on local conditions—by using in-country NGO partners for verifying program activity logs and hiring a local finance manager—to mitigate risks like fraud and delays. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, these adaptations suggest that tailoring intervention strategies to specific local financial management capacities could lead to more efficient fund usage, thereby contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In 2005 in Tanzania a child died soon after the MDA (which was determined to not be due to the treatment). This was quickly escalated to superiors and handled well by the program staff. However, the family went on the radio and many parents pulled children out of school to avoid treatment. The following year, the program did extra social mobilization before the MDA and was able to achieve high coverage rates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational adaptation where the program responded to a locally specific challenge (negative public reaction following an incident) by modifying its intervention strategy (implementing extra social mobilization). The improved coverage in the subsequent round implies a more efficient use of resources, suggesting a contribution to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In another case, Malawi had low coverage rates in one MDA. In response, the program heavily invested in social mobilization and had much higher coverage in the next round.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity adapts its intervention strategy based on local performance data. By responding to low coverage with targeted social mobilization, the program likely improved its efficiency in reaching beneficiaries, which is a key factor in enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-04-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Using a set of weighted criteria, SCI ranks countries based on the approximate level of effort required to implement programs. With this information, SCI is able to identify appropriate country pairings and allocate reasonably sized workloads among program managers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where SCI assesses country-specific characteristics (i.e., the required level of effort) to allocate resources, which implies that adapting interventions based on local conditions can lead to more efficient, cost-effective management.

- **Quote:** Figures and treatment numbers in the initial versions of SCI's annual budgets are based on an optimal situation. They are refined as new information becomes available regarding:
* Drug availability in country and in the market; for example, there can be frequent shortages of praziquantel.
* Epidemiological mapping results.
* Opportunities for cost-sharing with other funders.
* The program delivery capacity of the country's Ministry of Health (MoH).
* The success of SCI's fundraising efforts.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates that SCI adapts its budgeting process based on updated, location-specific information such as drug availability and local health capacity. These adaptive measures are intended to optimize resource allocation and can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI has always signed formal contracts with countries, but many were first signed five or six years ago and amended annually to ensure that they accurately reflect the current budget and plans.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI regularly revises its operational agreements with countries to reflect current budgets and conditions. Although not explicitly linked to cost effectiveness, these contract amendments indicate an ongoing process of adaptation that could help in maintaining cost-efficient interventions.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Data like these, combined with local knowledge, provided some sense of the problem (for example, that a small number of areas could basically be excluded because they are sandy and not populated) but were not robust enough to begin a national-scale SCH/STH program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how local contextual factors—such as geography and population distribution—are used to adapt the intervention strategy by excluding areas with low risk. Such targeted adaptation can contribute to cost effectiveness by focusing resources only where they are needed.

- **Quote:** The results of the nationwide mapping are now a major factor in the development of the design of the treatment plan. They were broadly in line with Dr. French's expectations. For example SCH existed in the areas where it was expected to and STH exists pretty much everywhere. The mapping showed that there may be slightly less SCH than expected, that SCH is focally distributed (as is expected), and there are many areas that need STH-only treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates the operational process of using detailed mapping data to tailor intervention strategies based on regional disease distribution. By identifying areas with differing treatment needs (e.g., SCH vs. STH-only), the organization can allocate resources more efficiently, thus potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-10-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI expects to spend on average about $0.25 per treatment in each country, though in the final budget estimates (which SCI expects to receive around January) some countries may cost more and some less. For example, costs are lower in Sudan because the government provides matching funds for the program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that SCI adjusts its cost estimates based on location-specific factors, such as government matching funds in Sudan that lower costs. This adaptation in operational strategy based on local characteristics directly relates to enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** If SCI raises more funding than expected, it would likely enter smaller countries such as Chad. If SCI does not meet its fundraising goals, it would eliminate its new Nigeria program first.
- **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates SCI's strategic decision-making process in adapting its intervention portfolio based on local cost considerations and funding availability. By opting to enter lower-cost countries or dropping more expensive start-up programs, SCI leverages location-specific characteristics to optimize cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-14 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** During program planning, Ms. Nalule works directly with the national government to develop budgets and plans for the year (e.g. scheduling treatments, training, advocacy, etc.). The SCI budget is more or less set in advance, and with this information, local health ministers decide the best uses of funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where intervention strategies are adapted to local conditions through direct collaboration with local government. Allocating budgets and planning based on local input suggests a tailored approach that can improve cost effectiveness by ensuring funds are used optimally according to each location’s needs.

- **Quote:** One lesson from the coverage survey was that coverage of non-enrolled children was very low. It was surprising and disappointing to learn about the issue but good to catch at this point because the MDA strategy can be adjusted.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that the charity uses operational feedback (from a coverage survey) to identify gaps in reaching target populations, and then adjusts the intervention strategy accordingly. Although cost effectiveness is not mentioned explicitly, adapting the strategy based on local performance data has the potential to reduce wasted resources and improve overall impact.

- **Quote:** Also, SCI is taking over treatment from RTI in 15 districts that have higher prevalence, and, in these districts, it will treat adults. Since prevalence is over 50% WHO guidelines say to treat children and high risk adults (e.g. fisherman), though usually programs will just try to treat all adults.
- **Reasoning:** Here the shift in treatment strategy—expanding from children to include adults in high-prevalence districts—is a clear example of adapting interventions based on location-specific epidemiological characteristics. This targeted approach suggests an effort to optimize resource use, which in turn can contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** We don't actually employ anybody in Africa because I believe strongly that the program should belong to the Africans. If you were to put an American expatriate in a country it would probably cost nearly $500,000 a year to sustain that person, they would end up running the program, and the local African people would not have ownership.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains that SCI deliberately avoids hiring expensive expatriate staff and instead relies on local personnel. This operational decision adapts the intervention to local economic contexts and ownership structures, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness by reducing personnel costs and promoting sustainability.

- **Quote:** The ones in Cote d'Ivoire are pilot projects and we have used the results there to prepare the national plans and train people. We now need money to expand.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI conducts pilot projects in specific locations to tailor its strategies based on local results. By using localized data to develop national plans and training programs, SCI adapts its intervention to the unique characteristics of each area, a process that can lead to improved cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** A team of government staff goes out to each village, trains the teachers, counts out the number of drugs that are needed in each village, and gives the drugs to the teachers. Then they come back 3 months later and evaluate the program and make sure the schoolchildren have received the drugs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the involvement of local government staff in executing and evaluating the intervention at the village level, an operational process that leverages local resources and infrastructure. Such a strategy not only adapts the intervention to the local context but also helps contain costs by using existing community mechanisms.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** As Ethiopia is larger than most of the countries in which SCI operates, SCI is in the process of assessing what type of coverage survey methodology is most appropriate. It has consulted with the Task Force for Global Health, which is currently trialing a number of coverage survey designs. SCI will likely employ cluster sampling to create a national sample; this will be the same as or similar to the approach they have used in the past. Obtaining the required amount of detail using this method at a district level would not be cost effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how SCI recognizes the unique geographic scale of Ethiopia and adapts its operational process—choosing a national cluster sampling method instead of overly detailed district-level data collection—to maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CNTD proposed this approach for SCI and CNTD's Spring 2015 MDA in Mozambique. SCI had planned to use its normal methodology but agreed to use CNTD's protocol as it had stakeholder support and SCI was eager to proceed with the survey.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that in Mozambique, SCI adjusted its usual intervention strategy by adopting CNTD's protocol, leveraging local stakeholder support. While cost effectiveness is not stated explicitly, this adaptation implies a tailored process likely aimed at improving efficiency in a context with specific local characteristics.

### Doc Name: 2014-04-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI has given DFID a plan for how it expects to allocate funds by country, but will have discretion to alter these allocations in response new data and to the evolving situation in each country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows an operational process where SCI adapts its intervention strategies based on updated, location-specific data. By allowing flexibility in allocations, SCI can respond to the unique needs and circumstances of each country, potentially leading to enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Cost per treatment tends to be lower in larger countries that are treating at national scale, countries that are at a later stage of the program, and countries where funding is available from other sources (which increases opportunities for collaboration and cost sharing).
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains that SCI examines and adapts based on country-specific conditions such as scale of operations and additional funding opportunities. This adaptation, focused on achieving lower costs per treatment, underlines how aligning intervention strategies with local characteristics contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, SCI has allocated unrestricted funds to Mozambique, a large country with a national scale program, because it has some USAID funding for other NTD programs, so there is a lower cost per treatment in the country.
- **Reasoning:** This concrete example illustrates SCI's practice of tailoring funding allocations based on the local context—here, Mozambique's large scale and complementary donor support lead to lower treatment costs. This supports the idea that adapting operational strategies to the specific characteristics of each location can improve cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2016-04-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Funding may be a limiting factor for delivering deworming treatments in Madagascar, but SCI does not believe it would have allocated additional funding to Madagascar for its 2016-2017 budget year even if it had had additional resources available, since updated disease prevalence mapping data that could be used to more accurately estimate target treatment numbers is not currently available.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where SCI adapts its intervention strategy based on the availability of crucial local data. By choosing not to allocate additional funding in Madagascar without adequate mapping data, SCI is likely avoiding inefficient resource allocation, which contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** If SCI had had additional funding for its 2016-2017 budget year, it would likely have allocated more funding for deworming in Sudan, since there is sufficient in-country capacity and enough paraiquantel tablets to scale up target treatment numbers.
- **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates that SCI tailors its intervention approach to the local context by planning to invest more in areas where the necessary resources and capacity exist. Such targeted allocation is a key operational process leading to better cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Additional funding also might have enabled SCI to fund an NGO's proposal to attempt to increase treatment coverage in DRC and Cote d'Ivoire through mobile phone messaging.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that SCI considers innovative, location-specific strategies, like mobile phone messaging, to boost treatment coverage. Adapting intervention methods based on local characteristics can optimize expenditures and enhance cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-09-08 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI develops a preventive chemotherapy plan with each country in order to create a projection of the number of treatments that each country might request. SCI then looks at these countries' actual treatment and budget requests to determine the total funding need for the year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process that tailors intervention strategies based on the local requirements and treatment demands of each country. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, adapting funding and treatment allocation based on specific country characteristics implies a mechanism for improving resource allocation and, therefore, cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Approximately 75-80% of all treatments are administered to children, but this varies by country. SCI's programs are primarily focusing on morbidity control, and these programs primarily target children. However, in areas where the prevalence and intensity of infection is particularly high, WHO advises treating the entire population rather than exclusively children. In areas that are moving toward elimination of schistosomiasis, the percentage of treatments delivered to children is lower. Current research shows that in order to eliminate the disease, it will be necessary to increase coverage to include community-based treatments in addition to school-based treatments.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that SCI adjusts its intervention strategies based on local epidemiological conditions, shifting between a cost-effective school-based approach and broader community-based interventions when necessary. This adaptation highlights how tailoring strategies to each location’s characteristics can impact the overall cost effectiveness of the program.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** When considering a request to expand to a new country, SCI examines several factors, including need, capacity, and political will. Staffing is an important concern, as the SCI staff is currently working at full capacity. To start a new program, SCI would need to hire at least one program manager.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI tailors its intervention strategies to the unique characteristics of each location by assessing local need, capacity, and political will. Such location-specific evaluation helps ensure that resources are deployed where they are most effective, which can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Sometimes, SCI is unable to provide as much funding as a country program requests. When this happens, the program manager might choose to reduce the number of planned treatments. Alternatively, SCI might request modifications to areas that could withstand some cost-cutting measures without reducing the number of planned treatments. Program managers would then discuss the modifications with country program staff and propose a reduced budget. Though budget trimming is often necessary, it can appear harsh and have negative consequences on SCI's relationships with program managers.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process where SCI adapts its intervention strategies—by reducing treatment numbers or modifying plans—when faced with funding constraints. Such adaptive measures help align program delivery with available resources, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Every August, African countries submit a request for the number of PZQ tablets they require for schistosomiasis treatment programs. Stakeholders meet in October or November to assess these requests and decide on allocations, taking into account PZQ availability. In 2015, countries requested a total of 140 million tablets, and Merck provided 105 million tablets. In 2016, donations will increase to 250 million tablets. A country's capacity to undertake successful treatment programs is a primary consideration. Requests from countries partnering with organizations such as SCI are more likely to be approved. Those with inadequate financial backing might receive fewer than they request.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how SCI’s operational process for allocating donated drug tablets is adapted to the local context by considering each country’s capacity and financial backing. Tailoring the allocation in this way helps ensure that resources are efficiently utilized, which is a key component of cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** SCI works with governments in sub-Saharan Africa to create or scale up mass drug administration programs (MDAs) for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), particularly schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) in school-aged children and other groups determined to be at high risk. SCI's role has primarily been to identify country recipients, provide funding to governments for government-implemented programs, provide advisory support, and conduct research on the process and outcomes of the programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights SCI’s operational approach of partnering with local governments to implement interventions. By identifying country-specific recipients and relying on government-led programs, SCI tailors its strategy based on local conditions. This adaptive process leverages local administrative capacity and context-specific knowledge, which can lower overheads and enhance resource allocation, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI's model involves both (a) employing staff for program management, technical assistance, and capacity building and (b) funding governments to carry out infection mapping and treatment programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the dual strategy of central oversight combined with decentralized, locally driven implementation. By investing in capacity building and supporting government-run activities such as infection mapping, SCI adapts its interventions to the unique needs and characteristics of each location. This tailored operational process is likely to optimize treatment delivery and reduce costs, bolstering cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While it is our understanding that SCI's programs generally target areas that require mass treatment according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the disease burden in SCI areas is on average lower than in the study areas, so our expectation is that the average impact per child treated is lower in SCI areas. We adjust our cost-effectiveness analysis accordingly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI and its evaluators take local epidemiological differences into account when assessing program impact. By adjusting their cost-effectiveness analysis to reflect lower disease burdens in certain areas, they indirectly acknowledge that intervention strategies are adapted to local conditions. Such tailored adjustments in planning and evaluation support more accurate and efficient resource use, thereby contributing to cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** The World Health Organization recommends annual treatment for schistosomiasis and twice-annual treatment for soil-transmitted helminths for preschool- and school-aged children in areas with prevalence above 50%. In areas with lower prevalence, the World Health Organization recommends less frequent deworming.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that adapts intervention frequency based on local infection prevalence (a key characteristic of each location). By tailoring treatment schedules to reinfection risks, the strategy aims to use resources more efficiently, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The World Health Organization's recommendations about which groups of people to treat also vary with prevalence; in low-prevalence areas, treatment is restricted to preschool- and school-aged children and certain categories of adults.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that intervention strategies are modified based on local epidemiological data, selecting target populations according to specific location characteristics. Such adaptation can improve cost effectiveness by focusing resources on the groups most affected.

### Doc Name: 2011-10-18 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** In Malawi SCI is planning a stratified survey to determine whether it is possible/desirable to implement at below-district level based on ecological differences within districts. The goal of mapping is to provide a cost-effective way to determine how much treatment is needed and the frequency of treatment required.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational process where the charity adapts its intervention strategy to local ecological differences through stratified mapping, ensuring that treatment is matched to local needs, thereby improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Yemen, SCI distinguishes between high, medium and low prevalence areas. In high prevalence areas, the Yemen programme treats the whole population for three years and children for five years. In medium prevalence areas, the whole population is treated once, then children every other year. In low prevalence areas, the children are treated every other year. 30 million treatments total are anticipated.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that the charity tailors its treatment frequency and scope based on the local prevalence of schistosomiasis, an adaptation that likely contributes to cost effectiveness by aligning resources with need.

- **Quote:** Prof. Fenwick said this issue was likely due to lack of eating before taking PZQ; he noted that those carrying out mass drug administration should coordinate with school feeding programs when possible, and when this wasn't possible, should provide some food or at least use social mobilization to make sure kids know to eat first. He stated, "An upset stomach is a good sign, it means the PZQ is working, but vomiting is not, it means the PZQ is wasted."
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational adjustment—coordinating drug administration with school feeding programs—to prevent drug wastage. By adapting to local nutritional circumstances, the intervention aims to conserve resources and enhance cost effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Prior to treatment, we support in-country Ministries of Health to assess the prevalence* of infection.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that data on the prevalence of infection is collected before the intervention, which is foundational for informing where resources are best allocated and how to plan treatment strategically for cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Our biostatisticians develop risk maps, detailing predicted levels of infection across endemic areas.
- **Reasoning:** The transformation of collected data into risk maps indicates a systematic process of analyzing pre-intervention data, which informs operational decisions by identifying high-risk areas and aiding in the targeted deployment of treatment.

- **Quote:** These maps show which areas require treatment and how often to distribute treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the analysis (risk maps) directly to operational planning by indicating that pre-intervention data determines both geographic targeting and the frequency of treatment, key aspects of ensuring cost effective use of resources.

- **Quote:** Schools, and children attending them, are randomly selected to provide samples to test levels of infection before and after treatment. To determine how often treatment will be needed in an area, the risk level is assessed based on prevalence of infection and according to the World Health Organization guidelines.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the methodology for sample collection before treatment, explaining how baseline data is used to assess risk levels and inform future treatment strategies, underscoring the operational benefit of pre-intervention data collection.

### Doc Name: 2014-05-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** At baseline (in 2004), each of the sentinel schools were sampled by a team from the research lab who arrived in the morning to take samples from 150 students selected at random, which were then taken back to the lab for analysis. In the afternoon, one or two lab staff remained at the school to supervise the deworming drug administration and to ensure that all students in the school were treated.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the pre-intervention data collection process at sentinel schools, showing that baseline sampling (conducted before the deworming treatment) is integrated into the operational process. This design helps in accurately assessing the initial conditions, which in turn can inform efficient allocation of resources, a key element in a cost-effective intervention.

- **Quote:** Statistical power calculations were performed to ensure that the correct number of schools and children per school were sampled to be representative of all schools receiving the same treatment strategy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how pre-intervention data collection is methodically planned using statistical power calculations. By determining the optimal sample size beforehand, the operational process is designed to avoid wastage of resources and to achieve representative data, thereby contributing to cost-effective program implementation.

- **Quote:** Each year prior to treatment 250 people are sampled (100 l* year students; 100 9-12 year olds; and 50 adults) with the aim of monitoring the impact of drug intensity on infection patterns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an ongoing pre-intervention data collection practice within the SCORE study. Sampling is conducted before each treatment cycle to monitor infection patterns, a process which supports the adjustment and optimization of the intervention regime—thereby indirectly enhancing the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the charitable program.

### Doc Name: 2014-11-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Disease mapping in the country found less _S. haematobium_ than expected, but fairly high levels of _S. mansoni_. The prevalence of STHs was very high and has convinced the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) to put more attention on STHs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how baseline data collection (disease mapping) provided critical insights into disease prevalence, which in turn informed operational decisions regarding resource allocation and program focus, thereby contributing to cost-effective intervention planning.

- **Quote:** SCI funded treatments based on older disease prevalence data and supported nationwide mapping.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-existing, collected data was leveraged to make funding and treatment decisions, underscoring the role of pre-intervention data collection in shaping operational processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It was interested in doing disease mapping but did not have the funding to do so, and it likely would not have received drug donations without the mapping data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the availability of pre-intervention data (through disease mapping) was essential for securing necessary resources such as drug donations, highlighting the practical impact of data collection on operational cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** Due to ethical considerations, it was important to treat people relatively quickly after mapping data had confirmed infections so treatments began in places that were mapped before the rest of the country had been mapped.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention mapping data was used to determine where to initiate treatments quickly, indicating that early data collection directly informs operational decisions, which is a key factor in enabling cost-effective program implementation.

- **Quote:** SCI conducted national mapping since late 2012, finishing in March 2014. In total, all 82 districts in Cote d'Ivoire were mapped. This was done in two phases because of limited funding. The first phase was done by the Ministry of Health with support from SCI.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights a systematic pre-intervention data collection process (mapping) that segmented the country into manageable districts. The phased mapping approach allowed SCI to prioritize areas and allocate resources strategically, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Data is entered at the country level. For example, data from mapping and sentinel sites can be handled by students at a local university. The data is double entered to ensure accuracy. The original forms stay in the country and the database is sent to SCI, which can then run analyses.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes the operational practices for ensuring data quality and accuracy from early data collection efforts. Such systematic processing of pre-intervention data is crucial for effective decision-making and efficient use of resources, underscoring its role in maintaining cost-effective operations.

### Doc Name: 2016-02-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI's annual budgeting process occurs in March. Each of SCI's country programs produces a plan predicting its treatment numbers for the next three years. (These projections are later refined annually based on more up-to-date epidemiological data.) Each program submits a detailed work plan and budget request based on these projections.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that before executing interventions, SCI collects predictive data—treatment number forecasts based on epidemiological insights—which are used to prepare work plans and budget requests. This pre-intervention planning process informs operational decisions that can contribute to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-06-20 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** During the study, researchers tested students at sentinel schools for schistosomiasis in mid-May every year. Researchers did not provide treatment to any students. Students in sentinel schools were supposed to receive schistosomiasis treatment at their schools as part of the Burundian government's annual mass drug administration (MDA) in mid-June.
- **Reasoning:** This quote clearly illustrates that data was collected prior to the intervention (the mass drug administration). Although the text doesn’t explicitly link this baseline data collection to how SCI adjusts its operational processes for cost effectiveness, gathering unbiased pre-intervention data is a critical step that can inform later operational decisions such as targeting and resource allocation.

- **Quote:** It is unclear whether the treatment team knew which schools were sentinel schools. Researchers visiting the sentinel schools would have been highly visible, so teachers, students, and people living nearby likely knew if a school was a sentinel school.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational detail concerning the handling of pre-intervention data. The potential awareness of sentinel schools by local stakeholders implies that how and when data is collected (and who has access to it) may affect the execution of subsequent interventions. While it doesn’t explicitly discuss cost effectiveness, it suggests that managing the flow of pre-intervention information is an operational process that could have implications for unbiased and efficient intervention delivery.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** This is due in part to the recent completion of a two-year, PS1 million project, funded by SCI, to map the entire country at the _woreda_ (district) level. SCI now has a better understanding of where STH and schistosomiasis treatment are needed in Ethiopia.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of pre-intervention data collection—in this case, a detailed mapping project—that enabled SCI to identify areas with high treatment needs. The resulting insight informed SCI's operational planning and budget allocation, thereby contributing to more cost-effective treatment strategies.

- **Quote:** SCI received a PS200,000 grant from a private donor to conduct mapping in Madagascar and begin arranging for treatment using donated PZQ that was about to expire.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that SCI conducted mapping to collect essential data before launching treatment programs. The pre-intervention data collection in Madagascar helped guide decisions on where and how to deploy resources and arrange treatments, ensuring that the organization uses its funds and donated supplies in a cost-effective manner.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Prior to SCI's involvement in 2010, there was a mapping project in 2008. Dr. Blair does not think there were any schistosomiasis (SCH) treatment programs (other than a small program funded by SCI). If there were, they would have been small-scale. Mapping was done partly by SCI and partly by a local organization. It was overseen by Yaobi Zhang, who was working for SCI and now works for Helen Keller International.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that data was collected before the intervention in the form of a mapping project, establishing baseline information about SCH prevalence. Such pre-intervention data is critical for planning, as it forms the basis upon which operational processes can be designed to ensure cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** There have been some issues with communication and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). For example, in a previous treatment round, the CNTD program manager reported to SCI that there would be 10 million SCH treatments. Later, SCI learned that there were only 6 million SCH treatments. This was the correct number of treatments to give based on the prevalence data found during mapping, but the praziquantel (PZQ) supplied was much greater than what was actually needed and this caused issues with SCI's reporting to DFID. The excess PZQ will be used next year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the pre-intervention mapping data directly to operational decision-making by showing that the correct treatment numbers were derived from the baseline data. The discrepancy between reported and actual treatment numbers highlights the role of accurate, pre-intervention data in optimizing resource allocation and cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-04-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Using a set of weighted criteria, SCI ranks countries based on the approximate level of effort required to implement programs. With this information, SCI is able to identify appropriate country pairings and allocate reasonably sized workloads among program managers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how SCI employs data (via weighted criteria) prior to launching programs to assess the implementation effort required in different countries. By using this pre-intervention analysis to inform the allocation of workloads and pairing of countries, SCI’s operational process aims to efficiently manage resources, which is a key component of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Figures and treatment numbers in the initial versions of SCI's annual budgets are based on an optimal situation. They are refined as new information becomes available regarding:
* Drug availability in country and in the market; for example, there can be frequent shortages of praziquantel.
* Epidemiological mapping results.
* Opportunities for cost-sharing with other funders.
* The program delivery capacity of the country's Ministry of Health (MoH).
* The success of SCI's fundraising efforts.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that SCI’s budgeting process—an essential operational mechanism—is initially set up with optimistic assumptions and then adjusted based on collected data. The incorporation of data such as epidemiological mapping results and drug availability (gathered before interventions) helps refine operational plans, ensuring that resource allocation is aligned with real-world conditions, thereby supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-04-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI conducts disease mapping in the countries it works in to determine the number of treatments needed and the most appropriate mapping strategy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre‐intervention data collection activity—disease mapping—which informs SCI about treatment needs and helps shape strategies. Such baseline information is vital for operational planning and ensuring that interventions are targeted cost effectively.

- **Quote:** To determine how to allocate funding from DFID and unrestricted funding across the countries it works in, SCI considers:

* Cost per treatment in each country. Cost per treatment tends to be lower in larger countries that are treating at national scale, countries that are at a later stage of the program, and countries where funding is available from other sources (which increases opportunities for collaboration and cost sharing). SCI believes that allocating unrestricted funds to countries with lower cost per treatment helps to demonstrate that its program is a highly cost effective intervention. (SCI also appreciates that there are countries with great need that have no program in place, and which, therefore, may have higher costs.) For example, SCI has allocated unrestricted funds to Mozambique, a large country with a national scale program, because it has some USAID funding for other NTD programs, so there is a lower cost per treatment in the country.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines how quantitative data—specifically, cost per treatment metrics likely derived from pre-intervention analysis—guides the allocation of funds. By using such data, SCI can allocate resources in a manner that maximizes cost effectiveness, linking operational decisions directly to early, baseline measurements.

- **Quote:** Data collection has increased under the DFID grant. For example, SCI is now conducting coverage validation surveys in most DFID-funded countries. It did not collect this information previously, so earlier data does not exist.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly notes the absence of pre-intervention coverage data, underscoring how the lack of baseline data previously limited operational insights. The subsequent initiation of such data collection suggests that having pre-intervention data is recognized as essential for later validating program performance and ensuring cost effective operations.

### Doc Name: 2016-04-06 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In October 2015, SCI shared estimates for its April 2016-March 2017 budget year with GiveWell on target treatment numbers by country, amounts of funding available from DFID and other large donors, and the amounts of additional funding required to deliver the targeted number of treatments in each country and cover SCI's central expenditures (http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/SCI/SCI planned SCH treatment numbe rs by country by year (October 2015).xlsx).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI collected and shared quantitative data (target treatment numbers and funding estimates) before the intervention period. Such pre-intervention data is used to inform operational planning and budget allocation, which are essential components of achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI uses target treatment figures for schistosomiasis from WHO when making country treatment plans. There are gaps in the disease prevalence mapping data WHO currently uses to create these estimates, but updated estimates, which will incorporate mapping data collected over the past few years funded through a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as mapping data collected by SCI and other deworming organizations, will likely be available within a few months.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how pre-intervention data – specifically disease prevalence mapping data and WHO target treatment figures – informs the planning process. By relying on and updating this foundational data, SCI refines its operational strategy, a practice that underpins cost effective deployment of interventions.

### Doc Name: 2015-09-08 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI develops a preventive chemotherapy plan with each country in order to create a projection of the number of treatments that each country might request. SCI then looks at these countries' actual treatment and budget requests to determine the total funding need for the year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention planning activity where SCI collects data from each country—through treatment projections and budget requests—to determine its funding needs. By using this collected data to plan resource allocation, SCI is able to streamline its operational processes, which can contribute to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The remaining treatments were rescheduled for April 2015, but these have not yet taken place due to a university partner's delay in taking baseline measurements at some sentinel sites. As soon as these measurements have been taken, about 1 million additional treatments will be administered.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention data collection activity (baseline measurements at sentinel sites) that is essential for scheduling and planning future treatments. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, it implies that collecting accurate baseline data informs operational decisions and timing, which can contribute to efficient, cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** Every August, African countries submit a request for the number of PZQ tablets they require for schistosomiasis treatment programs. Stakeholders meet in October or November to assess these requests and decide on allocations, taking into account PZQ availability.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a systematic pre-intervention data collection process where countries provide detailed information on their treatment needs. The subsequent analysis and decision-making on tablet allocations reflects an operational process that uses early data to plan and execute interventions in a resource-efficient (and thus potentially cost-effective) manner.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** We have seen baseline data on the prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and STH infections for countries that account for about three‐quarters of the treatments SCI has delivered in recent years. Schistosomiasis and STH prevalence and intensity in these countries was generally fairly low compared to the studies providing the best evidence for the benefits of deworming (Croke 2014 and Miguel and Kremer 2004).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI collects pre‐intervention baseline data on disease burden. The information on infection prevalence before treatments informs their cost‐effectiveness analyses by allowing them to compare local disease levels with those in key studies, thereby guiding operational planning and resource allocation.

- **Quote:** In general, mass deworming programs treat everyone in a targeted demographic, regardless of whether each individual is infected (more). Because of this, the benefits (and therefore the cost‐effectiveness) of a program are highly dependent on the baseline prevalence of worm infections. … We adjust our cost‐effectiveness analysis accordingly.
- **Reasoning:** This passage explains that pre‐intervention data—specifically, the baseline prevalence of worm infections—is critical in assessing program benefits. As such, this data directly influences the operational processes (like targeting and budgeting) and the overall cost‐effectiveness strategy of the charity.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Supplementary Information.md
- **Quote:** SCI conducted a coverage survey following this round of treatment and collected baseline data on infection rates from 22 sentinel schools prior to the treatment round (more on these data collection methods below).
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates the collection of pre-intervention baseline data on infection rates in Ethiopia. Such baseline data are crucial for operational planning—informing treatment targeting and resource allocation—which underpins cost-effective program design.

- **Quote:** SCI's program manager for Uganda describes her role as (as of October 2014) assisting with budgets and plans, talking to the government regularly (largely through email) leading up to an MDA to make sure all the components are prepared, traveling to the country to oversee collection of prevalence and intensity data prior to an MDA, following up with the government after an MDA to get the data needed for reporting to DFID, and participating in activity reviews after each stage of the program (for example, after an MDA and after monitoring and evaluation activities).
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the integral role of pre-intervention data collection (e.g., prevalence and intensity data before a mass drug administration) in operational processes. The data are used in budgeting and planning, ensuring that the charity’s interventions are well-prepared and thus more likely to be cost effective.

### Doc Name: 2011-10-18 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Dr Maria Rebollo (ICOSA M and E Manager) discussed plans for evaluating the program, with a goal of showing its success so that more money can be raised in the future. She stated that they're collecting baseline data for outcomes including coverage (which they consider the main outcome of interest, since treatment with PZQ is already proven to be effective), prevalence of infection, intensity of infection, anemia and improved heights and weights (growth).
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the pre-intervention collection of baseline data, which is intended to establish key outcome metrics. The data will not only help in the evaluation of the program's success but also inform operational decisions in terms of resource allocation, thereby promoting cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI representative Charlotte Gower and I discussed mapping. This school was surveyed in 2007 using microscopy. What this means is that they inspect urine under a microscope for eggs. If they see one egg, they mark the child as having schistosomiasis and move on - it takes longer (and is thus more expensive) to gauge how heavy the schistosomiasis is, which would require looking at all the slides and counting the eggs. They can also look for blood in the urine using a dipstick (except in severe cases, this blood is not visible to the naked eye but can be detected by dipstick) and this is easier but it's a higher infection intensity threshold since not everyone with eggs in the urine has blood in the urine. The WHO recommends surveying 10 schools / 50 kids per school, per target area (in Malawi a "target area" is a district since the terrain is pretty homogenous, but in other countries they might divide it up more); SCI might survey 20 schools instead. The sample sizes are being calculated by a senior SCI biostatistician, in order to develop a robust estimate of prevalence, with confidence limits, to allow treatment decisions to be taken. In Malawi SCI is planning a stratified survey to determine whether it is possible/desirable to implement at below-district level based on ecological differences within districts. The goal of mapping is to provide a cost-effective way to determine how much treatment is needed and the frequency of treatment required.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details the mapping process, which is a form of pre-intervention data collection. It explains how detailed surveys (including sample size calculations and stratified surveys) are used to accurately estimate disease prevalence. These estimates directly inform treatment decisions—such as how much medication is required and how often treatments should occur—thereby contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Using pilot projects: Using trial projects when the charity enters a new location.
### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** SCI recommended that the program start in only one province, where transportation would not be as difficult, so that it could make sure the program is done well and can assess the costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that when entering new locations—in this case, DRC—SCI intentionally challenges itself with a limited pilot approach by starting in a province with favorable conditions. This strategy enables the organization to fine-tune its operational processes and evaluate cost effectiveness before scaling up, directly addressing the research question.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** There has been more than one round of treatment. First, a pilot in one area was done and then scaled up to remaining areas of the country. Later, another large scale treatment round was done. A third round of treatment is scheduled for the next 6 months.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly indicates that a pilot project was implemented as an initial phase in a new location (Mozambique) before scaling up. It suggests that pilot projects are used to test and refine operational processes, which can potentially lead to improved cost effectiveness by minimizing risks before full-scale implementation.

- **Quote:** The Malawi program started as a pilot and was expected to scale up slowly, but quickly got to 100% coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that initiating a program with a pilot phase can yield rapid and successful results, as seen in Malawi. The quick achievement of 100% coverage implies that operational processes were effectively optimized during the pilot, thereby potentially enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** There was no coverage survey for the 2013 treatment because it was a pilot, and there were time-pressures to distribute the PZQ tablets before they expired.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that a pilot project was implemented (the 2013 treatment) which influenced operational processes by leading to the omission of a coverage survey due to time constraints. It illustrates an early-stage test that shaped operational decisions when entering a new context.

- **Quote:** With funding from Dubai Cares, the Partnership for Child Development (PCD) implemented a small pilot program in 30 schools in the southern region (SNNPR) to look at feasibility of a comprehensive school health and nutrition program, which includes deworming, nutrition, and WASH interventions and home-grown school-feeding. Related to this, the grant included funding for a region-wide situational analysis, covering an area with about 17 million people.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of a pilot project used to assess the feasibility of an integrated health program in a new area. Such pilot projects can inform and refine operational strategies and potentially contribute to enhanced cost-effectiveness by testing approaches on a smaller scale before full-scale implementation.

### Doc Name: 2015-10-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In Nigeria, SCI estimates that it will spend about $0.40 per treatment because its program is in the start-up phase and it expects additional expenses. An official from the Nigerian Ministry of Health has proposed three states for SCI to work in, which have had no previous schistosomiasis treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights SCI’s experience with entering a new location where its program is in the start-up phase—a condition akin to a pilot project. The higher per-treatment cost underscores how new interventions may involve additional expenses, thereby drawing attention to potential impacts on overall cost effectiveness and operational processes.

- **Quote:** If SCI does not meet its fundraising goals, it would eliminate its new Nigeria program first.
- **Reasoning:** This quote suggests that the new Nigeria program, which reflects characteristics of a pilot project in an unfamiliar setting, is viewed as riskier and more expendable compared to established programs. This decision-making process underscores how pilot projects are utilized to test new operational environments while also posing challenges to cost effectiveness if financial conditions are not favorable.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** The ones in Cote d'Ivoire are pilot projects and we have used the results there to prepare the national plans and train people.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI employs pilot projects in new locations to test and refine their operational strategies. The results from these pilot projects inform the creation of national plans and the training of personnel, which can improve the efficiency of scaling up interventions and potentially lead to better cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** While Mr. Gastfriend is open to the idea of IDinsight providing monitoring services for both MDAs, he would prefer that IDinsight's first monitoring activity focused on one project. This would allow IDinsight to use the results to design future monitoring activities in other locations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly suggests a pilot approach where the initial project acts as a test case. The results are intended to inform and shape future monitoring practices as the charity expands to new locations, linking to the research question on improving operational processes and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The Ethiopia project seems to be the most appropriate candidate for IDinsight monitoring services. Though IDinsight's transportation costs would be higher due to the country's large size, Ethiopia's stakeholder environment is less complex, and this project is more representative of SCI's work in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the strategic selection of a pilot project based on operational factors such as stakeholder complexity and overall representativeness, which can contribute to refining operational processes and achieving cost effectiveness in future locations.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** In October 2017, SCI estimated that it would cost _E_0.18 on average per additional treatment delivered to a school-aged child, or about $0.24 USD at the exchange rate at the time. It estimated _E_0.27 per child in the first year of a new country program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote implies that entering a new location—effectively a pilot phase—incurs higher per-child costs due to initial startup activities (e.g., advocacy, mapping). Such extra costs are factored into overall cost-effectiveness analyses, suggesting that pilot projects serve as an initial learning phase that impacts the charity’s operational processes and cost structure.

- **Quote:** We prefer to have a broadly representative selection of treatments in order to mitigate possible distortions, such as using data from a new program, which may incur costs from advocacy, mapping, etc. before it has delivered any treatments.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights that data from new programs—akin to pilot projects—can be distorted by extra start-up expenses. Acknowledging these additional operational costs underscores how pilot phases contribute to refining processes and understanding actual cost-effectiveness once the program scales.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Supplementary Information.md
- **Quote:** PCD funded mapping in part of the country and delivered treatments in a pilot program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote, found in the Ethiopia section, explicitly describes a pilot project undertaken when SCI entered a new location that previously had no sustained schistosomiasis program. Although it does not directly discuss cost effectiveness, the pilot project is implied to serve as a trial mechanism for testing mapping and treatment delivery methods, thereby potentially informing improved operational processes that could lead to more cost‐effective scaling in the future.

## Code: Enhancing capabilities of local stakeholders: Improving the ability of local partners to conduct the intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 3.md
- **Quote:** We improve processes and support governments to develop preferred practices for global health policy and to strengthen systems overall.
- **Reasoning:** This statement indicates that the charity actively engages in process improvement and capacity-building by supporting governments. While the term 'governments' is used rather than 'local partners', this can be interpreted as enhancing the operational capabilities of local entities responsible for interventions, thereby contributing to cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** We believe in people and in unlocking their full potential. We are committed to developing everyone involved in our work, as people are our greatest asset.
- **Reasoning:** This reflects an ethos of empowerment and capacity development. Even though it does not specifically reference local partners or intervention activities, it aligns with operational processes aimed at enhancing the capabilities of those involved, which could include local partners, ultimately supporting cost-effective implementations.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 7.md
- **Quote:** Professor Alan Fenwick. The grant allowed the SCI to provide a proof-of-concept for national-scale schistosomiasis programmes. It assisted the Ministries of Health and Education to deliver treatment for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in 6 countries, targeting school-age children and adults at high risk of infection. O-- 2006
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that SCI leveraged grant funding to launch a proof-of-concept for national-scale interventions, explicitly noting that it assisted local partners (Ministries of Health and Education) in delivering treatments. This involvement of local government agencies suggests an operational process aimed at enhancing local partners’ capacities, which can be an important mechanism for achieving cost effectiveness, even though the document does not directly mention cost savings.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 1.md
- **Quote:** The medication is administered in our partner ministry of health programmes by local teachers and volunteers known as community drug distributors (CDDs).
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly shows an operational process where the charity empowers local partners—teachers and community volunteers—to administer treatments, which is a key aspect of enhancing local capabilities and may contribute to cost effectiveness by leveraging community resources.

- **Quote:** Since our foundation in 2002, we've helped establish programmes against parasitic worm infections in countries where none previously existed, and now support the delivery of millions of treatments each year through a strong partnership with Ministries of Health.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity builds long-term operational partnerships with local Ministries of Health to deliver large-scale interventions. Such processes enhance local capacity and can lead to improved efficiency and cost effective implementation.

### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Prior to treatment, we support in-country Ministries of Health to assess the prevalence* of infection.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity actively engages local partners (Ministries of Health) in pre-intervention assessments. By supporting these assessments, the charity enhances the local partners' capacity to gather accurate epidemiological data, which is essential for targeted interventions and can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Reassessment surveys allow a broader and more robust assessment of the impact of a programme following several rounds of treatment and provide the data that MoHs need to determine future treatment strategies.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the use of reassessment surveys as an ongoing operational tool that feeds back into decision-making by in-country Ministries of Health. By continuously informing future treatment strategies, these processes enhance partner capabilities and contribute to more cost-effective intervention planning.

- **Quote:** Uses evidence from operational research initiatives to design and evaluate behavioural change interventions, in collaboration with partners.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates how operational research is employed collaboratively with local partners to design and refine behavioural interventions. Enhancing partner capacity in this way supports adaptive, efficient programming that is likely to yield cost-effective results.

### Doc Name: 2014-05-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For the non-sentinel schools, the National Schistosomiasis and STH Control Program were responsible for coordinating the mass treatment for all schools in each district. Cascade training was carried out where teachers were trained at the district level on how to administer the deworming drugs. The teachers in turn were responsible for treating the children with supervision from district level health staff. The district level health staff were in turn trained and supervised by the central level Ministry of Health.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process in which local partners—teachers, district health staff, and the Ministry of Health—are systematically trained and mobilized to deliver treatments. This cascade training approach enhances local capacity to conduct interventions, which can lower implementation costs by utilizing existing local structures instead of relying on external personnel. While the passage does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness outcomes, it implies that leveraging local resources through structured training supports a cost‐effective delivery model.

- **Reasoning:** This direct declaration of capacity building highlights a core operational process where SCI invests in training local staff across various disciplines. Empowering local teams in these areas reduces reliance on external experts and drives down costs, thus supporting the charity’s cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-06-20 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Students in sentinel schools were supposed to receive schistosomiasis treatment at their schools as part of the Burundian government's annual mass drug administration (MDA) in mid-June. The MDA was part of Mother-and-Child Health Week, a national program in Burundi that delivered vaccines and other medical interventions. The treatment delivery system was the same throughout the country, including in regions containing sentinel schools.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how the intervention was integrated into an existing government-run program, utilizing standardized, countrywide operational processes. By leveraging the established Mother-and-Child Health Week and its local delivery system, the process exemplifies how engaging local partners can minimize extra costs and potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, there was little overlap between the team leading the study and treatment teams, because the people leading the study worked for the central government, while the treatment teams consisted of workers from district health centers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of local partners—in this case, the district health center workers—in executing the intervention. Relying on local teams to carry out treatment can improve efficiency and reduce operational costs, aligning with the research question on how empowering local partners through operational processes can enable cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Partnerships with local NGOs on funds distribution

In certain countries where the national ministries of health lack sufficient capacity, Ms. Labry has identified reliable local NGOs that will accept and distribute SCI's funds into their bank accounts. SCI will pay for a local accountant or account assistant who will work in the NGO's office, collecting and distributing SCI's funds. SCI will also pay 5-6% of the NGO's local office overhead. This is a more cost-effective solution than establishing offices in all of SCI's countries. So far, SCI has implemented this system in DRC, Cote d'Ivoire, and Tanzania, and it hopes to gradually begin implementing it in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a specific operational process where SCI leverages the capabilities of local NGOs to manage fund distribution, thereby enhancing local partners' capacity and achieving cost-effectiveness by avoiding the higher costs associated with establishing new offices.

### Doc Name: 2015-12-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some countries, such as Madagascar and Niger, rather than transfer funds directly to the MoH, they are sent through in-country non-governmental organization (NGO) partners who verify program activity logs before releasing the funds. (This process was also being set up in Tanzania when Ms. Labry was leaving SCI.) NGOs tend to have better accounting systems in place, as well as staff trained in grant monitoring.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where SCI leverages local NGO partners to manage financial controls and verify program activity. By enhancing the local partners' ability to conduct intervention oversight, SCI potentially reduces risks such as fraud and inefficiencies, contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

The process of obtaining feedback and adjusting operations based on local needs enhances partner capacity and responsiveness. Such an approach can improve the efficiency of intervention delivery, which is an important factor in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The funds are delivered straight to an account where Ugandan officials have access. There are two signatories, and the account requires both signatories to sign off on purchases. SCI's finance manager can monitor this account. A government accountant reports to SCI monthly and provides receipts and other spending details. This setup provides SCI with good visibility on spending. It probably would be politically difficult to create an account like this today, but it has been allowed to persist in the form it was set up.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt details an operational process that grants local officials direct access to funds while maintaining oversight through dual signatories and regular reporting. By enhancing the capacity of local financial management, SCI ensures transparent and timely expenditure, thereby minimizing waste and promoting cost-effective use of resources.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** We don't actually employ anybody in Africa because I believe strongly that the program should belong to the Africans. If you were to put an American expatriate in a country it would probably cost nearly $500,000 a year to sustain that person, they would end up running the program, and the local African people would not have ownership.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights SCI's deliberate choice to empower local partners by ensuring that the program is locally owned. By avoiding the high cost of expatriate staff, SCI enhances local capabilities and reduces operational expenses, directly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI staff don't only conduct monitoring and evaluation. They also act as a catalyst, and provide assistance whenever a government requests it. Assistance can include technical help, managerial help, or auditing help.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that SCI's operational processes include offering direct support to local governments through technical, managerial, and auditing expertise. This empowerment of local partners in conducting interventions enhances their capacity and, in turn, the cost effectiveness of the charity's efforts.

- **Quote:** Governments generally provide in-kind support for the programs, not funding. They provide such things as staff salaries, office space and vehicles, while we provide fuel, maintenance, and staff per diems.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational model where SCI leverages local resources by relying on governments for in-kind support. This collaboration builds local capacity for intervention delivery and contributes to overall cost effectiveness by minimizing external expenditures.

- **Quote:** In Mali, we handed the program over to the NGO Helen Keller, which has continued the program.

By assisting with planning, budgeting, and technical oversight—as well as by directly funding and delivering resources—SCI improves the local partners' ability to execute interventions efficiently, thereby contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the programs.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Supplementary Information.md
- **Quote:** SCI's Program Manager for Cote d'Ivoire described her role (as of October 2014) as providing technical expertise, helping create budgets, monitoring training and MDAs, responding to problems (for example, surveying health workers to understand low coverage of non-enrolled children, and advising on how to proceed with the program during a security threat), refining the protocol for the coverage survey, and coordinating with partners for integrated MDAs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a range of operational processes—technical support, budget creation, monitoring, and problem-solving—that SCI uses to support local partners. By enhancing the local partners’ ability to manage aspects of the intervention (e.g., MDAs and surveys), these processes likely contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring efficient allocation of resources and reducing the need for sustained external oversight.

- **Quote:** SCI's Program Manager for Ethiopia described his role (as of October 2014) as assisting with initial program set up and funder agreements, drafting detailed plans for the next 12 months and general plans for the next 5 years, and providing technical assistance for mapping and some guidance on MDA implementation. At the time, he lived in the country and worked closely with the government NTD team.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how SCI embeds its staff within the local context to build operational capacity among local partners. The close collaboration on program setup, planning, and technical assistance helps local partners to conduct interventions effectively, which can reduce implementation costs and contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI told us that, due to strong in-country capacity, SCI provides only limited technical assistance for MDA. Instead, SCI's technical assistance in the country is focused on operational research on how best to move toward elimination of schistosomiasis. SCI's program manager for Uganda describes her role as (as of October 2014) assisting with budgets and plans, talking to the government regularly (largely through email) leading up to an MDA to make sure all the components are prepared, traveling to the country to oversee collection of prevalence and intensity data prior to an MDA, following up with the government after an MDA to get the data needed for reporting to DFID, and participating in activity reviews after each stage of the program (for example, after an MDA and after monitoring and evaluation activities).
- **Reasoning:** In this quote, the emphasis is on leveraging strong local capacity such that SCI’s role becomes primarily supportive and research-oriented. This reduced reliance on external technical assistance implies that local partners are more capable of managing interventions, which can drive down program costs and enhance overall cost effectiveness.

By building on existing local partner capacity, the intervention minimizes additional delivery costs, contributing to overall cost‐effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2011-10-18 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** SCI representative Charlotte Gower and I discussed mapping. This school was surveyed in 2007 using microscopy. What this means is that they inspect urine under a microscope for eggs. If they see one egg, they mark the child as having schistosomiasis and move on - it takes longer (and is thus more expensive) to gauge how heavy the schistosomiasis is, which would require looking at all the slides and counting the eggs. They can also look for blood in the urine using a dipstick (except in severe cases, this blood is not visible to the naked eye but can be detected by dipstick) and this is easier but it's a higher infection intensity threshold since not everyone with eggs in the urine has blood in the urine. The WHO recommends surveying 10 schools / 50 kids per school, per target area (in Malawi a "target area" is a district since the terrain is pretty homogenous, but in other countries they might divide it up more); SCI might survey 20 schools instead. The sample sizes are being calculated by a senior SCI biostatistician, in order to develop a robust estimate of prevalence, with confidence limits, to allow treatment decisions to be taken. In Malawi SCI is planning a stratified survey to determine whether it is possible/desirable to implement at below-district level based on ecological differences within districts. The goal of mapping is to provide a cost-effective way to determine how much treatment is needed and the frequency of treatment required.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process (mapping and stratified survey) designed to assess epidemiological needs accurately, thereby informing treatment decisions in a cost-effective manner. Although it doesn't explicitly name local partners, it is a process managed by SCI in collaboration with local stakeholders, enhancing their capability to deliver targeted interventions.

- **Quote:** Per-diem costs (i.e., rewards to those who deliver the drugs) can be a significant part of the delivery costs: An example could be $10-20 for a one- or two-day training for teachers or health surveillance assistants. We estimated (informally) that these could be up to half of delivery costs and Prof. Fenwick said that sounded about right.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the operational cost structure, including investments in training local personnel (teachers and health surveillance assistants). By highlighting the training cost as a component of operational expenses, it supports the idea that enhancing the capabilities of local partners is factored into achieving overall cost effectiveness.

- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process involving local-level supervision and feedback from community teams. By engaging local stakeholders in verifying program performance, the process may ensure accurate reporting and accountability, which can indirectly contribute to cost effectiveness—though the text stops short of explicitly linking these operational steps to overall cost reductions.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** SCI plays an advisory role to the government and encourages them to have overall ownership of the program. The country decides the treatment plans, and SCI's program mangers provide technical expertise and help create budget requests alongside the Ministry of Health team.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that secures local stakeholder support by enabling government ownership and decision-making. By integrating local partners in planning and budgeting, the program leverages local resources (such as the government paying staff salaries) and potentially improves cost effectiveness through shared responsibility and reduced external spending.

- **Quote:** In DRC and Cote d'Ivoire, the program staff have been really receptive to guidance. A physical presence also helps build trust and coordinate with other partners in the country. They are very cautious about avoiding funding the same activity twice. It is easier to communicate and sort out problems when visiting the countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights another operational process—having key staff physically present to build trust and ensure coordination among local stakeholders. This engagement helps prevent redundant spending and promotes efficient communication, which in turn may contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In certain countries where the national ministries of health lack sufficient capacity, Ms. Labry has identified reliable local NGOs that will accept and distribute SCI's funds into their bank accounts. SCI will pay for a local accountant or account assistant who will work in the NGO's office, collecting and distributing SCI's funds. SCI will also pay 5-6% of the NGO's local office overhead. This is a more cost-effective solution than establishing offices in all of SCI's countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates an operational process that secures local stakeholder support—partnering with local NGOs—to handle fund distribution. It explicitly states that this process is more cost-effective compared to building separate offices, providing concrete evidence of how securing local stakeholder support contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-12-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In some countries, such as Madagascar and Niger, rather than transfer funds directly to the MoH, they are sent through in-country non-governmental organization (NGO) partners who verify program activity logs before releasing the funds. (This process was also being set up in Tanzania when Ms. Labry was leaving SCI.) NGOs tend to have better accounting systems in place, as well as staff trained in grant monitoring.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that explicitly leverages local stakeholder support by engaging in-country NGO partners. By having these local organizations verify program activity logs, SCI improves accountability and mitigates fraud risk—mechanisms that can contribute indirectly to overall cost effectiveness by ensuring funds are used efficiently.

- **Quote:** In Ethiopia, SCI hired an in-country finance manager to oversee the grant management process in collaboration with the government.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of another operational strategy in which local stakeholder support is secured through the appointment of an in-country finance manager. This role improves coordination with local government partners and enhances oversight of grant management, which likely leads to more efficient fund management and contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes.md

* Visit warehouses to inspect PZQ, and
* Manage M&E, which is often done through a separate independent entity such as a university instead of by the Ministry of Health.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details specific operational processes undertaken by SCI program managers to secure local stakeholder support (e.g., engaging senior Ministry of Health officials) which, while not directly mentioning cost effectiveness, implies that such procedural engagement helps ensure smooth operations and high treatment coverage that can lead to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Success in Uganda and Zanzibar has been due to strong leaders and buy-in within the country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links robust local stakeholder support and strong local leadership to program success. A well-supported program is likely to operate more efficiently and achieve high coverage, which in turn contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Zambia has had internal political issues and lack of strong buy-in. Previously, SCI stopped working there because the government was not providing the support that was needed. More recently, CNTD decided to work in Zambia supporting the government's effort to restart a SCH program as it thought it would be able to successfully manage a program there and was establishing a lymphatic filariasis (LF) program there at the same time. Managing the budget has been a challenge in Zambia. Per diem budgets are very high there. The program is broken into 2 ministries, which is unusual. SCI/CNTD are asked to provide support for two offices. Zambia has not yet completed a significant MDA, partly due to this political reshuffle. This means that the cost per treatment is poor because there have been few treatments despite the expenditures.
- **Reasoning:** This extended quote illustrates how a lack of local stakeholder support leads to operational difficulties that drive up the cost per treatment. The example of Zambia contrasts with the successful models elsewhere, emphasizing that securing local buy-in is crucial for cost-effective program implementation.

- **Quote:** Dr. French has been living in Ethiopia, which has helped him build relationships, enabled him to hear more activity details, and allowed him to provide timely advice. For example, he has stronger relationships with the officials in Ethiopia and a clearer sense of whom to go to for various requests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where being locally based enables strong relationship-building with local stakeholders. Such engagement facilitates timely feedback and problem solving, which can streamline operations and enhance cost effectiveness by reducing delays and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Examples of Dr. French's work to assist the Ethiopia program: 1. Initial program setup activities: creating processes and scheduling meetings to lay groundwork for future activities; developing and finalizing contracts between funders, Imperial Collage and implementers (the contracts are more complicated than normal because there are 2 funders and 2 implementing agencies).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates structured operational efforts to engage multiple stakeholders—from funders to local implementers—through planned processes and meetings. By securing alignment and clear communication among diverse groups, these actions help prevent missteps and cost overruns, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** There is a growing realization from all partners that a crucial step in the process of implementing control programs is the timely, efficient, and comprehensive reporting of results to funding bodies particularly, and the broader control community more generally. Having this step completely embedded in the process, and having the resources in country to achieve it, will help to strengthen the relationship between funders and implementers and facilitate future donations.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores the importance of embedding efficient reporting systems as a core operational process. Such systems, which rely on and reinforce local stakeholder engagement, build trust and ensure accountability. This strengthened relationship supports future funding and sustainable operations, thereby enhancing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2015-10-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For example, costs are lower in Sudan because the government provides matching funds for the program. This cost is lower than some previous estimates in part because SCI does not need to purchase praziquantel.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an example of how local stakeholder support (in this case, the government providing matching funds) reduces the intervention cost per treatment, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s operations.

- **Quote:** An official from the Nigerian Ministry of Health has proposed three states for SCI to work in, which have had no previous schistosomiasis treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that local stakeholder input (from the Nigerian Ministry of Health) is being integrated into strategic decision-making about intervention locations. Such operational engagement may help ensure that programs are better targeted, which can enhance cost effectiveness even if associated with initial start-up costs.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-14 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** During program planning, Ms. Nalule works directly with the national government to develop budgets and plans for the year (e.g. scheduling treatments, training, advocacy, etc.). The SCI budget is more or less set in advance, and with this information, local health ministers decide the best uses of funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that secures local stakeholder support by directly engaging national government officials in budgeting and planning. By incorporating local insight into resource allocation decisions, SCI can better align its interventions with on-the-ground needs, which is a key factor in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The funds are delivered straight to an account where Ugandan officials have access. There are two signatories, and the account requires both signatories to sign off on purchases. SCI's finance manager can monitor this account. A government accountant reports to SCI monthly and provides receipts and other spending details. This setup provides SCI with good visibility on spending.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational mechanism that integrates local stakeholder oversight into financial management. The dual-signatory requirement and regular reporting create a transparent framework that minimizes waste and mismanagement, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s interventions.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** We don't actually employ anybody in Africa because I believe strongly that the program should belong to the Africans. If you were to put an American expatriate in a country it would probably cost nearly $500,000 a year to sustain that person, they would end up running the program, and the local African people would not have ownership.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains an operational decision to avoid hiring expensive expatriates in favor of empowering local stakeholders. By relying on local ownership, SCI reduces personnel costs and enhances cost-effectiveness through lower overhead expenses.

- **Quote:** Governments generally provide in-kind support for the programs, not funding. They provide such things as staff salaries, office space and vehicles, while we provide fuel, maintenance, and staff per diems.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how SCI leverages local government contributions in the form of in-kind support. Such local stakeholder involvement decreases the financial burden on the charity, improving overall cost-effectiveness by offsetting key operational costs.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI had planned to use its normal methodology but agreed to use CNTD's protocol as it had stakeholder support and SCI was eager to proceed with the survey.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that an operational decision—in this case, switching to a protocol that was supported by local stakeholders—played a role in the intervention design. Although it does not explicitly link this decision to cost effectiveness, it implies that securing stakeholder support can influence methodological choices, potentially leading to more efficient or viable operational practices that may impact overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-04-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Cost per treatment tends to be lower in larger countries that are treating at national scale, countries that are at a later stage of the program, and countries where funding is available from other sources (which increases opportunities for collaboration and cost sharing). SCI believes that allocating unrestricted funds to countries with lower cost per treatment helps to demonstrate that its program is a highly cost effective intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the availability of additional funding sources – an indicator of successful stakeholder collaborations – to lower costs per treatment, thereby demonstrating how operational decisions rooted in stakeholder engagement can enhance the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** The government recently approached SCI about setting up a program.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows an operational process in which local stakeholders (in this case, the government) proactively engage with the charity. Such engagement not only secures local support but could also facilitate more cost‑efficient program designs and implementation.

- **Quote:** SCI's program manager for the country is currently in DRC having discussions with the government on establishing a national program.
- **Reasoning:** Here, active discussions with the government represent an operational process aimed at securing local stakeholder support. Establishing a national program can lead to economies of scale and cost sharing, which in turn contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI is working to transfer responsibility for cleaning and analyzing data to country programs. This process can delay SCI's access to the data (but is important for building capacity in countries).
- **Reasoning:** This operational process of shifting responsibilities to local programs builds local capacity and fosters ownership among stakeholders. Over time, such capacity building can reduce operational overheads and improve cost efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2015-09-08 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI develops a preventive chemotherapy plan with each country in order to create a projection of the number of treatments that each country might request. SCI then looks at these countries' actual treatment and budget requests to determine the total funding need for the year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where SCI collaborates with each country—effectively local stakeholders—to forecast treatment demand and budget needs. By engaging local actors in planning, SCI can align its resource allocation more closely with actual needs, a strategy that can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI is currently considering starting a program in Nigeria and is working to ensure that it uses funding effectively by partnering with existing organizations there and minimizing staffing costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links local partnerships with cost-effective funding use. By partnering with existing local organizations in Nigeria, SCI secures local stakeholder support, which helps minimize costs and enhances the overall cost effectiveness of its interventions.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Requests from countries partnering with organizations such as SCI are more likely to be approved. Those with inadequate financial backing might receive fewer than they request.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where local stakeholder partnerships (i.e., countries working with SCI) directly influence resource allocation. By securing solid local backing, the intervention is more likely to receive needed resources, which can contribute to improved cost effectiveness by ensuring funds are used efficiently.

- **Quote:** the Tanzanian government is responsible for program implementation. It has a very strong NTD team and a significant amount of political will.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the role of local stakeholder support, in this case, a government with strong institutional capacity and political will. Such support is an operational asset that can lead to more streamlined and effective interventions, potentially reducing costs and increasing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, it could commit multi-year funding to some countries (e.g. it could sign a contract with Madagascar for three years instead of one). It also would be able to meet country program needs without trimming budgets and help maintain positive relationships with program managers.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that stable, long-term funding arrangements and maintaining good relationships with local program managers (key stakeholders) are part of SCI's operational processes. These processes help avoid disruptive cost-cutting measures and promote efficient use of resources, indirectly contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Every August, African countries submit a request for the number of PZQ tablets they require for schistosomiasis treatment programs. Stakeholders meet in October or November to assess these requests and decide on allocations, taking into account PZQ availability.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of an operational process that actively involves local stakeholders in the planning and allocation of resources. Engaging stakeholders in this way helps align supply with actual local needs, which can reduce inefficiencies and thereby support cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** When considering a request to expand to a new country, SCI examines several factors, including need, capacity, and political will. Staffing is an important concern, as the SCI staff is currently working at full capacity. To start a new program, SCI would need to hire at least one program manager.
- **Reasoning:** This statement outlines how SCI’s decision-making process incorporates assessments of local conditions such as political will—a form of stakeholder support—before expanding operations. By ensuring that expansion only occurs where there is sufficient local capacity and support, SCI enhances the likelihood of efficient and cost-effective program implementation.

Such collaboration likely leverages local resources and contributions, which can reduce overall program costs and thereby enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI's role in mass drug administrations (MDAs) in general is to: Advocate for the benefits of mass drug distributions to government officials. Assist with planning and budgeting. Deliver funding and drugs to governments. Provide financial management and technical support. Develop procedures for monitoring and evaluation, analyze data, and write reports.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed list of activities shows the range of operational processes SCI conducts to secure local stakeholder (government) support. By engaging in these actions, SCI not only ensures smooth program implementation but also secures in-kind contributions and operational efficiencies that are crucial for lowering costs and improving overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** This figure relies on several difficult-to-estimate inputs including how to account for (a) donated drugs and (b) in-kind contributions from governments with which SCI works.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly ties the cost-effectiveness analysis to the benefits derived from local stakeholder support. The in-kind contributions from governments—secured through SCI’s operational processes—reduce the cost per treatment, thereby contributing to the overall cost-effectiveness of the charity.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Supplementary Information.md
- **Quote:** SCI's Program Manager for Cote d'Ivoire described her role (as of October 2014) as providing technical expertise, helping create budgets, monitoring training and MDAs, responding to problems (for example, surveying health workers to understand low coverage of non‑enrolled children, and advising on how to proceed with the program during a security threat), refining the protocol for the coverage survey, and coordinating with partners for integrated MDAs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details operational activities—such as budgeting, problem-solving, and especially coordinating with local partners—that are designed to secure local stakeholder support. While it doesn’t explicitly discuss cost effectiveness, these practices suggest a methodical approach to streamlining program implementation, which can contribute to cost-effective outcomes.

- **Quote:** SCI's Program Manager for Ethiopia described his role (as of October 2014) as assisting with initial program set up and funder agreements, drafting detailed plans for the next 12 months and general plans for the next 5 years, and providing technical assistance for mapping and some guidance on MDA implementation. At the time, he lived in the country and worked closely with the government NTD team.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the operational process of embedding staff locally and collaborating closely with government teams. Such an approach secures local stakeholder buy‑in, which may lower implementation costs and improve efficiency—a potential contributor to overall cost effectiveness even though the link is implicit.

- **Quote:** SCI told us that, due to strong in-country capacity, SCI provides only limited technical assistance for MDA. Instead, SCI's technical assistance in the country is focused on operational research on how best to move toward elimination of schistosomiasis.
- **Reasoning:** By emphasizing the reliance on strong in-country capacity, this quote indicates that local stakeholders are effectively handling much of the operational work. This shift reduces the need for extensive external support, suggesting that leveraging local capacity can help lower operational costs and, indirectly, enhance the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** We (Natalie and Holden) attended a meeting in Lilongwe for stakeholders in Malawi's schistosomiasis control program funded by DFID, UK through their project named "ICOSA". The meeting included representatives from Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI, represented by Alan Fenwick and Charlotte Gower), the Center for Neglected Tropical Diseases (CNTD) at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (conducting the evaluation for the program, and represented by Maria Rebollo), DFID (financial support for ICOSA), World Vision (supplying 4 million tablets per year of praziquantel for the program), the Malawi Ministries of Health and Education, and district health offices.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes an operational process that secures local stakeholder support by bringing together key local entities alongside international partners. Involving these local stakeholders can foster contextually informed decision-making and resource sharing, which may reduce inefficiencies and contribute indirectly to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity intervention.

- **Quote:** Prof. Fenwick said this issue was likely due to lack of eating before taking PZQ; he noted that those carrying out mass drug administration should coordinate with school feeding programs when possible, and when this wasn't possible, should provide some food or at least use social mobilization to make sure kids know to eat first. He stated, "An upset stomach is a good sign, it means the PZQ is working, but vomiting is not, it means the PZQ is wasted."
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational recommendation to coordinate with school feeding programs—a local stakeholder—in order to ensure that children have eaten prior to taking praziquantel. This coordination is presented as a means to prevent drug wastage (i.e., avoid vomiting that wastes PZQ), thereby linking local stakeholder engagement with improved resource utilization and overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

## Code: Training local workforce: Improving the skills of the workforce employed by the charity’s local partners.
### Doc Name: 2014-05-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For the non-sentinel schools, the National Schistosomiasis and STH Control Program were responsible for coordinating the mass treatment for all schools in each district. Cascade training was carried out where teachers were trained at the district level on how to administer the deworming drugs. The teachers in turn were responsible for treating the children with supervision from district level health staff. The district level health staff were in turn trained and supervised by the central level Ministry of Health.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides concrete evidence of a training initiative — cascade training — where local teachers and district health staff are trained to administer deworming treatment. It illustrates an operational process in which the skills of locally embedded personnel are enhanced, a process that can contribute to cost-effective practices in charitable programs by utilizing existing local workforces.

### Doc Name: 2014-11-04 Interview Notes.md

Although it does not elaborate on the specifics of how training develops local workforce skills, it shows that training is integrated into the overall planning and execution, implying a structured approach that could underpin cost-effective practices.

- **Quote:** Activity reviews after each activity (MDA, M&E) are more informative. For example, she learned that coverage surveys required more preparation than previously expected and that some surveyors did not appreciate the rationale for selecting villages. The latter led to improving the explanation during training, so that surveyors appreciated the importance of random selection, for example.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an iterative training initiative aimed at improving local surveyors’ understanding of operational protocols. By enhancing training based on feedback, the organization improves the effectiveness of its data collection process, which is a key operational improvement that may lead to more efficient (and thus more cost-effective) practices.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** We don't actually employ anybody in Africa because I believe strongly that the program should belong to the Africans. If you were to put an American expatriate in a country it would probably cost nearly $500,000 a year to sustain that person, they would end up running the program, and the local African people would not have ownership.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a deliberate operational choice to avoid hiring expensive expatriate staff by relying on, and implicitly training, local personnel. The emphasis on local ownership reflects a cost-effective practice in organizational operations, aligning with the research question on how such training initiatives contribute to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A team of government staff goes out to each village, trains the teachers, counts out the number of drugs that are needed in each village, and gives the drugs to the teachers. Then they come back 3 months later and evaluate the program and make sure the schoolchildren have received the drugs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly describes a training initiative within the operational process, where government staff train local teachers to participate in drug distribution. It illustrates how building capacity among local workforces is an integral part of a cost-effective delivery model in charity operations.

- **Reasoning:** This quote hints at an element of capacity building—which can be seen as a training initiative aimed at improving workforce skills—that is part of SCI’s operational approach. However, the text does not elaborate on specific training initiatives for local workforces or explicitly link these capacity‐building efforts to the charity’s cost‐effective practices, providing only minimal and indirect evidence related to the research question.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** The Disease Control Priorities Report states that schools provide a strong infrastructure and that teachers can be trained to deliver drugs safely.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of training initiatives—specifically training teachers, a component of the local workforce—to safely administer deworming treatments. It suggests that by leveraging existing local infrastructure and enhancing local skills, intervention delivery can be managed in a cost-effective manner. However, the document offers limited discussion on such training initiatives, providing only this brief mention in the context of deworming programs.

### Doc Name: 2011-10-18 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Per-diem costs (i.e., rewards to those who deliver the drugs) can be a significant part of the delivery costs: An example could be $10-20 for a one- or two-day training for teachers or health surveillance assistants. We estimated (informally) that these could be up to half of delivery costs and Prof. Fenwick said that sounded about right.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly mentions a training initiative aimed at local workforce (teachers and health surveillance assistants) and quantifies its cost as part of the operational expenses. It provides concrete detail on how training is factored into the delivery process, thereby contributing to the cost-effective practices in charity-led health programs, which is directly relevant to the research question.

## Code: Intra-intervention monitoring: Monitoring the charity’s intervention during its implementation.
### Doc Name: 2021 Charity Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Coverage evaluation surveys are household surveys that measure what proportion of a target population received treatment at the last MDA in a selection of areas. These allow us to assess the quality of the implementation process in terms of achieving targets, and give an indication of the quality of a country's reporting process.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a monitoring tool used during the intervention to evaluate the operational implementation process. By assessing whether targets are met and quality standards are maintained, such monitoring can inform adjustments that may enhance cost effectiveness, even though the quote does not explicitly mention cost savings.

- **Quote:** At baseline (in 2004), each of the sentinel schools were sampled by a team from the research lab who arrived in the morning to take samples from 150 students selected at random, which were then taken back to the lab for analysis. In the afternoon, one or two lab staff remained at the school to supervise the deworming drug administration and to ensure that all students in the school were treated.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a monitoring activity carried out during the intervention. The dual-phase process (morning sampling and afternoon supervision) ensures that treatment is properly administered, thereby reducing errors and potential wastage, which can indirectly improve cost effectiveness in resource allocation.

- **Quote:** The sentinel sites were treated two weeks prior to the national MDA to ensure that the schools were not treated twice. SCI were able to then monitor registers from the national campaign showing which schools had received treatment in the MDA to ensure that the sentinel schools were not twice treated.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process where monitoring registers prevents redundant treatment. By ensuring that sentinel schools do not receive double treatment, the intervention avoids unnecessary expenditure, an approach that supports cost-effective use of resources.

- **Quote:** Each year prior to treatment 250 people are sampled (100 l({}^{*}
 year students; 100 9-12 year olds; and 50 adults) with the aim of monitoring the impact of drug intensity on infection patterns.
- **Reasoning:** This excerpt from the SCORE study outlines an ongoing monitoring process during implementation to evaluate different treatment intensities. Such systematic data collection can inform decisions on which operational strategies yield the best outcomes relative to their costs, contributing to enhanced cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-08-01 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI sends supervisors into the field with survey teams to ensure that the teams are adhering to protocol; these supervisors monitor each team for a few days before moving on to the next. In data quality checks, 10% of diagnostic slides are re-read by another technician to double check that the surveyors accurately measured egg counts. An example of a problem that this process was able to detect and correct: supervisors discovered that some teams were throwing out urine samples if a child provided less than 10 mL of urine, rather than reading the sample and recording the volume, as the protocol called for.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a key monitoring process implemented during the intervention that identifies and corrects deviations from protocol in real time. Such active oversight reduces errors and unnecessary rework, thereby contributing to improved operational processes that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Data were collected through phone by SurveyCTO, an app which is designed to minimize errors and which uploads data daily. Since data are uploaded so frequently, the SCI team can look through them regularly to check for problems.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the use of technology for real-time data collection and continuous monitoring during implementation. Frequent data uploads allow the team to promptly detect and address issues, which supports efficient operations and, in turn, promotes cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-11-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI's model of funding the government, providing technical assistance, and closely monitoring expenses works well and is not overly bureaucratic.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly highlights that the charity (SCI) actively monitors expenses during its intervention, implying that such monitoring helps streamline financial operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness through better operational processes.

- **Quote:** The monitoring and evaluation data that SCI requires is based on a global standard. It is generally not used to adjust the program at the national level because any problems it identifies are dealt with at a local level.
- **Reasoning:** This passage shows that while SCI gathers standardized monitoring data during implementation, the identified issues are resolved locally. This suggests an operational mechanism where localized adjustments are made based on continuous monitoring, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness by ensuring problems are addressed efficiently.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** For the MDA, she arrived in the country about one week before training to make sure that materials were prepared and funds were available and distributed according to the agreed budget lines. She spent five days in the field observing training and supervising treatments alongside the Ministry of Health team.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates active on-site monitoring during the intervention. Dr. Nogaro’s early arrival to confirm budget alignment and subsequent in-field supervision ensures that resources are correctly deployed and issues are promptly addressed. Such oversight contributes to operational efficiency and cost effectiveness by preventing budget overruns and ensuring the intervention runs smoothly.

- **Quote:** During this time, SCI took a second reading of 10% of the slides to determine whether the surveyors were accurately measuring egg counts. After the training, the supervisors of each field team continued to take a second reading of 10% of the slides and record the results. If a big disparity were found, then the supervisor would do additional training. Additional training was not needed in Cote d'Ivoire.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates a quality control monitoring process integrated into the intervention. By double-checking measurements and providing additional training only when discrepancies were observed, SCI minimized errors and avoided unnecessary costs. This approach improves operational processes by ensuring precision and reducing the potential need for costly remedial actions.

- **Quote:** Every month the country will send back the monthly cash book with all the receipts to SCI. All expenses need to be accounted for. Every cash book and receipt is checked by SCI Finance Manager, as well as by the SCI program Manager.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the financial monitoring component during implementation. Regular reconciliation of expenses and strict adherence to budgetary controls ensure that funds are used as intended. Such financial oversight contributes to cost effectiveness by promoting accountability and preventing resource misallocation within the operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** This does not include administrative or monitoring and evaluation (M&E) costs. Including these costs yields a rough estimate of 50p per treatment.
- **Reasoning:** This quote acknowledges that monitoring and evaluation are built into the operational costs during implementation. Although it focuses on costs, it suggests that monitoring is an integral part of the intervention process that could influence cost effectiveness by ensuring that the full scope of expenditures is considered.

- **Quote:** Treatments are carried out, but SCI also finds M&E to be a challenge there, as the collected coverage data for SCI's statisticians to evaluate has not yet been analyzed.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a specific instance during implementation—data is collected for monitoring purposes, yet it remains unanalyzed. This emphasizes that effective monitoring (and timely analysis) could inform operational adjustments that enhance cost effectiveness, even though the current process is facing challenges.

- **Quote:** Ms. Labry established a more robust budgeting system for each country in SCI's portfolio, and all program managers have been trained on the new systems. Ms. Labry also created a cash book system to track funding sent to each country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote, while focusing on financial monitoring, illustrates how internal monitoring systems during implementation help improve operational processes. Improved tracking and accountability of funds can contribute to more cost‑effective management of resources, indirectly supporting the overall effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2015-12-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Grant monitoring and reporting was generally done by program officers, and there is no regular electronic reporting process. Program officers have varying approaches and abilities in this area. Some, such as Dr. Peter Jourdan and Dr. Sarah Nogaro, are comfortable working with financial information and are consistently in control of their program's finances. They also frequently work in-country, and have the confidence to question government partners when necessary.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the active role of program officers in monitoring the intervention during its implementation. Their in-country presence and capacity to question government partners ensures that financial management is closely observed, which contributes to more effective operational processes and potentially enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In some countries, such as Madagascar and Niger, rather than transfer funds directly to the MoH, they are sent through in-country non-governmental organization (NGO) partners who verify program activity logs before releasing the funds. (This process was also being set up in Tanzania when Ms. Labry was leaving SCI.) NGOs tend to have better accounting systems in place, as well as staff trained in grant monitoring.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a monitoring mechanism where NGO partners verify program activity logs before initiating fund transfers. This practice adds an extra layer of accountability during the intervention, which can help optimize operational processes and enhance cost effectiveness by reducing risks such as fraud.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For example, in a previous treatment round, the CNTD program manager reported to SCI that there would be 10 million SCH treatments. Later, SCI learned that there were only 6 million SCH treatments. This was the correct number of treatments to give based on the prevalence data found during mapping, but the praziquantel (PZQ) supplied was much greater than what was actually needed and this caused issues with SCI's reporting to DFID. The excess PZQ will be used next year. CNTD has recently restructured internally and this has led to an improved working relationship with SCI. CNTD will continue to run the mass drug administration (MDA), but SCI has become more directly involved with the M&E as it has the SCH technical expertise to manage these activities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how monitoring and evaluation processes during implementation allow SCI to detect discrepancies in reported treatment numbers. By identifying the mismatch between planned and actual treatments, SCI can adjust resource allocation (as shown by the handling of excess PZQ), thereby enhancing operational processes that ultimately contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Program managers can learn about issues by looking at treatment reports, e.g. how many reports come back and how quickly. Low reported coverage is a trigger to investigate. SCI program managers normally have a good relationship with country program managers and can discuss possible issues with them.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that continuous monitoring of treatment reports serves as an operational check. The timely detection of low reported coverage triggers investigations and corrective actions, ensuring that operational inefficiencies are addressed promptly, which contributes to a more cost effective intervention.

- **Quote:** Going forward, SCI is adopting a financial risk matrix. This will assign each country a risk score and help SCI monitor high risk countries closely, while spending less time checking receipts for low risk countries. Risk factors might include whether there are financial staff in-country, if DFID had special restrictions in place, or if there are more intermediaries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how implementing tailored financial monitoring tools, such as a risk matrix, can optimize the allocation of oversight resources. By focusing more attention on high-risk areas and reducing effort in low-risk scenarios, SCI enhances its operational processes and ensures that funds are used more efficiently, thereby boosting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-04-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Figures and treatment numbers in the initial versions of SCI's annual budgets are based on an optimal situation. They are refined as new information becomes available regarding:
* Drug availability in country and in the market; for example, there can be frequent shortages of praziquantel.
* Epidemiological mapping results.
* Opportunities for cost-sharing with other funders.
* The program delivery capacity of the country's Ministry of Health (MoH).
* The success of SCI's fundraising efforts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI updates its budgets during implementation as monitored information becomes available. By refining figures based on real-time data such as drug availability and program capacity, SCI is able to adjust operational processes to help ensure that resources are used cost‑effectively.

- **Quote:** SCI has always signed formal contracts with countries, but many were first signed five or six years ago and amended annually to ensure that they accurately reflect the current budget and plans. Other reasons for amendments include deadline extensions or additional donor requirements.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that SCI regularly revisits and updates its contractual agreements to align with current budgets and operational realities. This ongoing adjustment, likely informed by monitoring the intervention's progress, contributes to maintaining a cost-effective operational framework.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-15 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Dr. French has been living in Ethiopia, which has helped him build relationships, enabled him to hear more activity details, and allowed him to provide timely advice. For example, he has stronger relationships with the officials in Ethiopia and a clearer sense of whom to go to for various requests. Also, by being close to the activities, some problems with data flowing back to central level have been clearer, which makes it easier for him to help develop solutions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how on‑the‑ground monitoring during implementation enables the identification of operational challenges (such as issues with data flow) and facilitates timely problem-solving. Such responsiveness in the operational process can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing delays and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Reporting. There is a growing realization from all partners that a crucial step in the process of implementing control programs is the timely, efficient, and comprehensive reporting of results to funding bodies particularly, and the broader control community more generally. Having this step completely embedded in the process, and having the resources in country to achieve it, will help to strengthen the relationship between funders and implementers and facilitate future donations.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that robust monitoring—in this case through structured reporting—is viewed as an integral operational process. By ensuring that results are shared efficiently and transparently, the program can adapt and secure funding, ultimately enhancing the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-14 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** She can mostly follow along via emails, though it is usually necessary to visit the country just prior to the MDA to ensure monitoring data is collected correctly.
- **Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes the need for in-person monitoring during the intervention (MDA) to verify that data collection is accurate. By ensuring the quality of monitoring data, the charity can make informed operational decisions and adjust processes, which is a key component in enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Activity reviews after each activity (MDA, M&E) are more informative. For example, she learned that coverage surveys required more preparation than previously expected and that some surveyors did not appreciate the rationale for selecting villages. The latter led to improving the explanation during training, so that surveyors appreciated the importance of random selection, for example.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how systematic reviews (a form of monitoring) following each phase of the intervention uncover operational shortcomings. The insights gained lead to adjustments in future training and processes, thereby streamlining the intervention and potentially enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** The funds are delivered straight to an account where Ugandan officials have access. There are two signatories, and the account requires both signatories to sign off on purchases. SCI's finance manager can monitor this account. A government accountant reports to SCI monthly and provides receipts and other spending details. This setup provides SCI with good visibility on spending.
- **Reasoning:** Although this excerpt focuses on financial oversight, it demonstrates a parallel monitoring system that provides real-time insights into spending. This financial monitoring helps ensure that expenditures align with budget expectations, an operational control that is essential for maintaining cost effectiveness during implementation.

### Doc Name: 2010-06-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** We also provide monitoring and evaluation to make sure that the drugs that are donated and the money which is donated is used as intended, as well as assistance with the planning and budgeting. Our monitoring and evaluation activities include checking that drugs have been delivered by going into schools and asking the children whether they've been treated, and asking the teachers whether they've been well trained. We also test the efficacy of the drug by doing stool and urine tests.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that during implementation, SCI uses monitoring and evaluation processes not only to verify that the intervention (drug distribution) is carried out as planned, but also to support planning and budgeting. This operational oversight helps ensure that resources are used as intended, thereby contributing to the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** SCI staff don't only conduct monitoring and evaluation. They also act as a catalyst, and provide assistance whenever a government requests it. Assistance can include technical help, managerial help, or auditing help.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI integrates its monitoring efforts with broader operational support functions, offering technical, managerial, and auditing assistance. Such proactive engagement during implementation can enhance operational processes and ensure that interventions are managed cost-effectively.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-02 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** While Mr. Gastfriend is open to the idea of IDinsight providing monitoring services for both MDAs, he would prefer that IDinsight's first monitoring activity focused on one project. This would allow IDinsight to use the results to design future monitoring activities in other locations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that monitoring during the intervention is being used to gather insights that will inform the design of future monitoring activities. By starting with a focused project, the charity can refine its operational processes, potentially leading to more cost-effective interventions as lessons are learned and applied.

- **Quote:** Obtaining the required amount of detail using this method at a district level would not be cost effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly ties the design of the monitoring process to cost effectiveness, indicating that the charity considers the balance between detailed data collection and cost. It supports the idea that monitoring methods are chosen and adapted to enhance operational processes by avoiding unnecessarily expensive strategies.

- **Quote:** SCI is interested in the possibility of monitoring its MDA process through spot checks, a technique that has been used by the Deworm the World Initiative.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity is exploring alternative, more resource-efficient monitoring methods (spot checks) during the implementation of the intervention. Such methods can provide real-time data with lower costs, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-04-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI has given DFID a plan for how it expects to allocate funds by country, but will have discretion to alter these allocations in response new data and to the evolving situation in each country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that SCI uses ongoing monitoring during implementation to adjust its funding allocations based on new data and situational changes. Such flexibility in operational decision‑making helps ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Under the DFID grant, sentinel sites are placed only in areas with prevalence over 10%. This is for two reasons, (i) inclusion of areas with a lower starting level of infection would necessitate prohibitively large sample sizes to get sufficient power to detect target reductions in prevalence and intensity and (ii) it is in the areas where disease is most prevalent that demonstrating impact is most important for the disease control phase of a program.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how monitoring informs operational processes by using data (high prevalence areas) to target intervention assessments. By focusing monitoring efforts where impact is most likely to be demonstrated, SCI reduces unnecessary data collection costs, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Data collection has increased under the DFID grant. For example, SCI is now conducting coverage validation surveys in most DFID-funded countries. It did not collect this information previously, so earlier data does not exist.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI has intensified its monitoring during implementation by initiating new data collection approaches. Such enhanced monitoring provides the operational data needed to evaluate and adjust interventions, which can eventually lead to more cost‑effective practices.

### Doc Name: 2015-09-08 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI currently analyzes field data using Excel spreadsheets, which is inefficient. It plans to begin using new software to improve its analysis.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that SCI is actively monitoring field data during its intervention. The planned upgrade to new software suggests an effort to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of this monitoring process, which can lead to better‑informed operational decisions and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI develops a preventive chemotherapy plan with each country in order to create a projection of the number of treatments that each country might request. SCI then looks at these countries' actual treatment and budget requests to determine the total funding need for the year.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates a feedback mechanism where planned projections are compared with actual treatment and budget requests. Such monitoring during implementation helps adjust resource allocation in real time, contributing to more efficient operational processes and potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI worked with Accenture Development Partnerships to conduct a systems review of its financial and project management processes at the end of 2014. As a result of this review, SCI now has additional tools for tracking revenue and spending, which are currently being rolled out at SCI and its partner organizations.
- **Reasoning:** Although this quote focuses primarily on financial and project management monitoring, it demonstrates how systematic tracking tools are implemented to oversee operational processes. By improving the tracking of revenue and spending, the organization is positioned to better manage resources, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Summary.md
- **Quote:** SCI has conducted studies to monitor (a non-representative sample of) about 60% of the treatments it has funded since 2014 (70% in the most recently completed cycle) to determine whether its programs have reached a large proportion of children targeted.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI systematically monitors a significant portion of its treatments during implementation, providing critical data on program reach. This monitoring informs operational adjustments and supports evaluations of cost-effectiveness by ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated based on actual performance.

- **Quote:** Develop procedures for monitoring and evaluation, analyze data, and write reports.
- **Reasoning:** This bullet point from SCI's role in mass drug administration programs illustrates that monitoring and evaluation are integral operational processes. By routinely analyzing data and reporting on outcomes, SCI is able to make informed decisions that improve operational efficiency and enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI told us that its U.K.-based staff review data daily as it is entered, looking for missing or concerning data and correcting errors.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights real‑time monitoring and quality control measures. Daily reviews and prompt error corrections ensure accurate data collection, which is essential for evaluating program performance and making operational adjustments that contribute to cost‑effective interventions.

### Doc Name: 2021 GiveWell Supplementary Information.md
- **Quote:** SCI's Program Manager for Cote d'Ivoire described her role (as of October 2014) as providing technical expertise, helping create budgets, monitoring training and MDAs, responding to problems (for example, surveying health workers to understand low coverage of non-enrolled children, and advising on how to proceed with the program during a security threat), refining the protocol for the coverage survey, and coordinating with partners for integrated MDAs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that monitoring is an integral operational process during implementation. It shows how active monitoring (e.g., tracking training and MDAs) enables the charity to respond to issues (like low coverage) and adjust operational protocols, thereby potentially enhancing cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are used efficiently.

- **Quote:** SCI's program manager for Uganda describes her role as (as of October 2014) assisting with budgets and plans, talking to the government regularly (largely through email) leading up to an MDA to make sure all the components are prepared, traveling to the country to oversee collection of prevalence and intensity data prior to an MDA, following up with the government after an MDA to get the data needed for reporting to DFID, and participating in activity reviews after each stage of the program (for example, after an MDA and after monitoring and evaluation activities).
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity incorporates monitoring and evaluation into its day-to-day operations. By collecting data before and after interventions and participating in activity reviews, the organization is able to adjust its operational processes, which contributes to ensuring that the intervention is cost‑effective.

### Doc Name: 2011-10-18 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Prof. Fenwick said this issue was likely due to lack of eating before taking PZQ; he noted that those carrying out mass drug administration should coordinate with school feeding programs when possible, and when this wasn't possible, should provide some food or at least use social mobilization to make sure kids know to eat first. He stated, "An upset stomach is a good sign, it means the PZQ is working, but vomiting is not, it means the PZQ is wasted."
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how monitoring during the intervention identifies operational issues (children taking the drug on an empty stomach) and informs adjustments (coordinating with school feeding programs) that prevent wastage of medication, directly linking intervention monitoring to processes that enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The goal of mapping is to provide a cost-effective way to determine how much treatment is needed and the frequency of treatment required.
- **Reasoning:** This statement shows that using monitoring activities like mapping helps to precisely assess treatment needs, enabling resource allocation based on robust data. This directly contributes to operational decisions that improve cost efficiency by avoiding over- or under-treatment.

- **Quote:** He noted that they hadn't had enough stationery to do data collection, so they didn't have the hoped-for data.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a shortfall in the monitoring process due to inadequate resources for data collection. It underscores the importance of proper monitoring in gathering the necessary information for making informed operational adjustments that underpin cost‑effective interventions.

## Code: Imposing standards on local stakeholders: Imposing requirements on the stakeholders involved in the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2015-09-14 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** When SCI transfers funds to a country program, it sometimes takes several months to get documentation that the funding was received.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI imposes a requirement on local country programs to provide documentation confirming funds receipt. Although delays occur due to remote communication challenges, the process of requiring documentation is an operational control that can enhance accountability and proper fund management, indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI is working on improving its contract planning, because drafting contracts, coming to an agreement with all parties, and getting the contracts signed can be a long process - and a bottleneck to SCI operations.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights efforts to streamline contract processes which involve multiple local stakeholders. By addressing bottlenecks in contractual agreements, SCI aims to reduce delays and inefficiencies, an improvement that can contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of its interventions.

- **Quote:** Ms. Al Abdallah plans to implement a system for financial information to be updated regularly so that up-to-date information is available for the current year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates an operational process that will require regular updates from local teams or financial controllers. Ensuring timely and accurate financial reporting enhances decision-making and resource allocation, indirectly contributing to achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-05-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** For the non-sentinel schools, the National Schistosomiasis and STH Control Program were responsible for coordinating the mass treatment for all schools in each district. Cascade training was carried out where teachers were trained at the district level on how to administer the deworming drugs. The teachers in turn were responsible for treating the children with supervision from district level health staff. The district level health staff were in turn trained and supervised by the central level Ministry of Health.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that imposes structured requirements on local stakeholders (teachers, district health staff, and ministry officials) through cascade training and supervision. By ensuring that all tiers of local implementers follow standardized procedures, the process helps to optimize intervention delivery and resource use, which can contribute to achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The sentinel sites were treated two weeks prior to the national MDA to ensure that the schools were not treated twice. SCI were able to then monitor registers from the national campaign showing which schools had received treatment in the MDA to ensure that the sentinel schools were not twice treated.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational requirement imposed on local stakeholders to adhere to a strict treatment schedule and monitoring protocol. Preventing duplicate treatment reduces unnecessary expenditure and resource wastage, thereby indirectly supporting cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-08-01 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** SCI sends supervisors into the field with survey teams to ensure that the teams are adhering to protocol; these supervisors monitor each team for a few days before moving on to the next.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where SCI imposes requirements on local survey teams (local stakeholders) by closely monitoring adherence to protocols. Although the text does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, such stringent oversight helps maintain data quality and resource efficiency, which are critical to achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** An SCI supervisor found that a team responsible for five of the districts was not adhering to protocol. The team was replaced, the managers for three of the districts were replaced, the results from before the replacement were thrown out of the data analysis, and those five districts were remapped in 2016.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a corrective operational process that imposes strict requirements on local stakeholders by enforcing adherence to protocols, including replacing non-compliant teams and redoing parts of the intervention. Such measures ensure reliable outcomes and avoid wasted resources, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-11-04 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Mr. Shafi gets reports of coverage levels and reports from supervision teams that visit communities after MDAs to check the accuracy of coverage reports.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where local stakeholders (community-based supervision teams) are required to report and verify coverage data post-intervention. Such reporting can contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring the accuracy of implementation data and enabling timely corrections at the local level.

- **Quote:** The biggest costs of the schistosomiasis program are transport and per diems for district-level training meetings prior to an MDA and review meetings held after MDAs for teachers and health workers to report coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates that the program imposes specific operational requirements on local stakeholders—namely, participating in pre-intervention training meetings and post-intervention review meetings. These processes, while incurring costs, are designed to ensure effective communication and accountability, which are potential contributors to achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-10-16 Interview Notes 2.md
- **Quote:** Money is only released against a defined activity that was written in the annual country work plan. Every month the country will send back the monthly cash book with all the receipts to SCI. All expenses need to be accounted for. Every cash book and receipt is checked by SCI Finance Manager, as well as by the SCI program Manager.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a rigorous financial control process imposed on local stakeholders, requiring detailed financial documentation and accountability before funds are released. Such operational requirements help ensure that expenditures are aligned with planned activities, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Treatment in schools is quite straightforward:
1. The children are gathered and the headmaster explains the treatment. The children can ask questions. Teachers can answer most questions and call a nurse or program staff for guidance when they cannot.
2. Teachers ask all children individually, prior to distributing the medication, if they are feeling well and if they have eaten.
3. For children who answer yes to both questions, teachers measure them with the dose pole.
4. Children are given the appropriate number of pills and clean water to help swallow the pills.
5. The teachers record the number of pills each child has taken.
6. Teachers record any secondary effects on specific forms and submit them with the treatment registers at the end of the activity.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed protocol imposes clear operational requirements on teachers (local stakeholders) during the mass drug administration. By standardizing procedures—from pre-treatment checks to record-keeping—the process minimizes administration errors and ensures efficient delivery of treatment, which can indirectly reduce costs and support cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI plays an advisory role to the government and encourages them to have overall ownership of the program. The country decides the treatment plans, and SCI's program mangers provide technical expertise and help create budget requests alongside the Ministry of Health team. This budget is submitted to SCI senior management who make allocation decisions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a collaborative budgeting and planning process that requires local stakeholders to actively contribute to budget formulation and treatment planning. By imposing such structured requirements, the process ensures that resource allocation is carefully controlled and monitored, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2016-02-17 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In 2015, SCI implemented the use of cashbooks by its country programs to report monthly spending. Countries where SCI receives funding from the Department for International Development (DFID) implemented this system first, and it has now been rolled out to all of SCI's country programs. A few countries are currently delayed in submitting cashbooks to SCI because of limited capacity. These cashbooks are currently used by Imperial College in its 'Value for Money' analysis of SCI. In the future, SCI plans to input data from the cashbooks into its own accounting software.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that SCI requires its local country programs (local stakeholders) to maintain cashbooks as a systematic operational process. This reporting is used in a 'Value for Money' analysis, linking the imposed requirement on local stakeholders directly to mechanisms that assess and help maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Each of SCI's country programs produces a plan predicting its treatment numbers for the next three years. (These projections are later refined annually based on more up-to-date epidemiological data.) Each program submits a detailed work plan and budget request based on these projections. SCI holds a series of allocation meetings to match programs' funding requests with its available funds from different sources, including both unrestricted and restricted funds (e.g. from DFID and the END Fund). SCI has also performed an internal process review and has produced a detailed Gantt chart outlining timelines for its programs (e.g., Preventive Chemotherapy Treatment plans), deadlines for budget and work plan submissions, and timelines for funding allocation. SCI has also finalized its reserves policy.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates the operational processes imposed on local stakeholders by requiring country programs to forecast treatment numbers, submit detailed work plans, and budget requests. The systematic nature of these requirements facilitates efficient resource allocation and planning, which are critical components in achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-07-31 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** In certain countries where the national ministries of health lack sufficient capacity, Ms. Labry has identified reliable local NGOs that will accept and distribute SCI's funds into their bank accounts. SCI will pay for a local accountant or account assistant who will work in the NGO's office, collecting and distributing SCI's funds. SCI will also pay 5-6% of the NGO's local office overhead. This is a more cost-effective solution than establishing offices in all of SCI's countries. So far, SCI has implemented this system in DRC, Cote d'Ivoire, and Tanzania, and it hopes to gradually begin implementing it in other countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly illustrates an operational process in which SCI imposes requirements on local stakeholders (i.e., local NGOs) by mandating that they manage and distribute funds with specific cost-related measures such as overhead contributions and local accounting support. It directly ties this requirement to achieving cost effectiveness by noting that this approach is more cost-effective than establishing full-scale offices, thereby addressing how such processes contribute to both achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In some countries, such as Madagascar and Niger, rather than transfer funds directly to the MoH, they are sent through in-country non-governmental organization (NGO) partners who verify program activity logs before releasing the funds. (This process was also being set up in Tanzania when Ms. Labry was leaving SCI.) NGOs tend to have better accounting systems in place, as well as staff trained in grant monitoring.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes an operational process that imposes a requirement on local NGO partners—verifying program activity logs before funds are released. By channeling funds through partners with robust accounting and monitoring capabilities, SCI mitigates fraud risks and enhances accountability, thereby contributing to maintaining cost effectiveness of the charity’s intervention.

- **Quote:** CNTD's program manager for Mozambique submits timesheets to SCI on what s/he has been working on.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process imposed on a local stakeholder (the CNTD program manager) by requiring regular reporting of work activities. Such a requirement supports oversight and accountability, which can indirectly contribute to maintaining cost effectiveness through better resource allocation and monitoring.

- **Quote:** CNTD provides SCI with a summary report of costs that includes some breakdowns by activity (e.g. MDA supervision, transportation, training, per diems). There haven't been surprises in looking at these reports.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process mandates detailed financial reporting from the local stakeholder, which allows for close monitoring of expenditures. By breaking down costs by activity, SCI can ensure that spending is aligned with planned budgets, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The standard in SCI (though not CNTD) is to have receipts scanned and coded in the country and then sent back to SCI. Historically, SCI's finance manager has checked all of those receipts. Occasionally, some receipts are missing. This gets caught and the program manager investigates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a financial control process that requires local stakeholders to properly document spending through receipt scanning and coding. Such a process helps in identifying discrepancies early and ensures accountability, which is key in achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Initial program setup activities: creating processes and scheduling meetings to lay groundwork for future activities; developing and finalizing contracts between funders, Imperial Collage and implementers (the contracts are more complicated than normal because there are 2 funders and 2 implementing agencies).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that SCI uses structured operational processes—such as developing contracts and scheduling meetings—to impose formal requirements on its local partners and implementers. By clearly delineating roles and responsibilities through these procedures, the intervention is designed to ensure coordinated action, which can contribute to efficient use of resources and thereby maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Reporting. There is a growing realization from all partners that a crucial step in the process of implementing control programs is the timely, efficient, and comprehensive reporting of results to funding bodies particularly, and the broader control community more generally. Having this step completely embedded in the process, and having the resources in country to achieve it, will help to strengthen the relationship between funders and implementers and facilitate future donations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the operational process of embedding strict reporting requirements among local stakeholders. Such reporting ensures accountability and transparency, which bolster relationships with funders and support sustained, efficient resource allocation, indirectly promoting cost effective intervention management.

- **Quote:** During program planning, Ms. Nalule works directly with the national government to develop budgets and plans for the year (e.g. scheduling treatments, training, advocacy, etc.). The SCI budget is more or less set in advance, and with this information, local health ministers decide the best uses of funds.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that involves local stakeholders (the national government and health ministers) in setting and managing budgets. By establishing a structured planning process, the intervention can allocate resources efficiently, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The funds are delivered straight to an account where Ugandan officials have access. There are two signatories, and the account requires both signatories to sign off on purchases. SCI's finance manager can monitor this account. A government accountant reports to SCI monthly and provides receipts and other spending details. This setup provides SCI with good visibility on spending.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a financial oversight process imposed on local stakeholders, requiring dual sign-off on purchases and monthly financial reporting. Such rigorous controls ensure transparency and accountability, which are critical components in achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We take the money and hold it for specific activities, release it to governments on an as-needed basis, and collect receipts from governments to provide to the donor. This minimizes the risk of funding being diverted for other purposes. We also provide monitoring and evaluation to make sure that the drugs that are donated and the money which is donated is used as intended, as well as assistance with the planning and budgeting.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates SCI's operational process of controlling fund disbursement by imposing requirements on local government stakeholders. By only releasing funds based on verified receipts and conducting thorough monitoring and evaluation, SCI minimizes resource misallocation, which indirectly helps achieve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** A team of government staff goes out to each village, trains the teachers, counts out the number of drugs that are needed in each village, and gives the drugs to the teachers. Then they come back 3 months later and evaluate the program and make sure the schoolchildren have received the drugs. They test the children's hemoglobin and parasite loads to make sure the drugs are being given and have been effective.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a structured, step-by-step process imposed on local stakeholders. By requiring government staff to carry out specific tasks—distribution, training, and post-distribution evaluation—SCI ensures accountability and efficient use of resources, which are critical components in maintaining cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2014-04-09 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Each country that receives funds through SCI's grant from DFID submits an annual budget for the program and SCI discusses with DFID how to allocate funds against these budgets.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that imposes a requirement on local stakeholders (country programs) to produce detailed annual budgets. Such requirements enable SCI to assess cost per treatment and allocate funds in a way that supports and demonstrates cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI believes that allocating unrestricted funds to countries with lower cost per treatment helps to demonstrate that its program is a highly cost effective intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This statement, while not directly describing an imposed requirement, highlights how cost per treatment is used as a metric to guide funding decisions. In combination with the budgeting requirement, it implies that gathering detailed local data (via imposed operational processes) is instrumental in achieving and maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI plans to develop a finance manual to be used by its field offices.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that SCI is instituting a standardized operational process for its local field offices. By imposing such requirements, the charity ensures that local stakeholders follow uniform financial practices, which can help in minimizing errors and inefficiencies – a practice likely to contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI develops a preventive chemotherapy plan with each country in order to create a projection of the number of treatments that each country might request. SCI then looks at these countries' actual treatment and budget requests to determine the total funding need for the year.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process requires country-level stakeholders to actively engage in planning by providing projected and actual treatment data along with budget requests. By aligning funding needs with real data from local stakeholders, SCI likely improves resource allocation and minimizes waste, thereby supporting sustained cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2015-04-27 Interview Notes.md
- **Quote:** Every August, African countries submit a request for the number of PZQ tablets they require for schistosomiasis treatment programs. Stakeholders meet in October or November to assess these requests and decide on allocations, taking into account PZQ availability. In 2015, countries requested a total of 140 million tablets, and Merck provided 105 million tablets. In 2016, donations will increase to 250 million tablets. A country's capacity to undertake successful treatment programs is a primary consideration. Requests from countries partnering with organizations such as SCI are more likely to be approved. Those with inadequate financial backing might receive fewer than they request.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process that requires local stakeholders (African countries) to formally submit detailed requests for PZQ tablets. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the process of vetting requests based on a country’s capacity and financial backing implies that ensuring only viable programs receive full allocations can lead to more efficient resource use and contribute indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Alternatively, SCI might request modifications to areas that could withstand some cost-cutting measures without reducing the number of planned treatments. Program managers would then discuss the modifications with country program staff and propose a reduced budget. Though budget trimming is often necessary, it can appear harsh and have negative consequences on SCI's relationships with program managers.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes an operational process in which SCI imposes requirements on local stakeholders, asking program managers and country staff to revise their budgets to achieve cost savings. While the text does not directly state that this improves cost effectiveness, it indicates that rigorous budget trimming is used as a strategy to manage costs, thereby contributing to the overall financial efficiency of the intervention.

- **Quote:** Professor Fenwick will chair the GSA's implementation working group. He expects to hold meetings with African program managers in mid-2015 to train them on the use of a standardized template for drug requests. It is hoped the GSA's work will facilitate collaboration between countries and stakeholders.
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights another operational process where local stakeholders (in this case, African program managers) are required to adopt a standardized template for drug requests. By standardizing procedures, the process aims to improve coordination and reduce errors, which is a mechanism that can enhance resource allocation efficiency and thus potentially support cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** SCI's role in mass drug administrations (MDAs) in general is to: Advocate for the benefits of mass drug distributions to government officials. Assist with planning and budgeting. Deliver funding and drugs to governments. Provide financial management and technical support. Develop procedures for monitoring and evaluation, analyze data, and write reports.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a series of operational processes that SCI requires local stakeholders (e.g., government officials and program implementers) to engage in. Such procedures—ranging from planning and budgeting to rigorous monitoring and evaluation—help ensure that resources are used efficiently and that performance is tracked, contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In 2015, SCI began to use a system of country cashbooks, which compare monthly in-country actual spending to budgets.
- **Reasoning:** This operational process imposes financial reporting and accountability requirements on local stakeholders. By monitoring actual spending against budgets on a monthly basis, SCI ensures that deviations are quickly identified and addressed, which is a key factor in maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Country programs that have more capacity and experience are likely to be those that both carry out high-quality distributions and complete all the steps necessary for coverage surveys to be implemented and the results shared with SCI (and thus with GiveWell).
- **Reasoning:** This statement highlights that local stakeholders are expected to meet specific operational requirements—such as implementing and reporting coverage surveys—in order to demonstrate high-quality program execution. Such requirements enable reliable evaluation of distribution effectiveness, which in turn supports accurate cost-effectiveness assessments.

- **Quote:** He noted that those carrying out mass drug administration should coordinate with school feeding programs when possible, and when this wasn't possible, should provide some food or at least use social mobilization to make sure kids know to eat first. He stated, "An upset stomach is a good sign, it means the PZQ is working, but vomiting is not, it means the PZQ is wasted."
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the operational process of requiring local stakeholders (e.g., school officials and drug administrators) to ensure children eat before drug administration helps reduce drug wastage. By imposing this requirement, the intervention safeguards the effectiveness of praziquantel, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The goal of mapping is to provide a cost-effective way to determine how much treatment is needed and the frequency of treatment required.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links an operational process—mapping for precise data collection and treatment planning—to cost effectiveness. Involving local stakeholders in mapping ensures that resources are allocated based on accurate prevalence data, preventing over- or under-treatment and enhancing the overall cost efficiency of the intervention.
