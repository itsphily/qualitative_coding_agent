## Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.

### Evidence #1

**Quote:** Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly's Ugandan program, GiveDirectly's capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote introduces the fact that a significant issue (fraud) occurred in a specific location (Uganda), highlighting that location-specific factors can impact the intervention. This is relevant to identifying and understanding location-specific factors and assessing their impact.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #2

**Quote:** There were three key people involved in the fraud: * GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process * GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls * Agents from the mobile money providers The fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly's Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote details the specific mechanisms of the fraud in Uganda, involving local staff roles (SFO, OM) and local payment agents. It illustrates how the local operational structure and personnel can become location-specific factors impacting the intervention's integrity. It shows the nature of the problem that required a calibrated response.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #3

**Quote:** Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud: * Because GiveDirectly's Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage. * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly identifies location-specific operational characteristics in Uganda (small program size leading to multi-role staff, coordinated paydays) as contributing factors to the fraud. This is direct evidence of identifying and understanding how location-specific factors impact the intervention's vulnerability.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #4

**Quote:** The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that the discovery of the fraud in Uganda (a location-specific issue) directly impacted the timing of the intervention's rollout in that location, causing a two-week delay. This is evidence of assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #5

**Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a specific modification to the operational structure in Uganda (separating roles, relocating hotline) as a direct response to the fraud, which was linked to staff having multiple roles due to the smaller program size in that location. It explicitly contrasts this with the structure in Kenya, showing an adaptation based on location-specific circumstances and lessons learned. This is evidence of modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities based on location factors.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #6

**Quote:** Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a change in procedure in Uganda (increasing audit frequency) as a direct response to the fraud, which occurred during paydays when the Field Director was not present. This is evidence of modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities based on location-specific vulnerabilities identified.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #7

**Quote:** Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a new procedure implemented in Uganda (real-time spot-checks) as a response to the fraud, aimed at monitoring paydays more closely. This is evidence of modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities based on location-specific issues.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #8

**Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a change in the payment method used in Uganda, switching to a provider with a larger agent network. This adaptation is explicitly based on the limitations of the previous provider's network in that location, which restricted recipient access to funds outside of coordinated paydays (a factor contributing to the fraud vulnerability). This is evidence of identifying location-specific factors (limited network) and modifying the intervention strategy/activities (changing provider) to be more responsive to the local context (recipient access).

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #9

**Quote:** Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the strategy of building a local informant network in Uganda, partly motivated by the need to prevent issues like fraudulent translation. This is an adaptation of the approach based on understanding local communication dynamics and vulnerabilities, aimed at ensuring the intervention is responsive to the local context and potential risks.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #10

**Quote:** Other instances of fraud GiveDirectly has experienced include: * Isolated incidents of M-Pesa agents asking for bribes or higher percentage fees for processing transactions. * Village Elders claiming to have brought GiveDirectly to their village or to have gotten a particular recipient on GiveDirectly's list and asking the recipient(s) for a gift in return. * There are likely some transfer recipients who are falsely claiming to live in structures that would make them eligible for GiveDirectly's program.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote provides examples of other types of fraud encountered, which are linked to location-specific factors such as the local payment system (M-Pesa agents), local power structures/social dynamics (Village Elders), and local information asymmetry/verification challenges (false eligibility claims). This is evidence of identifying and understanding various location-specific factors that impact the intervention's integrity.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #11

**Quote:** GiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government's requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government's formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly's work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly's recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly's work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote shows that obtaining government approvals (a location-specific factor) is a process that influences GiveDirectly's operations, including the time taken (longer in Kenya) and the need to comply with or negotiate requests (e.g., providing recipient lists). The decision not to provide the list is based on an assessment of potential risks within the local political context. This is evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors (government requirements, political context) and assessing their impact on the intervention's implementation and strategy.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #12

**Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly is considering modifying its geographic focus in Kenya based on location-specific demographic and political factors (ethnic concentrations) and the need to ensure the intervention is perceived as unbiased within the local context. This is evidence of identifying location-specific factors and considering modifying the strategy to be responsive to the local context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #13

**Quote:** It took 2.5 months to get this approval [Ugunja, Kenya]... It took about a month to get Bukedea approval [Uganda].

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly contrasts the time taken to get program approval in two different locations (Kenya and Uganda). This highlights location-specific differences in administrative processes, which are location-specific factors that impact the speed and ease of implementing the intervention. This is evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors and assessing their impact on the intervention's rollout.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #14

**Quote:** Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a deliberate strategy to differentiate the approach in Uganda compared to Kenya, designating Uganda for experimental projects and as a backup location. This decision is based on an assessment of location-specific characteristics (Uganda being potentially less efficient for standard operations but suitable for experiments and backup due to its separate context from Kenya). This is evidence of identifying location-specific factors (relative efficiency, political risk context) and modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities (using the location for different purposes) to be responsive to the overall strategic context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #15

**Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes an instance where the operational pace of the intervention (enrollment) was deliberately modified in a specific location (Kenya) to accommodate the needs of a research study. While the primary driver is research, it demonstrates an adaptation of the intervention's implementation based on external requirements specific to that location and study design. This is evidence of modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #16

**Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote serves as evidence for calibrating the approach based on location specifics. It explicitly states that GiveDirectly's board decided to increase transfer amounts in Kenya and index them for future inflation. This is a direct modification of the intervention (transfer size) based on a location-specific factor (inflation rate in Kenya). This demonstrates identifying and understanding a location-specific factor (inflation), assessing its impact (reduced value of transfers), and modifying/adapting the intervention strategy (raising and indexing transfer amounts) to be responsive to the local context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #17

**Quote:** In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote is strong evidence for calibrating the approach based on location specifics. It identifies a location-specific factor (thatch not commonly used in Homa Bay County) and states that, as a result, a different method for identifying eligible households (proxy means test) is required. This demonstrates identifying and understanding a location-specific factor, assessing its impact on the standard approach (thatch test is not effective here), and the need to modify/adapt the intervention strategy (use a different test) to be responsive to the local context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #18

**Quote:** Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly calibrates its operational approach based on location-specific factors. It describes identifying location-specific constraints in Uganda (limited cell phone penetration, distance to mobile agents) and assessing their impact (distributed cashout not feasible). Based on this assessment, they initially modified the intervention delivery strategy by starting with a payday model. The quote also shows ongoing efforts to adapt the distributed cashout model (communication about agent locations) to make it more effective in the Ugandan context, illustrating responsiveness to local conditions.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #19

**Quote:** In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly sets operational targets differently based on location. The efficiency target, while not the core cash transfer amount, is a key operational metric. Setting lower targets in Uganda due to higher initial costs demonstrates identifying and understanding location-specific factors (costs in Uganda) and modifying/adapting an operational strategy (efficiency targets) based on these factors.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #20

**Quote:** However, likelihood of crime might vary from region to region. GiveDirectly does not consider security risk to be very high in Homa Bay County, but acknowledges that it could be more of a concern in an urban area.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly identifying and assessing the impact of location-specific factors (region, rural vs. urban area) on a key operational risk (security). While it doesn't explicitly state a modification of the core cash transfer amount, it implies that operational strategies (like providing security or choosing payment models like distributed cashout, as mentioned elsewhere) are informed by this location-based risk assessment, demonstrating responsiveness to local context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #21

**Quote:** In the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:
* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents.
* Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.
* Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
* Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient's phone after the recipient passed away.
* Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
* Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly.
* Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Chronology:** after

**Reasoning:** This quote details the specific operational changes implemented by GiveDirectly in response to staff fraud that occurred during the Uganda pilot campaign. This serves as evidence of the charity modifying its intervention strategy and activities (e.g., changing cash out day management, introducing community monitors and informants, relocating the call center) as a direct response to a problem identified in a specific location (Uganda). This demonstrates assessing the impact of a location-specific issue (fraud) on the intervention and adapting the approach to be responsive to that local context.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #22

**Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes GiveDirectly's specific actions taken in response to a high level of gaming identified in a particular village in Kenya. Pausing transfers and holding a community meeting are modifications to the standard intervention process. This is evidence of adapting the intervention strategy and activities based on a problem specific to a particular location, thereby ensuring the intervention is responsive to the local context of high gaming in that village.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #23

**Quote:** In the Uganda 2M campaign, there was also one village with high levels of gaming. GiveDirectly mentioned two possible contributing factors: 1) the village was close to another village that had already received transfers, so it is likely that there was a higher level of awareness of GiveDirectly's targeting criteria at the outset, enabling people to pose as meeting the criteria from the census stage; 2) evidence that a corrupt staff member planted a false recipient in the village.

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote identifies potential reasons for high gaming in a specific village in Uganda. The first factor, proximity to another village that received transfers, is presented as a location-specific characteristic that may have influenced the level of gaming. This serves as evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors and assessing their potential impact on the intervention (specifically, the targeting process).

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #24

**Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:

*   **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes GiveDirectly's plan to test alternative methods for distributing cash transfers in locations where the standard mobile-payment infrastructure is lacking. This is direct evidence of the charity modifying its intervention strategy ("Methods for cash transfer distribution") based on a specific location-dependent factor ("areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure"). It shows an effort to adapt the program to the local context to ensure delivery is possible. The timing is described as a plan for 2016, which falls within the operational period of the cash transfer program.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #25

**Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This passage explains that GiveDirectly is changing its funding allocation plan, shifting some funds to Rwanda, due to potential regulatory challenges in Uganda. This demonstrates the charity identifying a location-specific factor (government regulations in Uganda) and modifying its operational strategy (funding allocation and country focus) in response to ensure the program can continue effectively elsewhere. This decision is being made during the operational planning period.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #26

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has seen an uptick in the rate of refusal to participate in its cash transfer program in Homa Bay. The root of this development is not clear, and GiveDirectly has not yet identified a solution. In some cases, community members are led by local religious leaders or local government to mistrust the program. In Siaya County, this issue did not arise, possibly because GiveDirectly covered such a large portion of the county that in any new area it entered, people were already aware of the program and knew that it was trustworthy.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights a difference in program reception between two locations, Homa Bay and Siaya. It identifies a location-specific factor (community mistrust potentially influenced by local leaders/government) that is impacting the intervention (increased refusal rate). The comparison to Siaya helps understand the context of this location-specific issue. This is an observation made during the program's operation.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #27

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program's purpose. In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion. For this reason, it has not attempted to re-enroll those who refused, but might do so in the future.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This passage describes the actions GiveDirectly took to address the location-specific issue of high refusal rates in Homa Bay (identified in the previous quote). Meeting with local leaders, using local radio, and accelerating transfers for some recipients are all modifications or adaptations to the intervention strategy specifically in response to the local context of mistrust. This occurred during the program's operation.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #28

**Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote states that GiveDirectly is using different targeting criteria in Homa Bay, Kenya, compared to Uganda. It explicitly mentions that the new criteria incorporated feedback from local focus groups in Homa Bay, indicating that the targeting strategy was modified based on location-specific input and understanding of local vulnerability factors. This is a clear example of adapting the intervention strategy based on local context. This process occurred before or during the enrollment phase in Homa Bay.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #29

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has found a poverty rate in Homa Bay similar to that of Siaya and Rarieda. However, more people in Homa Bay have metal roofs than in Siaya. This is likely because the grass for thatched roofs does not grow in Homa Bay, so the price of thatch is less competitive. This may mean that Homa Bay residents spend a higher percentage of their income on housing.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This passage identifies specific location-based differences between Homa Bay and Siaya (prevalence of metal roofs vs. thatched roofs, availability of thatch grass, potential housing costs). These are location-specific factors that could influence how cash transfers are used or the economic context recipients face. This demonstrates the identification and understanding of location-specific factors. This observation was made during the operational period in Homa Bay.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #30

**Quote:** Because Homa Bay residents are less likely to spend their cash transfers on roofs, the ROI from these transfers may differ from that seen in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly is generally not focused on ROI. Its first randomized controlled trial measured a wide range of indicators (including mental health, education, child nutrition, and income), and it has not closely examined ROI. Studies of the Homa Bay program, such as the Aspirations study, will collect basic consumption data, which GiveDirectly will eventually be able to use. However, Ms. Toth is not sure whether the Aspirations study will include a specific measure of ROI. Because Homa Bay is very similar to Siaya geographically, GiveDirectly is not concerned that its level of impact in Homa Bay will be lower.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote discusses how a location-specific factor (likelihood of spending on roofs, linked to roofing material availability/cost) might lead to a different outcome measure (ROI) in Homa Bay compared to Siaya. This shows an assessment of the potential impact of a location factor on the results of the intervention. Although GiveDirectly isn't focused on ROI, the consideration of how location might affect it is relevant. This assessment is being made during the operational period in Homa Bay.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #31

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes GiveDirectly's operational experience in Rwanda, highlighting a location-specific factor (government regulation) and how they adapted their approach (required close coordination and attention) to operate effectively within that context. This serves as evidence for identifying location-specific factors, assessing their impact, modifying activities, and ensuring responsiveness to the local context. The timing is during the intervention period as GiveDirectly is actively operating in Rwanda.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

### Evidence #32

**Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explains GiveDirectly's strategic decision regarding geographical expansion. It explicitly states that the decision not to expand is based on a location-specific factor (large poor populations in existing countries) and an assessment of its impact on cost efficiency. This is evidence of calibrating the approach (deciding where to focus operations) based on location-specific factors and their impact on operational cost-effectiveness. The timing is during the intervention period as this reflects their current strategic thinking.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #33

**Quote:** When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes one specific condition under which GiveDirectly would consider expanding to a new country. The condition is a location-specific factor (the need for policy research that can only happen there). This shows how a location-specific factor (research needs tied to a place) can trigger a modification of their strategy (expanding operations). The timing is during the intervention period as this reflects their current strategic thinking.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #34

**Quote:** When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes another condition for expansion: a location-specific requirement from a funder. This highlights how external location-specific factors (funder demands tied to a place) can influence GiveDirectly's strategy (expanding operations). The timing is during the intervention period as this reflects their current strategic thinking.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #35

**Quote:** When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a third condition for expansion: a large funder tied to a specific country, where the funding is significant enough to justify the cost of expanding operations to that location. This again shows how location-specific factors (funder presence and funding level tied to a place) and an assessment of their impact (benefit vs. cost) drive strategic decisions (expansion). The timing is during the intervention period as this reflects their current strategic thinking.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #36

**Quote:** Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments).

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explains why GiveDirectly is not pursuing partnerships with developing country governments. It identifies a location-specific factor (the desire of emerging market governments to control implementation) and assesses its impact on GiveDirectly's core value proposition (strong implementation control). This leads to a decision not to adapt their model (by handing over control) in response to this location-specific factor. This is evidence of considering location-specific factors and deciding not to modify the intervention strategy based on them, because it conflicts with their core operational model. The timing is during the intervention period as this reflects their current strategic thinking.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

## Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.

### Evidence #1

**Quote:** GiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the process of identifying specific geographic areas based on poverty levels ("poor enough to be eligible"). This is a data gathering process focused on understanding and selecting the context (poverty) where the charitable cause exists, which occurs before the intervention is implemented in those specific districts.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context

---

### Evidence #2

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote shows GiveDirectly considering socio-political factors (ethnicity, political bias) as part of the context when planning future program locations. This demonstrates a focus on understanding the broader context of the charitable cause before implementing the intervention in new areas. The consideration happens before the intervention in those specific areas.

**Aspect:**
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #3

**Quote:** Another partnership GiveDirectly explored was working with two large multilateral organizations to set up a comparison between cash transfers and cows in one country. GiveDirectly believed that while the potential for impact on government policy and recipient outcomes was high, the risks of moving into an unfamiliar area and using unfamiliar payment systems were too great. It was also unclear whether a large enough sample could be assembled for the cash transfer arm to constitute a scientifically credible study.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes GiveDirectly's assessment of a potential partnership *before* committing to it. It highlights the need to understand the local context ("unfamiliar area", "unfamiliar payment systems") and the potential recipient pool size ("large enough sample") to determine feasibility and scientific credibility. This is evidence of understanding the context and establishing a basis for a potential intervention, occurring before implementation.

**Aspect:**
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #4

**Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs. However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the process of identifying the potential pool of recipients (households) and securing necessary permissions from the government *before* enrolling recipients and delivering transfers. This is a crucial step in understanding the scale and context of the potential intervention area and occurs prior to implementation.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #5

**Quote:** GiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the process of identifying and evaluating other interventions in Rwanda to use as benchmarks for a new study. This involves understanding the existing landscape of aid programs in the local context, which is a form of establishing context *before* the study (intervention) begins.

**Aspect:**
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Establishing baseline/understanding context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #6

**Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed. GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote details GiveDirectly's process for determining eligibility criteria (proxy means tests) to identify poor households. This involves testing different data collection methods (thatched roofs, other metrics, community-based targeting) and evaluating their performance, including against existing baseline data. This is a clear example of data gathering and analysis to understand the context of poverty and establish criteria *before* selecting recipients for the intervention in a new area.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Establishing baseline/understanding context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #7

**Quote:** The rolling model places some pressure on academics to organize their studies in a way that fits into GiveDirectly's timeline. The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers... GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states the requirement for a baseline study/survey to be completed *before* token transfers are sent for research integrity. It describes the operational challenge this timing creates and GiveDirectly's decision to delay transfers to allow the baseline data collection to occur first. This is direct evidence of establishing a baseline through data collection occurring before the intervention.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Establishing baseline/understanding context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #8

**Quote:** the village was close to another village that had already received transfers, so it is likely that there was a higher level of awareness of GiveDirectly's targeting criteria at the outset, enabling people to pose as meeting the criteria from the census stage

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a factor contributing to gaming (ineligible people posing as eligible) that occurred during the "census stage" and "at the outset". The census stage is part of the data gathering process used to identify potential recipients before the intervention (cash transfers) begins. This relates to the 'Data gathering process', 'Timing before intervention implementation', and 'Establishing baseline/understanding context' aspects. It highlights a challenge in accurately collecting data and understanding the local context (awareness of criteria) during the pre-intervention phase. The cause identified is the proximity to a village that already received transfers, leading to increased awareness of targeting criteria among potential ineligible recipients, motivating them to game the system during the initial data collection phase.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #9

**Quote:** evidence that a corrupt staff member planted a false recipient in the village.

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes another factor contributing to gaming, specifically a corrupt staff member introducing a false recipient. This action would occur during the targeting or enrollment process, which happens before cash transfers are made. This relates to the 'Data gathering process' and 'Timing before intervention implementation' aspects, highlighting a potential vulnerability or issue within the data collection process itself during the pre-intervention phase. The motivation is explicitly stated as a "corrupt staff member". The action was to "plant a false recipient", which implies an intent to defraud the system by manipulating the recipient list during the pre-intervention data collection/enrollment phase.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #10

**Quote:** ...took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes a data gathering process (focus groups) that occurred before the targeting criteria for the intervention were finalized and tested. This demonstrates the collection of information about the charitable cause/context (identifying vulnerable groups like widows) prior to implementing the intervention with these new criteria. This fits the research code and all listed aspects. The timing is clearly "before" the intervention using these specific criteria.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #11

**Quote:** Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past.

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote mentions "Registration has gone well". Registration is an operational process that involves collecting information about potential recipients (the charitable cause) before they receive cash transfers (the intervention). This process constitutes a form of data gathering about the target population, occurs before the intervention is implemented, and contributes to understanding who the recipients are.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context
