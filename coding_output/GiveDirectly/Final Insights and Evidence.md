# Final Insights and Evidence

---

## Adaptation is Primarily Reactive and Operationally Focused, Driven by Problem-Solving

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly demonstrates significant agility in modifying its operational procedures (e.g., payment systems, fraud controls, targeting methods) and strategies in direct response to encountered challenges like fraud, infrastructure limitations, targeting inaccuracies, or community resistance. This adaptive capacity is a core strength. However, both reports indicate that these adaptations are more frequently triggered by issues already manifesting (reactive) rather than stemming from deep, proactive, systematic assessments of complex socio-cultural dynamics or potential multifaceted impacts *before* full-scale implementation. The `deep_synthesis_report` particularly highlights absences in proactive frameworks for socio-cultural profiling and impact assessment, while the `adjusted_summary` provides numerous examples of problem-triggered changes.

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote shows that the discovery of the fraud in Uganda (a location-specific issue) directly impacted the timing of the intervention's rollout in that location, causing a two-week delay. This is evidence of assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention.

---

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government's requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government's formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly's work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly's recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly's work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote shows that obtaining government approvals (a location-specific factor) is a process that influences GiveDirectly's operations, including the time taken (longer in Kenya) and the need to comply with or negotiate requests (e.g., providing recipient lists). The decision not to provide the list is based on an assessment of potential risks within the local political context. This is evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors (government requirements, political context) and assessing their impact on the intervention's implementation and strategy.

---

#### Evidence #3

**Evidence Quote:** In the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:
* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents.
* Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.
* Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
* Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient's phone after the recipient passed away.
* Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
* Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly.
* Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.

**Evidence Chronology:** after

**Doc Name:** Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details the specific operational changes implemented by GiveDirectly in response to staff fraud that occurred during the Uganda pilot campaign. This serves as evidence of the charity modifying its intervention strategy and activities (e.g., changing cash out day management, introducing community monitors and informants, relocating the call center) as a direct response to a problem identified in a specific location (Uganda). This demonstrates assessing the impact of a location-specific issue (fraud) on the intervention and adapting the approach to be responsive to that local context.

#### Evidence #4

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes GiveDirectly's operational experience in Rwanda, highlighting a location-specific factor (government regulation) and how they adapted their approach (required close coordination and attention) to operate effectively within that context. This serves as evidence for identifying location-specific factors, assessing their impact, modifying activities, and ensuring responsiveness to the local context. The timing is during the intervention period as GiveDirectly is actively operating in Rwanda.

---

#### Evidence #5

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the process of identifying and evaluating other interventions in Rwanda to use as benchmarks for a new study. This involves understanding the existing landscape of aid programs in the local context, which is a form of establishing context *before* the study (intervention) begins.

## Targeting and Factor Identification Methods Evolve, but Proactive Holistic Contextual Understanding is Limited

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly shows a clear evolution in its methods for identifying location-specific factors (like housing materials or infrastructure) and refining its poverty targeting criteria, moving from simpler proxies (e.g., "thatched roofs") towards more context-sensitive approaches informed by local realities and feedback (e.g., Homa Bay criteria). The `adjusted_summary` confirms this through 'Tailoring Targeting and Eligibility Methods'. However, the `deep_synthesis_report` underscores that despite this evolution, there's a lack of systematic, proactive methodologies for in-depth socio-cultural profiling, understanding nuanced community power structures, or assessing potential cultural resistances *before* issues arise or programs are fully designed. Much deep understanding appears to be acquired reactively.

### Related Evidence

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** There were three key people involved in the fraud: * GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process * GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls * Agents from the mobile money providers The fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly's Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details the specific mechanisms of the fraud in Uganda, involving local staff roles (SFO, OM) and local payment agents. It illustrates how the local operational structure and personnel can become location-specific factors impacting the intervention's integrity. It shows the nature of the problem that required a calibrated response.

#### Evidence #4

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote shows GiveDirectly identifying geographic areas based on poverty levels before implementation, reflecting a proactive but simple targeting method that aligns with the insight's discussion of evolving methods for identifying location-specific factors and refining poverty targeting criteria.

---

#### Evidence #5

**Evidence Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed. GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details GiveDirectly's process for determining eligibility criteria (proxy means tests) to identify poor households. This involves testing different data collection methods (thatched roofs, other metrics, community-based targeting) and evaluating their performance, including against existing baseline data. This is a clear example of data gathering and analysis to understand the context of poverty and establish criteria before selecting recipients for the intervention in a new area.

---

## Operational and Support Responsiveness is Strong; Community Co-Design of Core Intervention is Limited

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly effectively tailors its operational execution to local contexts, evident in adapting payment logistics, implementing fraud prevention measures responsive to local risks, adjusting transfer values for inflation, and providing support systems for vulnerable individuals (e.g., trustee system). The `adjusted_summary` details these through various themes. The `deep_synthesis_report` (Aspect 4) confirms this operational responsiveness. However, both reports, particularly the `deep_synthesis_report`, indicate a significant gap in systematically eliciting or incorporating broader community preferences into the fundamental design of the cash transfer intervention itself or into ongoing program governance beyond specific research or crisis response. Responsiveness is primarily about *how* the pre-defined intervention is delivered, not about *what* the core intervention could be based on collective local desires.

### Related Evidence

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud: * Because GiveDirectly's Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage. * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote explicitly identifies location-specific operational characteristics in Uganda (small program size leading to multi-role staff, coordinated paydays) as contributing factors to the fraud. This is direct evidence of identifying and understanding how location-specific factors impact the intervention's vulnerability.

## Calibration Extends to Strategic Country-Level Decisions for Risk and Resource Management

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly's approach to calibrating its intervention is not confined to field-level operational adjustments but also encompasses strategic decisions at the country and cross-country level. This includes adapting to differing governmental and political landscapes, making choices about program expansion or pauses based on regulatory climates (e.g., Uganda/Rwanda contingency), using specific country operations for experimental learning, and balancing cost-efficiency in existing areas against opportunities in new ones. The `adjusted_summary` highlights this through 'Strategic Decisions on Country Presence and Expansion' and strong claims, while the `deep_synthesis_report` notes navigating government approvals and strategic adjustments as recurrent patterns.

#### Evidence #1

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time.

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote demonstrates GiveDirectly navigating and adapting to government approval processes in different countries, reflecting strategic country-level decision-making on regulatory engagement and risk management.

---

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md

The timing is during the intervention period as GiveDirectly is actively operating in Rwanda.

---

#### Evidence #4

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the process of identifying and evaluating other interventions in Rwanda to use as benchmarks for a new study. This involves understanding the existing landscape of aid programs in the local context, which is a form of establishing context before the study (intervention) begins.

## Adaptation Balances Centralized Standards with Decentralized Local Intelligence

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly's model for adapting to local contexts involves a dynamic interplay between maintaining centralized control over core program standards, integrity, and efficiency, and leveraging decentralized, local intelligence and feedback. The `adjusted_summary` points to 'Centralised Oversight Coupled with Local Intelligence,' citing examples like centralizing hotlines while using community monitors. The `deep_synthesis_report` shows this in the evolution of informant networks post-fraud and the use of focus groups for targeting. However, it also notes a divergence where community input is valued for some information (e.g., fraud detection) but deemed less reliable for others (e.g., community-based targeting for eligibility), suggesting that while local input informs adaptation, the framework for decision-making and core model fidelity remains centrally managed.

---

## Structured and Adaptive Data Collection Prioritizes Efficient Poverty Targeting

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly employs a systematic, multi-stage pre-intervention data collection process (e.g., geographic mapping, census, enrollment, backchecks) primarily focused on identifying extreme poverty through observable, adaptable proxy indicators, most notably housing materials. This process is iterative, with targeting criteria (like the 'thatched roof' standard) evolving based on local context (e.g., Homa Bay where thatch is uncommon) and internal testing and learning, including qualitative feedback from focus groups. This approach balances the need for scalable, cost-effective targeting with context-specific accuracy.

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

#### Evidence #3

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote describes the process of identifying specific geographic areas based on poverty levels ("poor enough to be eligible"). This is a data gathering process focused on understanding and selecting the context (poverty) where the charitable cause exists, which occurs before the intervention is implemented in those specific districts.

---

#### Evidence #4

**Evidence Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed. GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well.

**Evidence Chronology:** before

**Doc Name:** Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details GiveDirectly's process for determining eligibility criteria (proxy means tests) to identify poor households. It involves testing different data collection methods and evaluating their performance, including against existing baseline data, reflecting the iterative adaptation of proxy indicators based on local context.

## Research Integrity Drives Pre-Intervention Data Collection and Timelines

**Insight Explanation:** A significant driver for GiveDirectly's pre-intervention data collection is the establishment of robust baselines for rigorous academic research studies evaluating program impact. This commitment to research integrity is central, to the extent that GiveDirectly has intentionally delayed intervention timelines (e.g., token transfers) to ensure adequate time for comprehensive baseline data gathering by research teams. This highlights an acknowledged operational tension between the desire for rapid program delivery and the methodical pace required for rigorous research.

## Operational Data Focuses on Eligibility; Broader Contextual Data Limited Outside Research

**Insight Explanation:** While pre-intervention data collection for formal research studies is comprehensive, routine operational data gathering for all potential recipients primarily focuses on determining eligibility for cash transfers using simple, verifiable proxies. There is limited evidence of systematic collection of broader socio-economic or nuanced contextual data (e.g., detailed income sources, local market dynamics beyond payment infrastructure) for non-research purposes or for tailoring the intervention itself. This targeted approach aligns with GiveDirectly's model of delivering unconditional cash transfers cost-effectively and at scale.

## Proactive Risk Management and Iterative Process Improvement Define Data Collection Evolution

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly's pre-intervention data collection processes are significantly shaped by proactive risk management (e.g., addressing recipient misrepresentation, staff misconduct, political-ethnic neutrality concerns) and continuous operational learning. This is evident in the evolution of these processes, such as strengthened oversight and role separation following fraud incidents in Uganda, the planned integration of technology (e.g., Segovia) to enhance data management and fraud detection, and ongoing refinements to targeting and registration procedures to improve efficiency and integrity.

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government's requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government's formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly's work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly's recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly's work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it.

**Evidence Chronology:** during

**Doc Name:** Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote shows that obtaining government approvals (a location-specific factor) is a process that influences GiveDirectly's operations, including the time taken (longer in Kenya) and the need to comply with or negotiate requests (e.g., providing recipient lists). The decision not to provide the list is based on an assessment of potential risks within the local political context. This is evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors (government requirements, political context) and assessing their impact on the intervention's implementation and strategy.

---

#### Evidence #3

**Evidence Quote:** In the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:
* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents.
* Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.
* Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (~$4) for their time during a cash out day.
* Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient's phone after the recipient passed away.
* Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.
* Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly.
* Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent's account.

**Original Reasoning for Quote:** This quote details the specific operational changes implemented by GiveDirectly in response to staff fraud that occurred during the Uganda pilot campaign. This serves as evidence of the charity modifying its intervention strategy and activities (e.g., changing cash out day management, introducing community monitors and informants, relocating the call center) as a direct response to a problem identified in a specific location (Uganda). This demonstrates assessing the impact of a location-specific issue (fraud) on the intervention and adapting the approach to be responsive to that local context.

## Community Input: Ineffective for Initial Targeting but Valuable for Monitoring and Contextual Feedback

**Insight Explanation:** Analysis reveals a nuanced role for community input in pre-intervention data collection. While GiveDirectly's empirical evidence suggests that community-based *targeting* (relying on community reports for initial eligibility screening) has not performed well due to issues like inconsistent responses, community input is nevertheless valued and utilized in other capacities. This includes gathering qualitative feedback from focus groups to refine targeting criteria (e.g., identifying vulnerable groups like widows) and, as demonstrated post-fraud in Uganda, potentially incorporating community-nominated monitors for ongoing oversight and information gathering.

## Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Shapes Pre-Intervention Strategy and Operations

**Insight Explanation:** GiveDirectly's pre-intervention data collection strategies, site selection, and operational plans are influenced by a variety of stakeholders. These include national and local government bodies (whose approvals are critical and can involve lengthy negotiations and conditions), institutional funding partners (who may influence geographic focus or research priorities), academic collaborators (whose research requirements shape baseline data needs and timelines), and feedback from community members (which can inform the refinement of targeting criteria). This multi-stakeholder environment necessitates careful navigation and balancing of diverse priorities.

#### Evidence #2

**Evidence Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.
