## Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.

### Evidence #1

**Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities.

**Doc Name:** 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote serves as evidence for calibrating the approach by showing how Malaria Consortium adapts its partnership strategy based on the specific location (Uganda) and the existing local infrastructure and actors (local CBOs, Ministry of Health, district facilities). This demonstrates modifying the intervention strategy and ensuring responsiveness to the local context. The timing relative to the specific SMC intervention is unclear from the text.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #2

**Quote:** We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.

**Doc Name:** 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of identifying and understanding location-specific factors and assessing their impact on an intervention (net distribution). By asking detailed questions about why nets aren't used (e.g., lack of tools), they are investigating specific local barriers that affect the intervention's effectiveness. This process of "drilling down" is key to understanding the local context. The timing relative to the specific SMC intervention is unclear as this describes a general M&E approach.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #3

**Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.

**Doc Name:** 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote is strong evidence for calibrating the approach based on location-specific factors. The inSCALE project explicitly identifies a local factor (health worker attrition), assesses its impact on the intervention (service delivery), modifies the strategy by piloting solutions tailored to local needs (motivation, support), and plans to scale up successful adaptations with local government support. This directly addresses identifying factors, assessing impact, modifying strategy, and ensuring responsiveness to local context. The timing relative to the specific SMC intervention is unclear.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #4

**Quote:** My understanding of why donors come to us is that we're trusted as an organization that takes a fairly self-critical approach to finding out what works or doesn't work and applying that knowledge to improve the effectiveness of our initiatives.

**Doc Name:** 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a general organizational principle of learning and adaptation based on evidence ("finding out what works or doesn't work"). While not explicitly tied to location, this self-critical approach and application of knowledge are fundamental to the process of calibrating interventions, which would include adapting based on location-specific findings about effectiveness or barriers. It relates to assessing impact and modifying strategies. The timing relative to the specific SMC intervention is unclear.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #5

**Quote:** In some previous SMC projects in Katsina State, Nigeria, this was more likely to occur during fixed-point deliveries due to the large number of individuals congregating in a single location.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote identifies a location-specific factor (large congregations at fixed points in Katsina State) that negatively impacted a key part of the intervention (observing the first dose). This demonstrates the process of identifying and understanding how local specifics affect intervention delivery. The timing is described as "previous projects", indicating it occurred before the main intervention period discussed in the rest of the text.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #6

**Quote:** In some districts, a strong demand for SMC resulted in an unstable denominator in the surveys. Some individuals moved from neighboring districts in order to be able to participate and moved back to their home districts at the end of the treatment cycle.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote describes how location-specific factors (differences in demand/access between neighboring districts leading to migration) impacted the accuracy of data collection related to the intervention. While primarily affecting measurement, it highlights the need to understand local dynamics that influence participation and data reliability, which is part of calibrating the overall approach to be effective in a specific location. The surveys occurred during or after intervention cycles.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #7

**Quote:** In certain areas, the surveys observed migration patterns that had not previously been described, which were largely due to agricultural practices. Malaria Consortium returned to these areas to do more qualitative exploration to learn about the causes of this migration.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly describes identifying previously unknown location-specific factors (migration patterns linked to agricultural practices in certain areas) through surveys and subsequent qualitative exploration. This is a clear example of the process of understanding local context to inform intervention strategy. This exploration happened during the period of the intervention cycles being discussed (leading to changes implemented in 2016).

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #8

**Quote:** On the basis of these explorations, Malaria Consortium put together the following list of improvements to its intervention and measurement methods, which it implemented during the 2016 transmission season:

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote introduces the direct result of understanding location-specific migration patterns: a list of adaptations made to the intervention strategy and measurement methods. The subsequent text details specific changes like adjusting guides for mobile populations, synchronizing implementation across borders, and engaging with migrant associations to provide mobile fixed points. This demonstrates modifying the intervention and ensuring it is responsive to the local context identified. These changes were implemented during the 2016 intervention season.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #9

**Quote:** Due to behavioral factors, some of these methods may work better than others in certain settings, so it seems valuable to continue to collect data in all of these ways.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** after

**Reasoning:** This quote acknowledges that location-specific factors ("certain settings") influence the effectiveness of different data collection methods used within the intervention's monitoring framework. While focused on measurement, it implies that the choice or combination of methods needs to be responsive to local context and behavior, which is a form of calibrating the approach based on location specifics. This discusses future plans, so it is after the 2016 season.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #10

**Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes adapting a tool used in the intervention (SMC card) based on feedback gathered from testing it in different locations ("different countries"). This demonstrates identifying location-specific feedback (from different countries) and using it to modify a component of the intervention's operational process. This pretesting occurred before the main intervention rollout.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #11

**Quote:** However, not all individuals had been informed that they needed to keep the SMC blister packs, so Malaria Consortium was not able to do all of the relevant cross checks. Going forward, Malaria Consortium will ensure that this information is communicated in advance of the intervention.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a finding from a specific location (Katsina State, mentioned in the preceding paragraph) where a lack of communication about keeping blister packs hindered monitoring. Based on this location-specific finding, Malaria Consortium decided to modify its communication strategy for future interventions. This demonstrates identifying a location-specific issue and adapting the intervention's communication approach in response. This finding and decision occurred during or after the Katsina project, which was before the main intervention period discussed.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #12

**Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes actively seeking out and utilizing location-specific resources (existing household registers in specific geographical areas) to adapt and simplify a tool used in the intervention (household registration tool). This is a clear example of identifying and understanding location-specific factors (existing tools) and using them to modify the intervention's operational tools, making the approach responsive to the local context. This process occurred during the program rollout, which precedes or is part of the intervention setup.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #13

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explains the criteria used to select countries for the LLIN scoping work. These criteria are location-specific factors (malaria burden, transmission season timing, COVID-19 overlap, LLIN campaign timelines, existing staff presence). This demonstrates the process of "Identifying and understanding location-specific factors" and how these factors influence the decision-making process for where to potentially implement an intervention, thus relating to "Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context". The timing is "before" any potential LLIN intervention and before or during the planning for the next SMC season, as the grant activities occurred in May-June 2020.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #14

**Quote:** Nigeria, Uganda, and Mozambique have high rates of malaria transmission. Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote reiterates two key location-specific factors used in selecting countries for scoping: high malaria transmission rates and existing local presence (offices, relationships). This further exemplifies "Identifying and understanding location-specific factors" and how existing local infrastructure is considered, linking to "Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context" by leveraging existing resources. The timing is "before" potential LLIN interventions.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #15

**Quote:** Additionally, we believed it was possible that the COVID-19 pandemic would divert resources away from malaria prevention efforts at a time when they may have been more needed (if COVID-19 caused disruptions in malaria treatment).

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights the consideration of a specific, potentially location-dependent factor (the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) and its potential effect on the need for malaria prevention interventions. This demonstrates "Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention" (how COVID-19 impacts need/resources) and "Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context" (by considering the local pandemic situation). The timing is "before" potential LLIN interventions, as this was part of the rationale for the scoping grant.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #16

**Quote:** The suitability of an area for SMC is determined by the seasonal pattern of rainfall, malaria transmission and the burden of malaria.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explains the criteria used to select areas for the SMC intervention. These criteria (seasonal pattern, transmission, burden) are location-specific factors that are identified and understood *before* implementing the program. This is a fundamental step in calibrating the approach by deciding where the intervention is appropriate and likely to be effective.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #17

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the payment rate for Community Distributors, a key operational cost and component of the delivery strategy, varies by country. This is an adaptation or modification of the intervention's operational details based on a location-specific factor (the country). This variation likely reflects differences in local economic conditions or standard practices.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #18

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are trained to follow a checklist on an illustrated job aid, which is translated into local languages,

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote highlights the translation of job aids into local languages. This is a direct adaptation of program materials to the local context (language spoken by CDs and caregivers), ensuring the intervention is responsive and understandable at the community level.

**Aspect:**
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities
- Ensuring the intervention is responsive to local context

---

### Evidence #19

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that there are several challenges with delivering SMC, including insecurity, flooding, and road access during the rainy season, as well as conflicting community health campaigns, such as vaccination campaigns.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote lists various challenges encountered during SMC delivery. These challenges (insecurity, flooding, road access, conflicting campaigns) are location-specific factors that impact the implementation of the intervention. Identifying these challenges is part of understanding the local context and assessing how these factors affect the intervention's delivery.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #20

**Quote:** The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) provided about $1.7 million to Malaria Consortium to do operational research on the best way to deliver SMC at scale in Katsina state in northern Nigeria, and then to implement its chosen delivery system and assess its efficiency and impact.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes operational research conducted in a specific location (northern Nigeria) to determine the "best way to deliver SMC at scale." This research aims to identify location-specific factors influencing delivery and use those findings to modify or adapt the intervention strategy for scaling up in that context.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #21

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explicitly states that location-specific assessments (malaria burden, transmission/rainfall patterns, incidence, seasonality) were conducted *before* starting the ACCESS-SMC program in specific countries. This is a clear example of identifying and understanding location factors to inform the decision of where and how to implement the intervention.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors

---

### Evidence #22

**Quote:** In the most recent program year, 2019, post-round surveys measured average coverage across cycles at 89% in Burkina Faso, 69% in Chad, and 68% in Nigeria.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** during

**Reasoning:** This quote presents coverage results broken down by country. The variation in coverage rates across Burkina Faso, Chad, and Nigeria demonstrates that location-specific factors influence the outcome (reach) of the intervention. Assessing these differential impacts by location is crucial for understanding where the program is more or less effective and can inform future calibration efforts.

**Aspect:**
- Assessing the impact of location factors on the intervention

---

### Evidence #23

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium has identified opportunities to spend up to $141.2 million to support its work in its current countries of operation (Burkina Faso, Chad, Nigeria, and Togo) in 2021-23... $1.3 million to expand its SMC program in Chad in 2022 and maintain that expansion in 2023.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** unclear

**Reasoning:** This quote discusses future spending opportunities and explicitly mentions an expansion of the SMC program in Chad. This indicates strategic decisions about where to focus resources and scale the intervention, which is influenced by location-specific factors like funding availability (discussed elsewhere) and potentially the perceived need or opportunity in that specific country. This represents a strategic calibration of the intervention's scale and location.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

### Evidence #24

**Quote:** On the other hand, revised SMC eligibility criteria may lead to the adoption of a fifth SMC cycle in some areas that implement SMC, expansion of eligibility to new areas within countries that implement SMC, and adoption of SMC by countries that do not currently implement SMC.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** after

**Reasoning:** This quote discusses potential future changes to the SMC program design, such as adding a fifth cycle or expanding to new areas/countries. These changes would be based on location-specific factors like the length of the malaria season (for a fifth cycle) or suitability criteria for new areas/countries. This illustrates how the intervention strategy can be modified or adapted based on the specific characteristics of different locations.

**Aspect:**
- Identifying and understanding location-specific factors
- Modifying or adapting the intervention strategy/activities

---

## Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.

### Evidence #1

**Quote:** Once a final version was created, Malaria Consortium used monitoring tools to test the card's efficacy as a means of measuring coverage during its project in Katsina State, Nigeria, which was a smaller-scale intervention in a more controlled environment than its current programs.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes testing the efficacy of the SMC card as a data collection tool during a smaller, earlier project in Katsina State. This earlier project served as research and development ('R&D') for the current, larger programs. Therefore, the data collection and monitoring activities during the Katsina project are considered pre-intervention data collection relative to the current large-scale intervention. It demonstrates a data gathering process conducted before the main intervention rollout to understand how a tool performs in a real-world setting.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #2

**Quote:** In order to determine whether SMC cards were representative of coverage in its program in Katsina State, Malaria Consortium conducted structured observations in the field immediately after each cycle. Supervisors visited households with a checklist, looking at specific responses on the SMC cards, asking individuals to confirm whether they had taken the two subsequent tablets of AQ or not, and, where possible, checking the blister packs.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote details specific data gathering methods (structured observations, checklists, asking individuals, checking blister packs) used during the earlier Katsina State project. As this project was R&D for the current large-scale intervention, these activities represent pre-intervention data collection aimed at understanding the effectiveness of data tools and coverage in a pilot setting. This highlights the data gathering process employed before the main intervention.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #3

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium gathered the supervisors' checklists at the end of each cycle and consolidated the findings, which included information on the SMC card, the blister packs, and individuals' responses to survey questions. Malaria Consortium conducted a focus group with the supervisors to discuss and explain the findings.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the process of collecting, consolidating, and analyzing data (checklists, survey responses, blister pack info) and conducting further data gathering (focus group) after cycles in the Katsina State R&D project. These activities are part of the data gathering process conducted before the current large-scale intervention, aimed at understanding the results and challenges from the pilot program.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #4

**Quote:** In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote explains how Malaria Consortium utilized existing data sources/tools (household registers from other programs) found during their pre-rollout research. This is a form of data gathering and leveraging existing contextual information before implementing their specific SMC intervention, demonstrating a focus on the local context and existing data infrastructure.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #5

**Quote:** Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.

**Doc Name:** 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes the pre-testing of the household registration tool. This activity occurred before the tool was used in the main intervention rollout, serving as a data gathering process to refine the tool design based on testing. This is evidence of pre-intervention data collection focused on preparing for the intervention.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation

---

### Evidence #6

**Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a process of collecting information ("data gathering process") about the context ("funding situation for LLIN campaigns") before potential intervention implementation (funding LLIN campaigns). This aligns with the research code "Pre-intervention data collection" and several aspects (Data gathering process, Focus on the charitable cause/context, Timing before intervention implementation, Establishing baseline/understanding context). However, it is crucial to note that this data collection is explicitly for LLIN campaigns, not for the Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) program, which is the specified intervention for this research. While not directly about the SMC program, it provides evidence of the organization's engagement in pre-intervention scoping and data collection activities in a related area (malaria prevention). The timing is clearly "before" any potential funding or implementation of the LLIN campaigns being scoped.

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Focus on the charitable cause/context
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context

---

### Evidence #7

**Quote:** In 2015, ACCESS-SMC funded a baseline study of the prevalence of gene mutations in malaria parasites that are markers of drug resistance for the drugs used in SMC.

**Doc Name:** 2021 GiveWell Summary.md

**Chronology:** before

**Reasoning:** This quote describes a "baseline study" conducted in 2015, which is before or at the very beginning of the ACCESS-SMC implementation period (2015-2017). A baseline study is a form of data collection ("Data gathering process") conducted *before* an intervention to establish initial conditions ("Establishing baseline/understanding context"). While focused on a potential negative impact (drug resistance), it is still data collected about the context relevant to the intervention's potential long-term effects. The timing is "before" the main scale-up of drug distribution under ACCESS-SMC. It relates to "Data gathering process", "Timing before intervention implementation", and "Establishing baseline/understanding context".

**Aspect:**
- Data gathering process
- Timing before intervention implementation
- Establishing baseline/understanding context
