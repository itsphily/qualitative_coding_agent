# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
The evidence for GiveDirectly reveals a highly adaptive approach to operational processes that are carefully calibrated to local contexts, and these adjustments ultimately support cost-effectiveness across different regions. Examining the quote/reasoning pairs shows several interlinked themes that answer the research question, “What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”

1. Organizational Restructuring to Prevent Conflicts and Fraud  
Several quotes focus on how GiveDirectly reconfigures its internal structure to minimize risks and ensure better oversight. For instance, one quote explains that “separating jobs that were previously done by one person…[by moving] the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kampala” is a strategic step. The reasoning clarifies that this separation “prevents conflicts of interest and fraud” by distancing oversight personnel from field staff. A very similar example is provided when the call center itself is moved to Kampala, distancing it from field operations in Mbale. In both instances, GiveDirectly leverages geographic separation within its operations to maintain multiple checks against inefficiency and fraud—an approach that reduces the likelihood of costly errors and mismanagement.

2. Adapting Financial Transfer Mechanisms According to Local Infrastructure  
Another major theme is the organization’s ability to adjust its methods for transferring funds based on local service availability. One quote describes a switch from EZEE Money to MTN Mobile Money because “The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited,” whereas MTN has a broader reach. The reasoning emphasizes that by selecting a platform with a larger network, GiveDirectly directly addresses the infrastructural challenges that could otherwise lead to bottlenecks or delays, thereby ensuring that cash transfers are completed efficiently. This adaptability in channel selection directly relates to cost-effectiveness by minimizing additional expenses and operational delays in transferring funds.

3. Contextualizing Eligibility and Targeting Processes  
GiveDirectly also demonstrates a flexible and evidence-driven testing of its targeting methods. One quote explains that using a thatched roof as a proxy test for extreme poverty works well in some areas but not in others—“in Homa Bay County… thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.” The rationale here is that if the indicators are not locally accurate, resource allocation may be inefficient. Similarly, another quote discusses how new targeting criteria are implemented in Homa Bay County based on focus group feedback that stressed the importance of including certain vulnerable groups like widows. In both cases, adapting target criteria to the local context minimizes the risk of misidentification and inefficiency. By ensuring that assistance reaches those who need it most, GiveDirectly leverages local knowledge to safeguard the value of its interventions.

4. Adjusting Financial Values to Local Economic Realities  
A particularly illuminating operational process is seen in how GiveDirectly handles inflation and transfer value. One quote details that transfers in Kenya were previously maintained constant in local currency despite rising costs. In response, the board decided to “raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%” and institute an indexing process for future transfers based on inflation reviews. This systematic adjustment ensures that the real value of the transfers stays preserved even as local costs increase. The reasoning underscores that by maintaining the purchasing power of transfers, the charity protects the effectiveness of its intervention and reduces the risk of inefficiencies arising from economic shifts.

5. Tailoring Operations in Response to Geographic and Infrastructure Challenges  
The evidence further demonstrates that GiveDirectly does not take a one‐size‐fits-all approach. For areas that lack robust mobile-payment infrastructure, one quote details an alternative operational model, where GiveDirectly plans to “alert mobile-money agents in other areas” and even work with local community members as informal agents. This flexibility in operational strategy helps them bypass the high costs of creating proprietary infrastructure, thereby directly contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

6. Strategic Decisions on Geographic Scope and Expansion  
An important strategic process is the decision-making around geographic expansion. One quote makes it clear that GiveDirectly “does not see expansion to other countries as a priority,” because “There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates.” Instead, expansion is only considered under very specific circumstances such as unique research needs or when a large funder is involved. This careful deliberation about where and when to expand ensures that resources are not spread too thinly, and that operational processes remain streamlined and cost effective within established regions.

7. Complying with Local Regulatory Requirements  
Lastly, adaptation isn’t limited to internal operational processes; it extends to regulatory environments as well. In Rwanda, for example, GiveDirectly quickly increased its operational capacity while ensuring close coordination with the president’s office—a necessary adjustment to a tightly regulated environment. The reasoning provided illustrates that compliance with local regulations can facilitate smoother operations while avoiding additional costs that might be incurred if noncompliance issues arose.

In conclusion, the evidence shows that GiveDirectly’s cost-effectiveness is largely enabled by a suite of operational processes that adjust to diverse local challenges. Each process—from the geographical restructuring of roles and the strategic selection between financial service providers to the continuous reexamination of targeting criteria and transfer values—demonstrates a profound sensitivity to local contexts. These adaptations reduce risks of fraud, misallocation of resources, or inefficiencies emerging from outdated operational models. For example, moving the complaint hotline and call center away from field staff (as mentioned in two separate quotes) directly limits conflicts of interest, while the switch to MTN Mobile Money ensures that recipients have better options for cash-out, even in areas with limited access to financial agents. Similarly, indexing transfers to inflation in Kenya illustrates a proactive response to economic shifts that safeguards the transfer’s real value over time.  

Overall, these operational processes—whether through tailored infrastructure adaptation, responsive financial policies, or strategic geographical limitations—directly contribute to the charity’s cost effectiveness. They exemplify how a charity’s operational agility and local responsiveness can serve as critical drivers of efficiency and impact, effectively answering the research question by showing that locally informed, adaptive operational processes are key enablers of cost-effective charitable work.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
The evidence from GiveDirectly’s documented operational decisions highlights a clear pattern: pre‐intervention data collection processes—such as baseline surveys, census stages, and focus groups—play a critical role in shaping operational workflows that are intended to underpin long‐term cost effectiveness.

One prominent theme is the active modification of service timelines to secure robust baseline data. For example, one quote states, “At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.” The associated reasoning emphasizes that this deliberate slowdown was implemented so that comprehensive pre‐intervention data could be collected. In another instance, when operations in Siaya accelerated too quickly, GiveDirectly was forced to delay token transfers to ensure that the GE team could complete a necessary baseline survey. The quote explains, “GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey... not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study.” Both examples illustrate that adjusting the pace of operations—whether by slowing down enrollment or delaying transfers—is a strategic process designed to maintain data quality and study integrity. These alterations are fundamental operational processes that support cost effectiveness by ensuring that subsequent evaluations and randomization integrity remain sound, which in turn prevents costly missteps later in the intervention.

A second emerging insight is the role of pre-intervention processes in shaping beneficiary targeting. In the Uganda 2M campaign, one quote highlights issues encountered during the census stage, “there was also one village with high levels of gaming.” The evidence notes two factors: first, proximity to a village where transfers had already occurred increased community awareness of targeting criteria, and second, a corrupt staff member had inserted a false recipient. This suggests that while pre‐intervention data collection (the census stage) is intended to set clear targeting standards, if not managed carefully, it can inadvertently lead to gaming of the system. Such gaming risks skewing beneficiary identification, potentially driving up costs through inefficiencies and misallocation of resources. Thus, the operational process of data gathering must also include robust checks to mitigate these risks.

A third theme is the refinement of targeting criteria via qualitative feedback gathered before full implementation. The quote, “All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria... The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group)” confirms that GiveDirectly uses pre-intervention focus groups not only to understand community needs but also to update targeting processes. The reasoning here makes it clear that incorporating such feedback is expected to optimize operations by precisely identifying vulnerable groups—improving efficiency and thus contributing to cost effectiveness.

Connecting these themes directly to the research question—“What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”—the evidence suggests that deliberate and adaptive modifications in operational workflows, particularly those driven by early data collection, are central to effective cost management. By deliberately slowing enrollment or delaying transfers to achieve reliable baseline surveys, GiveDirectly safeguards the integrity of its research and intervention strategies. This foundational step ensures that cost-effectiveness evaluations are based on robust data and that subsequent implementations reach the appropriate recipients. Similarly, by refining targeting criteria through pre-intervention feedback, the organization minimizes leakage of resources to non-eligible beneficiaries, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

Nonetheless, the evidence also points to potential pitfalls—most notably in the instance of gaming during the census stage in Uganda. While the pre-intervention process aimed to accurately capture necessary household data, it inadvertently increased the system’s vulnerability to manipulation. This discrepancy underscores an important nuance: operational processes that facilitate data collection and targeting can also introduce risks if not accompanied by measures to counteract unintended consequences. In this case, the increased awareness of targeting criteria led some to falsely meet the criteria, potentially undermining the cost-effectiveness gains the process was intended to secure.

In conclusion, the synthesis of these quotes reveals that GiveDirectly has built operational processes that are closely intertwined with pre-intervention data collection. By prioritizing the collection of reliable baseline data—whether it is through slowing enrollment, delaying token transfers, or integrating focus group feedback—GiveDirectly aims to create a foundation for cost-effective interventions where beneficiaries are properly targeted and outcomes reliably measured. At the same time, the evidence cautions that even these well-intentioned processes require careful management to ensure that challenges like gaming do not offset the potential benefits. The detailed examples provided (from both Kenya and Uganda) thus collectively demonstrate how systematic pre-intervention data collection and responsive operational adjustments are pivotal processes that enable charities to achieve cost effectiveness.
