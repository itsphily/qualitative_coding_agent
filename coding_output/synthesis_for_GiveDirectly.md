# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
The coding data for GiveDirectly reveals a multi-layered strategy of continuous, context‐sensitive refinement of operational processes—all aimed at enhancing cost effectiveness. The evidence shows that GiveDirectly is not simply implementing a “one-size-fits-all” approach; rather, it is actively recalibrating its internal procedures, monitoring systems, beneficiary targeting methods, and cash distribution models based on local challenges, infrastructural realities, and regulatory environments. Each of these operational adjustments speaks directly to the research question—“What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”—by demonstrating how specific process modifications help reduce waste, limit fraud, and ensure that resources are deployed efficiently.

One prominent theme is the structural reorganization designed to mitigate risks and enhance oversight. For example, the charity is “separating jobs that were previously done by one person” (Quote 1) by moving the complaint hotline and followup calls to Kampala, thereby ensuring that call center staff operate independently from field staff based in Mbale. This kind of separation minimizes the chance of collusion or internal fraud, which can otherwise lead to significant hidden costs. Further reinforcing this point, GiveDirectly has also relocated its call center to Kampala (Quote 7), emphasizing that geographic and role-based segregation is seen as a vital control mechanism that supports cost-effective operations.

The data also highlight the expansion and intensification of monitoring and audit processes. In Uganda, for instance, the organization has increased payday audits from about 25% to 100% (Quote 1) and is conducting “real-time phone spot-checks” during paydays to ensure that recipients receive the correct amounts. These steps, while potentially adding an additional layer of operational work, are designed to maintain integrity within the system by reducing fraud and errors. In turn, these enhanced oversight mechanisms cut down on cost leakages in the long run.

Another critical process adjustment is the tailoring of cash transfer distribution models. Recognizing local challenges, GiveDirectly is transitioning from centralized “payday” models to a “distributed cashout” system in Uganda by partnering with MTN Mobile Money (Quote 1 and Quote 5). Initially, the charity abandoned the distributed approach in Uganda due to issues like limited cell phone penetration, but it is now revisiting that model—this time with improved communication to inform recipients of agent locations. By aligning cashout methods with the available mobile payment infrastructure, GiveDirectly reduces logistical inefficiencies and the costs associated with forced centralized distribution.

Complementing these efforts are changes in beneficiary targeting and cash allocation approaches. In certain regions such as Homa Bay County, the organization acknowledges that traditional indicators of poverty (e.g., “thatched roofs”) are not applicable (Quote 4), prompting GiveDirectly to explore other proxy means tests that better capture the local context. In Kenya, the charity has incorporated feedback from focus groups into new targeting criteria, such as paying special attention to widows (Quote 11). Additionally, the board’s decision to raise the transfer amounts in Kenya by about 30% and to index future transfers for inflation (Quote 3) ensures that aid maintains its real value despite changing economic conditions. These practices serve a dual purpose: they ensure that assistance is both appropriate and effective, while also optimizing the allocation of resources according to local cost realities.

Moreover, the evidence identifies further operational streamlining measures that are explicitly aimed at reducing costs. For instance, testing a “higher throughput, lower-cost program” where the frequency of direct interactions with GiveDirectly is reduced—including potentially eliminating a backcheck step—illustrates a willingness to simplify processes while accepting a minor increase in risk for significant cost savings (Quote 10). Similarly, by adopting a “Thatch Plus” targeting model that refines selection criteria and streamlines cash-out days (Quote 6), the charity is not only making its internal procedures more efficient but also ensuring that every resource is used as effectively as possible.

Geographical and regulatory adaptations also figure prominently in the data. As GiveDirectly faces regulatory uncertainties in Uganda, the organization is diversifying its geographic footprint by reallocating some retail donor funds to Rwanda (Quote 12) where registration and hiring processes have been expedited (Quote 13). At the same time, a strategic decision has been made not to expand to additional countries than those in which the charity already operates (Quote 14). This focus on deepening operations in known contexts instead of spreading resources too thinly across new environments minimizes start-up costs and leverages existing infrastructure, reinforcing overall cost efficiency.

Each of these adjustments—from revised internal structuring and rigorous auditing to adaptive cash distribution models and localized targeting criteria—directly connects back to the research question. The evidence suggests that cost effectiveness in charitable operations is not achieved merely by cutting expenses, but by an ongoing process of calibration and optimization. By tailoring procedures to specific environmental, technological, and socio-political contexts, GiveDirectly is actively reducing risks (such as fraud or misallocation), improving transparency, and ultimately ensuring that operational funds are utilized in a manner that maximizes both impact and efficiency.

In conclusion, the operational processes that enable GiveDirectly to be cost effective include:
• The restructuring of roles and geographic division of responsibilities to enhance oversight (e.g., moving the call center and separating functions, as seen in Quotes 1 and 7).
• The scaling up of audits and real-time checks to minimize fraud and ensure process fidelity (Quote 1).
• The adaptation of cash distribution methods, such as the shift from a centralized “payday” model to a distributed cashout system that leverages partnerships like MTN Mobile Money (Quotes 1 and 5).
• The recalibration of beneficiary targeting based on localized needs (as evidenced by the “Thatch Plus” model and new criteria in Kenya, Quotes 4 and 11).
• The strategic adjustment of transfer amounts in response to local economic conditions (Quote 3).
• The streamlining of program interactions to reduce overhead (Quote 10).
• And the responsiveness to regulatory and infrastructure challenges through geographic diversification and a focus on existing operational areas (Quotes 12, 13, and 14).

Each of these process adjustments, drawn exclusively from the provided evidence, underscores a clear link to the research question: by recalibrating their operations to local conditions and continuously refining procedures, GiveDirectly maximizes the effectiveness of each dollar spent, thereby achieving a highly cost-effective model of charitable intervention.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
The evidence provided offers a clear window into how GiveDirectly’s operational processes are deliberately designed and adjusted to enhance cost-effectiveness by integrating research and pre-intervention data collection into decision-making. The three quote/reasoning pairs reveal a consistent pattern: by collecting and acting on early data—whether through baseline surveys or focus groups—GiveDirectly is able to tailor its operational timeline and targeting criteria to improve the allocation of resources, even if that entails making difficult or unconventional choices.

A clear insight emerges from the first quote, where GiveDirectly “intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya” to allow researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study. This deliberate slowing of enrollment illustrates an operational process that prioritizes evidence gathering before full intervention rollout. The quote’s reasoning emphasizes that by pausing to collect critical baseline data, GiveDirectly positions itself to better understand the context and needs of the charity’s target population. In terms of cost-effectiveness, this process means that early insights are obtained which can prevent costly misdirection of resources and promote more effective long-term intervention design. Rather than rushing to enroll beneficiaries, the organization invests in pre-intervention research that has the potential to refine and optimize resource distribution.

A second operational nuance is illustrated in the experience detailed in the Siaya region. Here, the evidence shows that when GiveDirectly “moved more quickly than anticipated,” it faced the challenge of preserving the integrity of their research design. In this instance, token transfers had to be delayed so that the baseline survey could be completed without compromising the randomization of the study. The accompanying reasoning underscores that while making recipients wait was a difficult decision, it was necessary to maintain the methodological integrity of the study—a process that, while operationally challenging, directly supports cost-effectiveness. This trade-off highlights a recurring theme: sometimes operational agility requires making design sacrifices (such as delaying transfers) to ensure that the data collected remains valid and informative. That, in turn, prevents future resource misallocations and enhances overall program efficacy.

The third quote deepens this picture by showing that GiveDirectly’s operational process also involves adapting targeting criteria based on pre-intervention input. In Kenya, new targeting criteria were implemented, informed by focus group feedback that emphasized the particular vulnerability of widows. This change, based on early qualitative data, exemplifies how GiveDirectly listens to community insights and adjusts its enrollment strategy accordingly. Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, the reasoning draws a clear connection: by tailoring enrollment processes using early feedback, the organization is better able to deploy resources where they are most needed, avoiding potential inefficiencies and enhancing operational efficiency.

Collectively, these pieces of evidence indicate a coherent operational strategy: GiveDirectly uses pre-intervention data—a combination of quantitative baseline surveys and qualitative focus group feedback—to shape its enrollment and intervention timelines. This strategy demonstrates operational flexibility, where processes are adjusted dynamically in response to emerging evidence. Specifically, the organization’s willingness to slow enrollment, delay token transfers, and revise targeting criteria are all indicative of a broader commitment to ensuring that the decision-making process is data-driven.

Relating these insights directly to the research question—“What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?”—the evidence tells a compelling story. In each instance, GiveDirectly’s operational processes are geared toward safeguarding the integrity of their interventions. By integrating pre-intervention research into the operational timeline, they create a feedback loop that enables well-informed decision-making at the outset of the program. This, in turn, ensures that resources are allocated based on reliable baseline data and community input, minimizing the risk of misallocation and enhancing cost efficiency. The careful decision to delay recipient transfers in Siaya, for example, underscores that even if the adjustments are challenging, they are critical to avoiding the pitfalls of premature or biased implementation—all of which would have negative cost implications long term.

In conclusion, the evidence clearly illustrates that GiveDirectly’s cost-effective operations hinge on three interlocking processes: (1) prioritizing early data collection through deliberately modified enrollment practices, (2) making difficult but necessary operational trade-offs (such as delaying transfers to ensure valid research outcomes), and (3) adapting targeting criteria based on beneficiary feedback obtained via focus groups. These processes not only optimize the deployment of resources but also reinforce the charity’s overall strategy to maximize long-term impact and cost-effectiveness. Every decision—from slowing enrollment to revising how beneficiaries are identified—demonstrates a calculated effort to ensure that charitable interventions are guided by robust, actionable evidence, thereby directly addressing the research question regarding operational processes that enable cost-effective charitable work.
