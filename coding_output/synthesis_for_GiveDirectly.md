# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Operational Adjustments" for Charity: GiveDirectly

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Geographic separation and decentralized roles to mitigate fraud risk and improve oversight.
- Selection and adaptation of local payment providers to align with existing infrastructure.
- Regular adjustment of transfer amounts and targeting criteria to reflect local economic conditions.
- Flexible distribution mechanisms in areas with limited mobile-payment infrastructure.
- Strategic resource allocation and focus that respond to local regulatory and operational environments.

### Summary:
The evidence from GiveDirectly illustrates a multifaceted approach to operational efficiency that contributes directly to cost effectiveness. By purposely separating functions—such as relocating call centers away from field staff and reallocating leadership responsibilities across regions—the organization minimizes risks like fraud while enhancing oversight. In parallel, GiveDirectly adapts its financial systems by opting for mobile money providers with broader networks and implementing alternative cash-out strategies in areas with poor infrastructure. Moreover, the charity dynamically adjusts its intervention criteria and cash transfer amounts (including indexing for inflation) based on local economic conditions and community feedback. These location-specific operational adjustments, along with strategic decisions to concentrate efforts where processes are already efficient and to respond proactively to shifting regulatory landscapes, demonstrate how tailoring operational processes to local contexts can ultimately enable a charity to achieve greater cost effectiveness.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Pre-Intervention Data Collection & Process Adaptation" for Charity: GiveDirectly

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Deliberate incorporation of pre-intervention data collection into operational timelines.
- Structured, phase-oriented processes (e.g., separate SFO-led phases such as census, enrollment, and verification).
- Flexibility in operational scheduling to balance research integrity with timely beneficiary support.
- Integration of community feedback to refine targeting criteria.

### Summary:
The evidence from GiveDirectly highlights that pre-intervention data collection is a cornerstone of its operational strategy. The charity deliberately adjusts its rollout—for example, by slowing enrollment or delaying token transfers—to create space for essential baseline surveys and focus group feedback. This structured, phase-oriented approach (managed by separate Special Field Officers across different stages) ensures that interventions are implemented with both research rigor and operational efficiency. By balancing the need for accurate data (ensuring proper randomization and validated targeting) with the urgency of delivering assistance, GiveDirectly’s operational planning underscores how integrating pre-intervention insights contributes to overall cost effectiveness. These processes not only maintain the integrity of research studies but also help direct resources to the most vulnerable groups, addressing the research question on the operational processes that enable charities to be cost effective.
