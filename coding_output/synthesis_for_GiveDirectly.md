# Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Operational Processes" for Charity: GiveDirectly

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Separation of roles and centralized oversight to minimize fraud and inefficiency.
- Adaptation of transfer methods and targeting criteria based on local infrastructural and economic conditions.
- Dynamic budgeting and process adjustments (e.g., inflation indexing, efficiency target setting) tailored to regional cost profiles.
- Streamlining administrative procedures to lower costs, including testing simplified verification steps.
- Strategic leveraging of local community resources and existing networks to bypass the need for expensive infrastructure investment.

### Summary:
The evidence shows that GiveDirectly employs a variety of adaptive operational processes to enhance cost effectiveness. In Uganda, for example, the charity has separated duties—relocating call center functions away from field staff—to reduce fraud risks, while in Kenya it adapts targeting criteria with community input and adjusts cash transfers to account for inflation. Similarly, changing mobile money providers to one with a wider agent network or engaging community members as informal agents helps overcome local infrastructural constraints and reduce transaction bottlenecks. By customizing budgeting procedures and efficiency targets based on localized cost structures, as well as testing process simplifications such as removing certain verification steps, GiveDirectly ensures that its interventions are both contextually appropriate and financially sustainable. Collectively, these strategies demonstrate that tailoring operational processes to local environmental, economic, and infrastructural realities is key to achieving cost-effectiveness in charitable operations.

# Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
# Aggregated Summary for Code: "Pre-Intervention Data Collection" for Charity: GiveDirectly

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Key Themes:
- Strategic delays and timeline adjustments to incorporate essential baseline surveys.
- Use of pre-intervention data to safeguard research validity and inform decision-making.
- Engagement of external informants and community feedback to refine eligibility and targeting criteria.
- Alignment of data collection with operational processes to prevent misallocation of resources.

### Summary:
The evidence highlights that GiveDirectly deliberately adjusts its intervention timelines to integrate crucial pre-intervention data collection processes. By pausing enrollment or delaying transfers to complete baseline surveys, the charity ensures the integrity of its randomization and study design—steps that are indirectly linked to cost effectiveness by preventing inefficient resource allocation. In addition, the use of external informants to flag ineligible households and the incorporation of feedback from focus groups to refine targeting criteria further support a strategic approach. These practices demonstrate that a data-informed, flexible operational process is key to optimizing resource use, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.
