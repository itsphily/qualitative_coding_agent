# Aggregated Summary for Charity: Malaria Consortium

## Research Question: What operational processes enable charities to be cost effective?

### Overall Key Themes Across Codes:
- Integration of rigorous pre-intervention data collection with continuous operational research.
- Strong emphasis on forming local partnerships and building capacity with governments, community-based organizations, and local actors.
- Customized, context-driven adaptations including strategic geographic targeting and localized training/communication.
- Data-driven decision making to prioritize needs, optimize resource allocation, and refine interventions iteratively.

### Comprehensive Summary:
Malaria Consortium’s operational approach combines meticulous pre-intervention data collection with adaptive, locally tailored strategies to maximize cost effectiveness. The charity conducts systematic baseline assessments to gather crucial evidence on malaria burden, transmission patterns, and local challenges, ensuring that resource allocation is prioritized based on clear need. This proactive data collection is seamlessly integrated with robust local partnerships that enable capacity building and the tailoring of interventions to specific epidemiological, cultural, and geographic contexts. By leveraging local expertise and continuously adapting strategies—through piloting, iterative modifications, and targeted geographic efforts—Malaria Consortium successfully minimizes wastage and duplication. Together, these processes not only streamline implementation but also ensure that every intervention is cost efficient, directly addressing the research question of which operational processes enable charities to be cost effective.
