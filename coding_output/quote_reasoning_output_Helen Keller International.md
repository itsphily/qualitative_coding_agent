## Code: Calibrating the approach: Changing the charity's intervention depending on the specifics of the location.
### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 5.md
- **Quote:** Identify VAS & de-worming service delivery posts and target population for each post.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates the process of calibrating interventions to a locality by pinpointing where services should be delivered and to whom. Tailoring the intervention based on local target populations can lead to more efficient use of resources and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Identify hard to reach VAS & de-worming service delivery posts and put in place a proper mechanism for reaching these areas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a location-specific operational process. By recognizing and planning for hard-to-reach areas, the charity adapts its intervention to the unique challenges of each location, which can enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production programs empower women from poor households in Africa and Asia with the education and resources needed to raise their own nutritious foods. We work with local farmers and through community organizations to establish Village Model Farms and Farmer Field Schools where women receive hands-on training in gardening and farming practices.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the charity’s operational process of engaging local farmers and community organizations to tailor interventions, likely enhancing sustainability and reducing costs over time.

- **Quote:** By working with respected members of the community and established local organizations, we ensure that the knowledge stays within local communities for years to come.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores an operational process that embeds local capacity, promoting sustainable systems that can indirectly contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In African countries, we also promote growing and eating orange sweet potatoes, a vitamin A-rich superfood. 44% of pre-schoolers in Sub-Saharan Africa are vitamin A deficient, leaving them at much greater risk of dying before their fifth birthday. Orange sweet potatoes are easy to grow and one small portion daily has enough vitamin A for a child to grow healthy and strong.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates a calibration of the intervention to address a specific local nutritional deficiency, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness through targeted, low-cost solutions.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 1.md
- **Quote:** Using data from formative research, determine what type of IEC materials should be used and to whom materials should be targeted.
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that intervention design is informed by local data, which helps tailor resources effectively and can enhance cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** Modify the 6107 baseline survey to include country specific factors and messaging.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational process where survey instruments are adapted to local conditions, improving the relevance of data and potentially contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Determine how often supportive supervision will be implemented in each participating health facility. This will depend on the number of facilities, number of supervisors available, time needed to travel to each facility and budget.
- **Reasoning:** This quote points out that the frequency and method of supportive supervision are tailored based on local logistical factors and budget, reflecting a calibration process that contributes to cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 2.md
- **Quote:** HKI approaches ensuring equity and focus on Hard To Reach populations often contributed to reach the 95% coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the calibration of intervention strategies by focusing on underserved populations, implying that tailored approaches can lead to more efficient resource use and improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** To achieve such results, HKI supported national and sub-national governments in designing and implementing the most cost effective delivery models for their contexts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly ties the calibration of interventions to cost effectiveness, showing that tailoring delivery models to local conditions reduces costs.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 3.md
- **Quote:** 5.1. Are outreach activities planned based on the faraway places/hard to reach areas?
- **Reasoning:** This checklist question reflects an operational process that considers geographic specifics in planning outreach, which is essential for cost-effective resource allocation.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Website 2.md
- **Quote:** According to Esther, who oversees Vitamin A supplementation in six counties in Western Kenya, "in most homesteads the caregivers do not know that after their children reach 9 months after their immunization, the children also need to continue their Vitamin A supplementation."
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a location-specific challenge—caregiver unawareness—that necessitates tailored interventions, which can improve cost effectiveness by addressing local barriers.

- **Quote:** In addition to spreading awareness of the critical importance of Vitamin A, Esther oversees mass supplementation campaigns, some of which traverse many kilometers to bring doses to children who are unable to make the commute.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adaptation to geographic challenges by modifying campaign strategies to reach remote areas, contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Through Helen Keller's work, vitamin A coverage - which normally hovers around 20% - expands exponentially to 80%.
- **Reasoning:** This outcome suggests that calibrated operational processes can dramatically boost coverage, indirectly reflecting improved cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-23 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** If funding is available for a polio immunization campaign in Cote d'Ivoire in October 2018, the funding gap for VAS and deworming for preschool-aged children would be relatively small (around $150,000), since many costs would be shared between the polio immunization, VAS, and deworming programs. If a polio immunization campaign does not occur, the funding gap for VAS and deworming programs would be larger (around $500,000).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where integrating multiple interventions into a single campaign reduces marginal costs, thereby increasing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** VAS and deworming are significantly less costly interventions to implement when delivered through the infrastructure of a polio immunization campaign. For example, transportation of VAS and deworming supplies can be included under costs for polio immunization. Costs specific to the VAS and deworming components of the 2018 campaign in Mali include:

* One additional staff member per distribution team for the proper administration of vitamin A capsules and albendazole tablets (deworming medication)
* Campaign oversight by nutrition officials from Mali's Ministry of Public Health and Hygiene
* Training for additional staff members needed to work on VAS and deworming components of the campaign
* Reporting, printing, and other infrastructural costs related to VAS and deworming
- **Reasoning:** This extensive description highlights how leveraging existing campaign infrastructure can lower implementation costs, illustrating the role of calibration in enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HKI's goal for its technical assistance work in Nigeria and Kenya is to raise VAS coverage rates to 80%. In its past work in Nigeria, it operated in a large number of states, which limited its capacity to achieve higher coverage rates. HKI believes that its future technical assistance work on VAS campaigns would be more effective at increasing coverage rates if it focused on a smaller number of states.
- **Reasoning:** By narrowing its geographic focus, HKI aims to improve intervention effectiveness and efficiency, which contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Various regions of Kenya are highly developed, with a predominantly middle-income population. However, other areas of Kenya are significantly poorer, with low VAS coverage rates and high malnutrition rates.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides contextual evidence of regional disparities, underscoring the need for calibrating interventions to address local differences, which is key for cost effective resource allocation.

- **Quote:** However, funding has not been available in either country for surveys that evaluate VAS coverage. In the absence of VAS coverage surveys, a common assumption is that routine VAS delivery is achieving high coverage rates. However, routine VAS in Mozambique and Sierra Leone may not be reaching children older than one year. HKI believes that it could assist these countries and others transitioning to routine VAS delivery to increase coverage rates by conducting miniature campaigns that deliver vitamin A supplements to children that were not reached through routine delivery.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how operational adjustments, such as conducting miniature campaigns in response to local delivery gaps, are used to calibrate interventions, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2020-09-15 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** How the newborn vitamin A dose is packaged and delivered can affect the cost of the intervention. If the vitamin A is administered at the time of birth to women giving birth in a health facility, or by a health worker during a postpartum visit, newborn vitamin A doses can be packaged in inexpensive plastic bottles. If, however, the vitamin A supplements are pre-delivered to a home of an expectant mother or given to a woman at an antenatal visit (for her to store until the birth of her baby), appropriate packaging will be required for each capsule, and this may be costly, adding to the overall cost of the intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the choice of packaging and delivery method—tailored based on whether birth occurs in a facility or at home—directly impacts costs, highlighting a calibration process to local service delivery conditions.

- **Quote:** Mortality among newborns is highest in the first week of life. To maximize benefit from NVAS, newborns must be dosed within a few days of birth, which can be challenging in settings where most women give birth at home. Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period. The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how testing different delivery methods in home-birth settings constitutes an operational adjustment that can enhance cost-effectiveness by optimizing resource use without additional staffing.

- **Quote:** Once a setting has been chosen, one possible initial approach might be to focus on facility deliveries only, which would make administration easier. In many countries, facility deliveries are becoming more common; in Nepal, for example, more than half of children are born in an attended facility. In short, some work would need to be done to ensure operational feasibility, possibly including operational pilot programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the idea of calibrating the intervention to local conditions—by focusing on facility deliveries where feasible—to streamline operations and reduce costs.

### Doc Name: 2017-06-01 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Universal supplementation may not be the best approach in countries with lower deficiency and mortality rates (e.g., Kenya). It might be more effective to focus on the most vulnerable geographic regions (e.g., northern Cameroon still has a high rate of VAD while rates in the south are substantially lower).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that involves calibrating interventions by focusing on regions with the highest need, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It is also important to look at differences across regions of a country (e.g., rural vs. urban, north vs. south, etc.), and to clarify assumptions about given regions with countries before recommending strategy changes, recognizing that particular strategies may or may not be appropriate in different regions.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the need to consider geographic and contextual variations in planning interventions, which is fundamental to resource allocation and cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021-01-26 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Budgets for VAS campaigns may also vary considerably depending on the platform used and the geographical coverage. Integrating VAS into the April National Immunization Day, covering all 10 regions, is expected to cost $150,000, while a dedicated VAS campaign in only four regions could cost $500,000. Not knowing what platform may be available for the campaign makes it difficult to estimate funding needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how choosing different operational platforms based on geographical coverage affects costs, which is key to calibrating interventions for cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, for several reasons this goal may not be achievable, in which case UNICEF prioritizes four of the 10 regions: North, Far North, East, and Adamawa. These regions are UNICEF's primary targets based on their high rates of vitamin A deficiency and child mortality.
- **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence that operational strategies are calibrated by targeting specific regions based on local needs, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

- **Quote:** Stand-alone VAS campaigns are generally too costly to be feasibly implemented by UNICEF alone. A stand-alone campaign was implemented in the Far North and North regions only in December 2020, at a cost of $300,000, but this was an exception and would not be possible to do every year.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the cost implications of different operational approaches and reinforces the importance of calibrating interventions to leverage cost efficiencies.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-09 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Plan A 
– Ideally, VAS will occur along with a polio immunization campaign, so that some of the costs of the distribution are covered. Plan B 
– If there is no polio campaign, HKI will run an independent campaign that includes VAS, deworming, malnutrition screening, and vaccination catch-up. The lack of a polio immunization campaign is likely to increase costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how HKI designs different operational plans based on local circumstances, with integrated campaigns offering more cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** For rural populations, HKI plans to do two-phase sampling. HKI will randomly select some number of districts, and then randomly select some number of villages within those districts. With this system, less travel time will be necessary to collect data than it would be if the villages were randomly selected throughout the entire country.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment in data collection that reduces travel time and costs, showing how calibration to rural contexts can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HKI usually dispatches nationally trained teams to conduct the campaigns. However, given the security situation in some parts of Mali, it is important to only send people who have in-depth knowledge of the region, so instead of a central team they are having local teams from each village collect data in their own areas. This approach has required more preparation than usual on HKI's part.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how HKI adapts its operational processes by using local teams in regions with security concerns, a calibration that can help mitigate risks and control costs.

- **Quote:** HKI plans to conduct national post-event coverage surveys (PECS) using cross-sectional methodology with city clusters. It plans to sample urban and rural areas differently because they usually have quite different coverage, so at the end of the survey there will be three coverage measures: representative coverage for rural areas, representative coverage for urban areas, and national representative coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process where data collection methods are adjusted based on geographic differences, enabling more cost-effective evaluations and interventions.

### Doc Name: 2018-02-09 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** HKI's CMM program focuses less on providing treatment and more on conducting screenings and referring children to treatment. However, in some countries, HKI also provides lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) to children aged 6 to 23 months and follows them for 18 to 24 months to analyze long-term outcomes such as growth.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where interventions are tailored to local needs, with different approaches in different countries, which may contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** If HKI received additional funding, it would fund community-based nutrition programs in West Africa designed to prevent children from developing serious nutrition issues. This type of program would hold community screenings to identify children that may benefit from treatment. The treatment would likely take a behavior change approach and include the provision of LNS.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a planned operational process that is geographically targeted and tailored to local needs, which can improve cost effectiveness by directing resources where they are most needed.

- **Quote:** Nutrition programs often suffer from significant attrition, which may be caused by long distances to clinics and a variety of other factors. HKI would be interested in using additional funding to improve its effectiveness by testing various community-based models for treating severe acute malnutrition.
- **Reasoning:** This passage points to operational challenges related to distance and attrition, and describes an interest in testing community-based models as a calibration method to improve cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** One of the major challenges of implementing CMAM is determining the proper balance between external support and local control. Currently, there is a lack of evidence establishing what structure will be most conducive to program success and cost-effectiveness. This is an important problem to solve, because programs that bypass local health systems tend not to be cost-effective and struggle with sustainability. Involvement of local health systems is not sufficient on its own; the quality and manner in which the health system is integrated also affect sustainability in the long term. One possible strategy is to develop a hybrid program, where responsibility for implementing the program is shared between non-government organizations (NGOs), government agencies, local health systems, and community members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote discusses the need to balance external support and local control, an operational calibration that is key to achieving cost-effective and sustainable programs.

- **Quote:** HKI's approach has been to integrate a preventive component into these programs, as well as to work with existing health systems, especially at the community level, to bring screening and treatment closer to affected communities.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines a tailored operational strategy that leverages local health systems, which can help reduce costs and improve intervention effectiveness.

- **Quote:** If HKI received funding for CMAM interventions, it would likely use them to expand work in areas that are currently underserved by large NGOs (which is the vast majority of Africa).
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows location-based calibration, targeting underserved areas to maximize impact and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Mass administration of amoxicillin with CMAM appears to work well in areas where other health interventions are not being implemented, but it's possible that such an intervention would not be necessary and would lose its effectiveness if local health systems were adequately providing basic treatment to children to begin with, as outlined above.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of certain interventions depends on local health system capacity, emphasizing the need for calibration to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Response to GiveWell Assessment.md
- **Quote:** We provided GiveWell with evidence from two countries (Cameroon and Kenya) which demonstrated that HKI's technical assistance contributed to significantly higher coverage rates. We appreciate GiveWell's desire to understand HKI's added value by assessing VAS program performance using a counterfactual paradigm. Unfortunately, due to the lack of funding in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire in 2017, HKI has been unable to provide VAS technical support to either country providing counterfactual examples. Sadly, both countries missed a VAS distribution round in the first semester of 2017 suggesting that in the absence of HKI's support the VAS programs in both countries were negatively affected. During their planned country visit, we encourage GiveWell to look further into the added value HKI provides to VAS coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how providing technical assistance that is tailored to country-specific contexts can influence program outcomes and cost-effectiveness, by contrasting scenarios with and without such support.

- **Quote:** We feel it is important to note that VAS often serves as the driver behind Child Health Days (CHDs) and Child Health Weeks onto which other vital health and nutrition services (such as deworming, measles immunization, distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, screening for acute malnutrition, and others) are piggy-backed. For example, CHDs delivered nearly half of all global deworming treatments to preschool children in 2013, thus illustrating the strategic importance of this delivery mechanism for attaining high coverage of vital services targeting preschool-age children (Kumapley et al 2015). The design of CHDs and the package of interventions offered can be tailored to the local contexts; and in fragile health systems, CHDs serve as a major delivery platform for high-impact interventions targeted to preschool age children. Because the semi-annual delivery of VAS to preschool children is often the main driver behind CHDs, we feel it is important for cost per supplement delivered and cost-effectiveness models to consider these added benefits.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how tailoring the design of mass campaign platforms like CHDs to local conditions can enhance coverage and reduce per-unit costs, thereby supporting cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** Increasing coverage rates: Helen Keller identifies districts or regions participating in mass campaigns that have low VAS coverage rates and provides sub-national governments in those regions with technical support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where monitoring local performance leads to targeted technical support, contributing to more efficient and cost-effective campaign outcomes.

- **Quote:** Helen Keller has developed standard questionnaires, which in 2019 were adapted for use in each country and translated into local languages.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how operational tools are customized to local contexts, allowing for more accurate data collection and potentially more cost-effective resource allocation.

- **Quote:** Helen Keller-supported VAS programs distribute vitamin A supplements through either mass distribution campaigns or through routine delivery (in which caregivers take their children to facilities to receive VAS every six months). Helen Keller supports two types of VAS mass distribution campaigns: Door-to-door campaigns in which community health workers travel to recipients' homes to distribute and administer vitamin A supplements and other interventions to preschool-aged children. Fixed-site campaigns in which caregivers bring preschool-aged children to health facilities or outreach posts to receive vitamin A supplements and other interventions. Fixed-site campaigns use social mobilization activities (e.g., fliers and radio announcements) to remind caregivers to bring their preschool-aged children to nearby distribution sites during the campaign dates.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines how different delivery methods are employed based on local conditions, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate distribution strategy to enhance cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** By delivering VAS through preexisting government infrastructure, DEVTA tested not only the efficacy of VAS, but also the practicability of implementing large-scale VAS at low cost.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links the use of existing government infrastructure to lower implementation costs, demonstrating an operational process that leverages local systems to achieve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** It is also possible that DEVTA's results were significantly affected by the exclusion of areas without functioning AWCs. VAS might have had greater efficacy in areas without functioning AWCs, which we suspect are more remote (and therefore may have more severe or prevalent VAD and worse overall health) than the areas covered by DEVTA. However, it may also be more costly to implement VAS in these areas, so it is not clear what the net impact on cost-effectiveness would be of extending the program to other areas.
- **Reasoning:** This passage discusses how differences in local infrastructure can affect both the efficacy and cost of interventions, highlighting the importance of calibrating approaches based on local context.

- **Quote:** If VAS is only successful in areas with extremely high VAD, extremely high prevalence of diarrhea and measles, or low access to life-saving treatment for these diseases, only charities that could show that they have narrowly targeted such a population would be likely to convince us that their intervention would have higher effects on child mortality than DEVTA.
- **Reasoning:** This statement supports the argument that targeting interventions to specific local health challenges is necessary to achieve higher impact and cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-10-9 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Microplanning of VAS programs is critical, because campaigns may disrupt normal healthcare services if they are not done correctly. Therefore, planning and sensitization workshops are very important for the success of VAS campaigns. HKI currently runs workshops in which it teaches VAS program leaders how to organize teams and plan outreach strategies, among other things. If HKI had additional funding, it would organize district-based workshops with comprehensive, practical planning. It would do this by bringing districts together at a central point for two workshops in one week, and then would sponsor the districts to run similar workshops with facility nurses. It would also send supervisors into the field with health workers, so that the supervisors could address issues as they arose. It is also important to plan appropriate VAS programs for different types of communities. In urban areas, it may be difficult for many caregivers who work long hours (e.g., shopkeepers) to bring their children to a fixed point to receive VAS. In these types of communities, a door-to-door distribution approach may be more appropriate. In rural areas, where caregivers are usually engaged in agricultural work, it is easier to set up a fixed point distribution at a time when caregivers would be able to bring their children, since agricultural workers are generally following a common, regular schedule.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines how microplanning and tailored workshops are used to calibrate VAS program delivery to local contexts, which is essential for maintaining cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Most of Mali is desert and much of the population is pastoral, so the population is too scattered for a fixed strategy to work. In addition, the country is very heterogeneous, so an effective VAS delivery strategy should use different methodologies for different areas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that in diverse settings like Mali, operational strategies must be adapted to local geographic and demographic challenges, which is critical for cost-effectiveness.

## Code: Pre-intervention data collection: Collecting information about the charitable cause before implementing the charity's intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 4.md
- **Quote:** Step 2: Obtaining relevant information from the care giver
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that before any intervention is administered, there is a designated step to collect key information from the caregiver. This pre-intervention data collection is important because it informs subsequent operational decisions (such as determining which supplement to administer) and helps structure the intervention process in a way that may enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Ask the age of the child to determine the appropriate dose of vitamin A (6-59 months) and whether the child is old enough for a deworming tablet (12-59 months).
- **Reasoning:** This detailed instruction exemplifies how collecting specific pre-intervention information (the age of the child) directly guides operational processes—ensuring that the correct intervention (appropriate dose or eligibility for the deworming tablet) is carried out. By tailoring the intervention based on the information collected, the process supports efficient resource use, which is a key component of cost effective operations.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 5.md
- **Quote:** This document does not replace the more detailed VASD Implementation Guide, which serves as the main reference and full guide to implementing VASD. The document makes assumptions to best-case scenarios and is based on feedback from district officials and facilitators integrally involved in previous VASD events.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that pre-intervention feedback and collected information from district officials and facilitators were used to form the basis for the toolkit. It demonstrates how gathering insights beforehand shapes the operational tools and planning for VASD events, which is relevant to understanding how information collection can lead to cost-effective implementation.

- **Quote:** TFNC in collaboration with HKI have designed the SBCC strategy with the aim of increasing VASD coverage in Tanzanian children 6 to 59 months, based on the findings from three sources: Post Event Coverage Survey, nationwide, July 2011; to determine VASD coverage and determinants of VASD. Situational Assessment, in all 21 regions of Tanzania, November 2011; to determine the SBCC needs in Tanzania. Barrier Analysis, in Tanga Municipal, May 2012; to determine major determinants of the Muslim population to VASD behaviour as well as additional information needed to conceive a communication strategy.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly details how multiple sources of collected data (including a situational assessment and barrier analysis, which are pre-intervention studies) informed the design of the SBCC strategy. It provides evidence that collecting detailed information prior to interventions plays a crucial role in shaping operational planning and strategies that could enhance cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 1.md
- **Quote:** Using data from formative research, determine what type of IEC materials should be used and to whom materials should be targeted.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that pre-intervention information (formative research data) is collected and used to design targeted IEC materials. It shows how gathering data before an intervention helps shape the operational processes, an idea that is relevant to understanding how information collection can drive cost-effective practices.

- **Quote:** Prior to the introduction of the 6-month contact point activities, a baseline survey must be conducted.
- **Reasoning:** This statement explicitly indicates that data is gathered before implementing the intervention. Conducting a baseline survey is a pre-intervention step that informs the operational processes, potentially leading to a more efficient and cost-effective approach in executing the program.

### Doc Name: 2020-09-15 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** With conclusive evidence of the benefits of newborn vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh, Hopkins researchers began advocating for the Bangladeshi government to pilot the intervention in a real-life program setting before taking the intervention to scale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that once pre-intervention data confirmed the benefits of NVAS, the researchers moved to a pilot phase. This pre-implementation evidence directly informed the design of operational processes (i.e., piloting in a real-world setting) aimed at cost effective intervention delivery.

- **Quote:** Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period.
- **Reasoning:** This passage details a pre-intervention pilot study where operational strategies were tested. By comparing two delivery methods, the team collected critical information to shape the operational process for administering NVAS in a cost effective manner.

- **Quote:** The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores how information gathered during the pilot phase led to an operational decision: leveraging an existing government system to administer doses. This strategy enhances cost effectiveness by avoiding additional staffing costs, directly illustrating the impact of pre-intervention data collection on operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2017-06-01 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** If there is high-quality data showing low VAD in a region, HKI thinks it is reasonable not to expect VAS to have a mortality impact there.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that having reliable, pre-intervention data about vitamin A deficiency in a region informs HKI’s decision on whether to implement the VAS intervention. By identifying areas where the need (and therefore potential impact) is lower, the organization can avoid expending resources where cost-effectiveness would be compromised, thereby shaping operational processes.

- **Quote:** HKI recommends that countries look at trends in the above factors (over, e.g., the last 10 years) rather than just the current situation. For instance, if food fortification coverage has increased significantly and malnutrition has decreased in a given country, this can helpfully inform decision-making even without providing direct information on VAD prevalence.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that collecting long-term trend data—even when direct indicators (like VAD prevalence) are not available—plays a critical role in guiding decision-making. By using such pre-intervention information, charities can adjust operational processes (such as scaling back or reforming interventions) to ensure that resources are allocated cost effectively.

- **Quote:** The GOVA framework will emphasize the importance of collecting more data and include a section with recommendations on how to do this.
- **Reasoning:** This statement underscores that the forthcoming decision-making framework explicitly builds on systematic data collection. Such pre-intervention data gathering is viewed as essential for informing operational strategies, thereby supporting the notion that collecting information before implementing interventions can drive more cost‐effective charity operations.

### Doc Name: 2021-01-26 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Funding needs can remain very uncertain until the last minute. UNICEF did not know how the first campaign of 2021 would be funded as recently as the end of December 2020; two weeks after that, it learned of the opportunity to integrate VAS into the April National Immunization Day and was able to get top-up funds from GAC.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that up-to-date information collected just before an intervention—a form of pre-intervention data gathering—directly influenced the operational decision to integrate VAS into an existing campaign. This decision, made after receiving new funding information, is pivotal in controlling costs and illustrates how collecting timely information shapes cost‐effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** Budgets for VAS campaigns may also vary considerably depending on the platform used and the geographical coverage. Integrating VAS into the April National Immunization Day, covering all 10 regions, is expected to cost $150,000, while a dedicated VAS campaign in only four regions could cost $500,000. Not knowing what platform may be available for the campaign makes it difficult to estimate funding needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores that the choice of intervention platform—determined by information gathered before implementation—directly affects budgeting and cost effectiveness. The uncertainty about available platforms prior to the campaign demonstrates how pre-intervention data collection is vital for shaping operational processes to achieve more cost-effective outcomes.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-09 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** In the coming weeks the Ministry of Health will send HKI two plans, indicating how much a national campaign using each plan would cost, and what funds are available. Roughly, the plans are: Plan A - Ideally, VAS will occur along with a polio immunization campaign, so that some of the costs of the distribution are covered. Plan B - If there is no polio campaign, HKI will run an independent campaign that includes VAS, deworming, malnutrition screening, and vaccination catch-up. The lack of a polio immunization campaign is likely to increase costs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote reflects a pre-intervention information process where HKI relies on detailed plans (and cost projections) provided by the Ministry of Health to decide on its operational strategy. The choice between two campaign plans based on funding and cost data highlights how prior collected information shapes decisions aimed at ensuring cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, given the security situation in some parts of Mali, it is important to only send people who have in-depth knowledge of the region, so instead of a central team they are having local teams from each village collect data in their own areas. This approach has required more preparation than usual on HKI's part.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that pre-existing information about local contexts (in this case, security conditions) informs operational adjustments. The decision to deploy local teams—based on detailed local knowledge—demonstrates how collecting information before interventions can lead to tailored, potentially more cost-effective, operational processes.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Based on the literature and the financials of current programs, HKI estimates the cost of implementing CMAM at approximately $200 per child. HKI believes that a well-run, government-funded version of the program could likely reduce the cost to $100 per child, as many of the associated costs are for staff salaries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that HKI uses information collected from existing literature and financial data (i.e., pre-intervention information) to estimate program costs. The analysis of these data informs considerations for modifying operational processes—such as shifting to a government-funded model—to achieve greater cost-effectiveness, which is directly related to the research question regarding the influence of pre-intervention data collection on operational efficiency.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Response to GiveWell Assessment.md
- **Quote:** While HKI recognizes the urgent need for updated and valid estimates of vitamin A status in the countries and sub-regions where we work, HKI relies on the best available evidence from scientific sources to ensure that its VAS programs are targeting at risk populations.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that HKI uses pre-existing scientific data as a basis for targeting its interventions. By relying on collected and available evidence about vitamin A deficiency, the charity tailors its operational processes to focus on at-risk populations, which is a key factor in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Currently, many countries implementing VAS programs have no VAD data or the data do exist are >10 years old. Clearly, there is an urgent need to fill this data gap and for funders and host-country governments to invest in high-quality surveys to assess VA (and other micronutrient) status and program coverage in children.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the critical role of up-to-date, reliable data collection before interventions. The absence of current data is presented as a gap that can compromise program targeting and, consequently, cost efficiency. It underscores how collecting information is integral to shaping operational decisions that improve the cost effectiveness of the intervention.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** In April 2017, we invited Helen Keller International (Helen Keller) to apply to be considered for a top charity recommendation for its vitamin A supplementation program. To date, our investigation of Helen Keller has consisted of: Conversations with Helen Keller staff. Reviewing documents Helen Keller shared with us. A visit to Conakry, Guinea in October 2017 to meet with representatives of Helen Keller.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows the deliberate pre-intervention data collection process carried out by GiveWell. By gathering information through conversations, document reviews, and site visits before any intervention is implemented, they are able to evaluate the charity’s operational processes and cost-effectiveness potential.

- **Quote:** Helen Keller proposed supporting VAS campaigns in Bauchi State, Nigeria, in 2019, and we asked Helen Keller to implement a baseline coverage survey prior to beginning its work. The coverage survey found a coverage rate of 86%, and Helen Keller learned that another organization, Catholic Relief Services, was already supporting VAS campaigns in the state.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides a concrete example of how pre-intervention information (a baseline coverage survey) was collected. The results influenced operational decisions by revealing an existing intervention in the area, which in turn would shape resource allocation and contribute to the charity’s overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-10-9 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** At this stage, HKI needs to do a formative assessment to identify potential barriers to CHWs' activities, and fine-tune the design.
- **Reasoning:** This quote, taken from the Burkina Faso section, shows that before fully rolling out a new Community Health Worker–based approach, HKI intends to collect formative information. By planning to assess potential barriers ahead of implementation, HKI demonstrates how pre-intervention information gathering is used to adapt operational processes with a view to improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Microplanning of VAS programs is critical, because campaigns may disrupt normal healthcare services if they are not done correctly. Therefore, planning and sensitization workshops are very important for the success of VAS campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** Although this quote does not explicitly describe a formal pre-intervention data collection process, it implies that gathering local contextual information (through planning and sensitization workshops) precedes the intervention. This pre-implementation planning informs how teams are organized and how outreach strategies are designed, thereby shaping operational processes that help achieve cost-effective VAS campaigns.

## Code: Using pilot projects: Using trial projects when the charity enters a new location.
### Doc Name: 2020-09-15 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** With conclusive evidence of the benefits of newborn vitamin A supplementation in Bangladesh, Hopkins researchers began advocating for the Bangladeshi government to pilot the intervention in a real-life program setting before taking the intervention to scale.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an instance where a trial or pilot project was proposed to test operational feasibility in a new setting before full-scale implementation—a process that can reveal cost-effective operational models.

- **Quote:** Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period. The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This passage describes a trial project comparing two delivery methods in a new operational context. It offers insight into how experimenting with different approaches—such as leveraging existing government systems—can optimize processes and potentially drive down costs.

- **Quote:** Once a setting has been chosen, one possible initial approach might be to focus on facility deliveries only, which would make administration easier. In many countries, facility deliveries are becoming more common; in Nepal, for example, more than half of children are born in an attended facility. In short, some work would need to be done to ensure operational feasibility, possibly including operational pilot programs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of pilot projects as a tool for testing and refining operational processes in a new location. By evaluating different methods (such as facility-based delivery), organizations can identify more cost-effective operational strategies before scaling up.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** Helen Keller proposed supporting VAS campaigns in Bauchi State, Nigeria, in 2019, and we asked Helen Keller to implement a baseline coverage survey prior to beginning its work. The coverage survey found a coverage rate of 86%, and Helen Keller learned that another organization, Catholic Relief Services, was already supporting VAS campaigns in the state.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a trial project-like activity when entering a new location—by implementing a baseline survey before full-scale campaign rollout, Helen Keller was able to gain operational insights (e.g., existing coverage levels and duplicate efforts) that inform strategic adjustments aimed at improving cost effectiveness.

## Code: Enhancing capabilities of local stakeholders: Improving the ability of local partners to conduct the intervention.
### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 5.md
- **Quote:** This set of job aids is part of the VASD Toolkit that was developed for district level officials. It not only serves as an introduction to VASD, but it will help you to better plan VASD events as well as provides you with clear tools to facilitate your communication with colleagues, leaders, and other influential people.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the toolkit’s operational processes—through job aids and clear communication tools—are designed to enhance local stakeholders' ability to plan and execute interventions. Improved planning and communication can streamline interventions, potentially reducing resource waste and contributing indirectly to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Planning is needed for any successful outcomes of the program. It helps in deciding on what to do, why to do it and how best it can be done. A comprehensive plan prior to carrying out VASD events will ensure you tackle all necessary steps for success.
- **Reasoning:** This passage underscores the critical role of systematic planning—an operational process—in ensuring that every necessary step is addressed before an intervention. Such thorough preparation equips local stakeholders to conduct interventions more efficiently, which is a vital factor in improving cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Website 4.md
- **Quote:** Helen Keller International's Enhanced Homestead Food Production programs empower women from poor households in Africa and Asia with the education and resources needed to raise their own nutritious foods.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process aimed at improving local stakeholders' capacity through education and resource provision. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, the empowerment of local women is implied to reduce long–term external support costs, thereby potentially contributing to the charity’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We work with local farmers and through community organizations to establish Village Model Farms and Farmer Field Schools where women receive hands-on training in gardening and farming practices. By working with respected members of the community and established local organizations, we ensure that the knowledge stays within local communities for years to come.
- **Reasoning:** This quote describes a concrete operational process that builds local capacity by embedding training and knowledge within communities. The sustained local expertise suggested here implies that repeated external intervention costs might be reduced over time, indirectly supporting the charity's cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 2.md
- **Quote:** To achieve such results, HKI supported national and sub-national governments in designing and implementing the most cost effective delivery models for their contexts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process where a charity enhances local stakeholders' (national and sub-national governments) capacity by involving them in the design and implementation of cost effective delivery models. This approach contributes to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity’s intervention by leveraging local expertise and tailoring strategies to specific contexts.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Website 2.md
- **Quote:** According to Esther, who oversees Vitamin A supplementation in six counties in Western Kenya, 'in most homesteads the caregivers do not know that after their children reach 9 months after their immunization, the children also need to continue their Vitamin A supplementation.'
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a gap in local knowledge regarding continued vitamin A supplementation. It underscores the need for operational processes (such as awareness campaigns) to empower local stakeholders, which, although not directly linked to cost effectiveness in the text, implies that improving stakeholder understanding can enhance the efficiency and impact of interventions.

- **Quote:** In addition to spreading awareness of the critical importance of Vitamin A, Esther oversees mass supplementation campaigns, some of which traverse many kilometers to bring doses to children who are unable to make the commute.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where a local manager actively coordinates outreach efforts. By enabling local stakeholders to deliver services even in remote areas, the program likely reduces service gaps and inefficiencies, a factor that can contribute to greater cost effectiveness through improved resource utilization.

- **Quote:** Through Helen Keller's work, vitamin A coverage - which normally hovers around 20% - expands exponentially to 80%.
- **Reasoning:** This statement provides a quantitative outcome of the campaigns, indicating a dramatic increase in coverage. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, the substantial improvement in reach suggests that operational processes involving local stakeholders may increase efficiency and lower per-beneficiary costs.

- **Quote:** I am particularly moved when I visit a household during the campaign and I can see the mothers, fathers, caregivers, grandparents, siblings, run around to make sure they call all the children who are under 5 years to come and receive the vitamin A supplementation.
- **Reasoning:** This personal account illustrates robust local stakeholder mobilization and community engagement. The active role of various household members reflects how empowering local actors through operational processes can boost intervention success, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness by leveraging community resources rather than relying solely on external delivery mechanisms.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-23 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** VAS and deworming are significantly less costly interventions to implement when delivered through the infrastructure of a polio immunization campaign. For example, transportation of VAS and deworming supplies can be included under costs for polio immunization.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how leveraging existing local operational infrastructure (the polio immunization campaign) reduces additional costs for VAS and deworming. This integration, an operational process that enhances local stakeholders' capacity, contributes to overall cost effectiveness by minimizing redundant expenditures.

- **Quote:** Costs specific to the VAS and deworming components of the 2018 campaign in Mali include: one additional staff member per distribution team for the proper administration of vitamin A capsules and albendazole tablets (deworming medication); campaign oversight by nutrition officials from Mali's Ministry of Public Health and Hygiene; training for additional staff members needed to work on VAS and deworming components of the campaign; reporting, printing, and other infrastructural costs related to VAS and deworming
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of added operational components—such as staffing, training, and local oversight—demonstrates how operational processes are implemented to improve the local stakeholders’ ability to execute interventions efficiently. Enhanced local capacity through such measures can help lower overall costs by integrating these activities with larger existing campaigns.

- **Quote:** HKI's budgets for VAS campaigns in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso in 2018 include grants (or 'sub-agreements') to local and regional governments to support the implementation of the campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** By providing grants directly to local and regional governments, HKI is operationally empowering local stakeholders to manage and implement interventions. This mechanism not only builds local capacity but also leverages local knowledge and resources, which can enhance cost effectiveness for charity operations.

### Doc Name: 2020-09-15 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that leverages existing local government infrastructure, thereby avoiding additional staffing costs. By using the local health system to deliver the intervention, the charity can reduce operating expenses, which contributes directly to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** How the newborn vitamin A dose is packaged and delivered can affect the cost of the intervention. If the vitamin A is administered at the time of birth to women giving birth in a health facility, or by a health worker during a postpartum visit, newborn vitamin A doses can be packaged in inexpensive plastic bottles.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that operational decisions regarding packaging and delivery methods—particularly incorporating local stakeholders like health facility staff or postpartum health workers—can lower the intervention costs. This suggests that improving local stakeholders' operational capacity can enhance the overall cost effectiveness of the program.

### Doc Name: 2017-06-01 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** HKI's flexibility to send teams from one region to another to provide technical assistance and build capacity has been valuable, and HKI has a recognized expertise in this area.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that operational processes, specifically the provision of technical assistance and capacity building by HKI, enhance local stakeholders’ ability to implement interventions. By improving local capacity, the charity helps ensure sustained and efficient program delivery, which is a key aspect of overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Transitioning to routine delivery of VAS can be challenging. When Kenya transitioned from door-to-door to routine delivery without technical assistance, coverage fell from roughly 90% to 20% during one campaign, and it took several years to bring coverage rates back up. HKI hopes to help prevent this in other places, since it is more difficult and requires more resources to bring coverage rates back up than to prevent them from falling.
- **Reasoning:** This passage highlights the cost implications of inadequate operational support. It illustrates that without proper technical assistance, local stakeholders struggle to maintain high intervention coverage, leading to resource-intensive recovery efforts. Thus, improving operational processes to support local implementation can yield significant cost savings and contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021-01-26 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Budgets for VAS campaigns may also vary considerably depending on the platform used and the geographical coverage. Integrating VAS into the April National Immunization Day, covering all 10 regions, is expected to cost $150,000, while a dedicated VAS campaign in only four regions could cost $500,000. Not knowing what platform may be available for the campaign makes it difficult to estimate funding needs.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the cost differences between using an integrated operational process (leveraging existing platforms likely managed by local stakeholders) versus executing a stand-alone campaign. It suggests that when local operational systems are effectively utilized, overall cost effectiveness is improved, which is relevant to understanding how operational processes contribute to charities’ cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** VAS is integrated into routine health service delivery for children aged six to 11 months. Children in this age group may receive VAS during their six-month or nine-month routine health system contacts, or if they visit a clinic for any other reason during this time.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how VAS delivery is embedded within existing routine health service operations. By leveraging established local health systems—an example of an operational process that improves local stakeholders' ability to conduct interventions—it implicitly supports cost effectiveness by utilizing existing, lower-cost structures.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-09 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** However, given the security situation in some parts of Mali, it is important to only send people who have in-depth knowledge of the region, so instead of a central team they are having local teams from each village collect data in their own areas. This approach has required more preparation than usual on HKI's part.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process in which HKI enhances local stakeholders’ ability by engaging local teams to conduct data collection under challenging security conditions. Although the quote does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, using local teams can help maintain campaign quality and continuity in insecure regions, thereby potentially reducing costs associated with disruptions and centralized deployment.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** One of the major challenges of implementing CMAM is determining the proper balance between external support and local control. Currently, there is a lack of evidence establishing what structure will be most conducive to program success and cost-effectiveness. This is an important problem to solve, because programs that bypass local health systems tend not to be cost-effective and struggle with sustainability. Involvement of local health systems is not sufficient on its own; the quality and manner in which the health system is integrated also affect sustainability in the long term. One possible strategy is to develop a hybrid program, where responsibility for implementing the program is shared between non-government organizations (NGOs), government agencies, local health systems, and community members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by highlighting that the integration and strengthening of local health systems—an operational process to improve local stakeholders’ ability to conduct interventions—are crucial to achieving cost-effectiveness. It explicitly contrasts the cost-ineffectiveness of bypassing local systems with the potential benefits of a hybrid program that leverages local control.

- **Quote:** In current CMAM programs, an NGO will typically partner with local health systems to implement the intervention. The NGO sends staff members to health centers on a regular basis, where they provide training and supervision to local health workers, ensuring that preventive counseling and food supplement provision is occurring as intended. After some period of time, the NGO typically withdraws from its direct role in health centers' work, in the hope that health centers will be able to maintain the program independently.
- **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational process focused on capacity building, where NGOs provide training and supervision to local health workers to eventually enable local systems to independently manage the intervention. The gradual transition from external to local management is implied to improve long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness, linking local stakeholder empowerment with overall program cost reduction.

- **Quote:** One important step toward developing an effective CMAM program is setting up a dedicated office within the target country's Ministry of Health or equivalent government agency. This strategy would integrate CMAM into the existing government structure, while maintaining control over the human resource aspects of the program, so that high-quality hires can be made without undue bureaucratic influence.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an operational process that enhances local stakeholders' ability to oversee and implement interventions by embedding them within a government framework. Such integration is poised to reduce reliance on external support and can help lower costs through improved management and sustained local control, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Response to GiveWell Assessment.md
- **Quote:** We provided GiveWell with evidence from two countries (Cameroon and Kenya) which demonstrated that HKI's technical assistance contributed to significantly higher coverage rates. We appreciate GiveWell's desire to understand HKI's added value by assessing VAS program performance using a counterfactual paradigm. Unfortunately, due to the lack of funding in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire in 2017, HKI has been unable to provide VAS technical support to either country providing counterfactual examples. Sadly, both countries missed a VAS distribution round in the first semester of 2017 suggesting that in the absence of HKI's support the VAS programs in both countries were negatively affected. During their planned country visit, we encourage GiveWell to look further into the added value HKI provides to VAS coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that HKI’s technical assistance—an operational process that improves local stakeholders’ ability to implement interventions—directly contributes to higher coverage rates. Enhanced coverage suggests that when local stakeholders are supported, the intervention is more successfully executed, which in turn can improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We feel it is important to note that VAS often serves as the driver behind Child Health Days (CHDs) and Child Health Weeks onto which other vital health and nutrition services (such as deworming, measles immunization, distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, screening for acute malnutrition, and others) are piggy-backed. For example, CHDs delivered nearly half of all global deworming treatments to preschool children in 2013, thus illustrating the strategic importance of this delivery mechanism for attaining high coverage of vital services targeting preschool-age children (Kumapley et al 2015). The design of CHDs and the package of interventions offered can be tailored to the local contexts; and in fragile health systems, CHDs serve as a major delivery platform for high-impact interventions targeted to preschool age children. Because the semi-annual delivery of VAS to preschool children is often the main driver behind CHDs, we feel it is important for cost per supplement delivered and cost-effectiveness models to consider these added benefits. The CHD delivery platform was largely propelled by the need to reach preschool-age children twice each year with a large dose of vitamin A.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines how operational processes—specifically, the design and tailoring of CHDs to local conditions—enable the bundling of multiple interventions. By integrating VAS with other health services, the delivery system becomes more efficient and cost-effective, underscoring the importance of local adaptation and stakeholder capacity in achieving better overall outcomes.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** Technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, training health workers and managers, policy design, planning and budgeting, and social mobilization for VAS programs (details in footnotes). Helen Keller mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that Helen Keller employs operational processes, such as providing training, planning, and technical support, to enhance local stakeholders' capabilities. By improving these operational processes, the charity helps ensure that interventions are effectively implemented, which in turn contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Increasing coverage rates: Helen Keller identifies districts or regions participating in mass campaigns that have low VAS coverage rates and provides sub-national governments in those regions with technical support.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that targeted technical support improves the operational capacity of local governments in lower-performing areas. Enhanced local execution leads to higher coverage rates for vitamin A supplementation, thereby improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** Causing VAS campaigns to occur: In the absence of external technical assistance and funding, Helen Keller told us that VAS campaigns and programs would not occur at all in some countries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the critical role of operational support in enabling interventions. Without such assistance to local stakeholders, essential campaigns might not be executed, which would negatively impact the charity's cost-effectiveness by reducing overall program reach and impact.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** By delivering VAS through preexisting government infrastructure, DEVTA tested not only the efficacy of VAS, but also the practicability of implementing large-scale VAS at low cost.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly links the use of existing local government infrastructure—a clear operational process that enhances local stakeholders’ ability to conduct interventions—to the low-cost, scalable delivery of the program, directly informing how such processes contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** VAS was administered by workers at village anganwadi child-care centers (AWCs) and children in the treatment blocks received 200,000 IU of vitamin A every six months.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the intervention was implemented using local community resources (AWCs), demonstrating how leveraging local stakeholders within established systems can lower operational costs and improve intervention delivery, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness for charities.

### Doc Name: 2017-10-9 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Planning VAS programs is critical, because campaigns may disrupt normal healthcare services if they are not done correctly. Therefore, planning and sensitization workshops are very important for the success of VAS campaigns. HKI currently runs workshops in which it teaches VAS program leaders how to organize teams and plan outreach strategies, among other things. If HKI had additional funding, it would organize district-based workshops with comprehensive, practical planning. It would do this by bringing districts together at a central point for two workshops in one week, and then would sponsor the districts to run similar workshops with facility nurses. It would also send supervisors into the field with health workers, so that the supervisors could address issues as they arose.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process that focuses on capacity building among local stakeholders through microplanning workshops, training, and field supervision. By improving local stakeholders’ ability to organize and execute interventions effectively, the process is designed to prevent disruptions and optimize resource allocation, thereby contributing indirectly to a charity’s overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HKI noted that the October 2017 Maternal and Child Health Week program appeared to have insufficient funding for microplanning and social mobilization. HKI would guess that between 40% and 60% of targeted preschool-aged children in Guinea will receive VAS through this program. If HKI had additional funding, it would like to provide financial and technical support to the government for these activities. The budget for the October 2017 Maternal and Child Health Week was also insufficient to support supervisors observing selected implementation sites--HKI would also like to be able to provide funding for these activities as well. With additional funding, HKI also believes it could enable a second Maternal and Child Health Week per year to occur.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that by improving operational processes—specifically, enhancing microplanning, communication, and supervision—local stakeholders could overcome current limitations, likely increasing the campaign’s coverage from 40–60% to an expected 80% with adequate support. This improvement in performance and efficiency of interventions is an example of how strengthening local capacity may lead to better cost effectiveness.

## Code: Securing local buy-in: Ensuring support for the charity’s intervention among local stakeholders.
### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 5.md
- **Quote:** Conduct meetings with key stakeholders (religious leaders, councillors etc)
- **Reasoning:** This operational step, listed under the planning phase, directly indicates an effort to secure local buy‐in by engaging influential local figures. By involving religious leaders and councillors, the process fosters local support and resource pooling, which can enhance efficiency and contribute to the overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** VASD information to be shared is authorised by the District executive Director (DED) and disseminated by District Medical Officer (DMO) to the health facilities who in‐turn informs community health workers (CHW). In ensuring that the communication reaches timely to all participating authorities, DMO is expected to share a copy of the information to ward and village government authorities who will disseminate the same to the lower levels. Strengthening social mobilisation exercise, DED is expected to share VASD event preparation 'count‐down' checklist with the district councillors (through the district chairperson) who would help in mobilising their respective communities.
- **Reasoning:** This detailed description of the communication flowchart illustrates how local stakeholder networks are systematically activated to ensure timely and broad dissemination of information. Engaging various local authorities—such as government officials and community workers—in this process secures their buy-in, streamlines operations, and likely reduces inefficiencies, ultimately contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** How can the district get more involved in advocacy? Educate. Inform your fellow district members as well as decision-makers about the current VASD policies and related problems affecting your communities. Evaluate. Evaluate all VASD responsibilities, and examine whether current activities involve advocacy as a means to address VASD coverage problems. If not, how could VASD advocacy play a larger role in your district? Collaborate. Work in coalitions with groups whose VASD philosophy and goals resonate with the district's. Together, pooling staff and resources, all parties involved in the coalition should be better equipped to take on events.
- **Reasoning:** This segment outlines a strategic advocacy process aimed at building local stakeholder support through education, evaluation, and collaboration. By promoting coalition‐building and resource sharing among district members and decision-makers, the process not only fosters local buy‐in but also optimizes resource use, which is a key mechanism for achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period. The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where local stakeholder support is secured through partnerships with the Bangladeshi government and local initiatives. By leveraging the government health system to deliver the intervention, additional staffing costs are avoided, directly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Transitioning to routine delivery of VAS can be challenging. When Kenya transitioned from door-to-door to routine delivery without technical assistance, coverage fell from roughly 90% to 20% during one campaign, and it took several years to bring coverage rates back up. HKI hopes to help prevent this in other places, since it is more difficult and requires more resources to bring coverage rates back up than to prevent them from falling.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the absence of operational support—specifically, technical assistance that helps secure local stakeholder buy-in during the transition of service delivery—leads to a dramatic drop in program coverage. The resulting inefficiencies imply higher costs to regain performance, thus underlining how robust operational processes contribute indirectly to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HKI expects its capacity to assist governments to transition to routine service delivery to be particularly critical over the next five years or so. HKI's flexibility to send teams from one region to another to provide technical assistance and build capacity has been valuable...

Their active participation in providing cost and funding details is an example of operational processes that secure local buy-in, which can lead to interventions that are better aligned with local resources and potentially more cost effective.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** One of the major challenges of implementing CMAM is determining the proper balance between external support and local control. Currently, there is a lack of evidence establishing what structure will be most conducive to program success and cost-effectiveness. This is an important problem to solve, because programs that bypass local health systems tend not to be cost-effective and struggle with sustainability. Involvement of local health systems is not sufficient on its own; the quality and manner in which the health system is integrated also affect sustainability in the long term. One possible strategy is to develop a hybrid program, where responsibility for implementing the program is shared between non-government organizations (NGOs), government agencies, local health systems, and community members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly links the integration of local stakeholders (securing local buy-in) with achieving cost-effectiveness. It explains that bypassing local systems can lead to higher costs and poor sustainability, while a hybrid approach that involves local government, health systems, and community members is seen as a path toward improved cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** As part of this community-based strategy, HKI has organized women's groups to support malnutrition screenings within communities and promote preventive infant and young child feeding practices.

- **Quote:** Training for additional staff members needed to work on VAS and deworming components of the campaign
- **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that part of the operational process for the VAS and deworming campaign in Mali includes training additional staff members. Although it does not elaborate in detail, it implies that investing in the training of local workforce (or additional campaign staff) is integral to the campaign's implementation. Such training, when combined with leveraging existing campaign infrastructure (e.g., shared costs with a polio immunization campaign), can contribute to cost effectiveness by ensuring efficient administration of interventions through local human resources.

### Doc Name: 2017-06-01 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Transitioning to routine delivery of VAS can be challenging. When Kenya transitioned from door-to-door to routine delivery without technical assistance, coverage fell from roughly 90% to 20% during one campaign, and it took several years to bring coverage rates back up.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the potential negative impact when technical assistance (and by extension, any training or capacity-building efforts) is lacking, as evidenced by the dramatic drop in coverage. Although it does not explicitly discuss cost effectiveness, it hints that investing in local capacity—potentially through training—helps avoid costly setbacks.

### Doc Name: 2018-04-09 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** In order to ensure the quality of CHDs, HKI usually dispatches nationally trained teams to conduct the campaigns. However, given the security situation in some parts of Mali, it is important to only send people who have in-depth knowledge of the region, so instead of a central team they are having local teams from each village collect data in their own areas. This approach has required more preparation than usual on HKI's part.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** In current CMAM programs, an NGO will typically partner with local health systems to implement the intervention. The NGO sends staff members to health centers on a regular basis, where they provide training and supervision to local health workers, ensuring that preventive counseling and food supplement provision is occurring as intended. After some period of time, the NGO typically withdraws from its direct role in health centers' work, in the hope that health centers will be able to maintain the program independently.
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the operational process in which the charity (through the NGO) trains local health workers—its local partners—by providing regular training and supervision. This capacity-building measure is designed to eventually enable local health systems to operate independently, thereby reducing the need for ongoing external support and lowering staff costs, which contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** Without the resources and motivation to replace an NGO's training and supervision services internally, health systems often revert back to their original practices, especially when health workers that have been trained in CMAM protocols move away and are replaced by untrained counterparts.
- **Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes the importance of sustaining the training and supervision of local health workforce skills. It indicates that effective and continuous training is critical for ensuring that local partners maintain their capability, thereby supporting program sustainability and cost-effectiveness by avoiding the need to continually reintroduce external training services.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** Technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, training health workers and managers, policy design, planning and budgeting, and social mobilization for VAS programs (details in footnotes). Helen Keller mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by illustrating that Helen Keller’s operational process includes the training of local health workers and managers—key local partners—which is intended to build workforce skills.

- **Quote:** Step 5. Supportive Supervision

* Using the 6-month contact point training as a guide, develop a supportive supervision checklist to be used to determine if key tasks are implemented, and to reinforce information learned during the training.
* Determine how often supportive supervision will be implemented in each participating health facility. This will depend on the number of facilities, number of supervisors available, time needed to travel to each facility and budget.
* Develop a Supportive Supervision schedule in which the supervisor will visit each participating health facility. The supervisor should observe the health worker, use the checklist to evaluate the health worker's performance, provide on-site support for tasks not completed correctly and discuss with the health worker any difficulties they have experienced.
- **Reasoning:** This passage outlines a clear monitoring process during the intervention implementation phase. It demonstrates how operational monitoring (through supportive supervision) is structured to ensure that key tasks are executed properly. By tying the frequency of supervision to factors like the number of facilities and budget constraints, it implicitly links the monitoring process to cost effectiveness, as resource allocation and timely corrective actions are essential for maintaining efficiency and preventing waste.

### Doc Name: 2021 HKI Documentation 3.md
- **Quote:** Objectives and process

The objective of Supportive Supervision [SS] is to improve performance of services through a series of steps:

1. Assess the performance of the services with the service provider (give the opportunity to the service provider to analyze his own practice as you fill up the checklist);
2. Identify areas of good performance and areas of insufficient performance, and acknowledge them both;
3. Identify the reasons for insufficient performance with the service provider and identify solutions together for improving performance;
4. Set an action plan that is time bound, measurable and achievable with the service provider and ensure that both supervisor and service provider sign off on it;
5. Re-assess the performance after a period agreed with the service provider and the achievement of the actions agreed upon by re‑starting at step 1. Make sure you consider the results of the previous SS exercise in the actions identified below. Also make sure the actions are proposed and agreed upon by the service provider and the facility in - charge
- **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the detailed, cyclical process of supportive supervision during implementation. It demonstrates how monitoring is structured through assessment, feedback, action planning, and re-assessment, which are key operational activities.

By collecting and rapidly analyzing data and holding workshops to review campaign performance, HKI uses monitoring as an operational tool to identify and correct issues early, which can prevent inefficiencies and help maintain high coverage levels—thus contributing to the cost effectiveness of its interventions.

- **Quote:** Transitioning to routine delivery of VAS can be challenging. When Kenya transitioned from door-to-door to routine delivery without technical assistance, coverage fell from roughly 90% to 20% during one campaign, and it took several years to bring coverage rates back up. HKI hopes to help prevent this in other places, since it is more difficult and requires more resources to bring coverage rates back up than to prevent them from falling.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the financial and operational risks associated with insufficient monitoring during intervention implementation. It implies that early detection (through monitoring) and timely technical assistance are critical to preventing sharp declines in coverage that are costly to remedy, highlighting how consistent monitoring can contribute to a more cost effective operational process.

### Doc Name: 2020-03-19 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** The NGO sends staff members to health centers on a regular basis, where they provide training and supervision to local health workers, ensuring that preventive counseling and food supplement provision is occurring as intended.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational monitoring process—through regular training and supervision—during the implementation of the intervention. Such monitoring helps ensure that activities occur as planned, which can contribute to maintaining fidelity and, by extension, cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** CMAM, like any community intervention, requires oversight from health facility staff. This oversight takes time and effort. It is unclear, in this model, how the oversight is expected to continue without additional resources.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the necessity of ongoing monitoring (oversight) as part of the operational process. It highlights that effective, sustained oversight is critical for ensuring proper implementation and can impact cost-effectiveness, although it also points to resource challenges that may affect this dynamic.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Response to GiveWell Assessment.md
- **Quote:** We provided GiveWell with evidence from two countries (Cameroon and Kenya) which demonstrated that HKI's technical assistance contributed to significantly higher coverage rates. We appreciate GiveWell's desire to understand HKI's added value by assessing VAS program performance using a counterfactual paradigm.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that HKI’s operational process—through the provision of technical assistance (a form of monitoring during implementation)—resulted in higher coverage rates. Improved coverage implies a more efficient use of resources, suggesting that active oversight during program implementation contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Unfortunately, due to the lack of funding in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire in 2017, HKI has been unable to provide VAS technical support to either country providing counterfactual examples. Sadly, both countries missed a VAS distribution round in the first semester of 2017 suggesting that in the absence of HKI's support the VAS programs in both countries were negatively affected. During their planned country visit, we encourage GiveWell to look further into the added value HKI provides to VAS coverage.
- **Reasoning:** This quote presents a counterexample where the absence of HKI’s technical support—implying an absence of monitoring during implementation—led to missed distribution rounds and poorer program performance. This contrast supports the notion that systematic monitoring during implementation is integral to achieving cost‑effective outcomes.

### Doc Name: 2021 HK Summary.md
- **Quote:** Technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, training health workers and managers, policy design, planning and budgeting, and social mobilization for VAS programs (details in footnotes).
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that monitoring is deliberately integrated into the charity’s operational process through technical assistance, ensuring that interventions are properly tracked and evaluated – a key step for assessing and achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We use results about the proportion of targeted children reached, along with data on program spending, to estimate the cost of treating a child with VAS.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows how data collected via monitoring (i.e., coverage surveys) directly feeds into calculations of cost per unit delivered. This operational use of real-time monitoring data is essential for determining and improving the program's cost effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2021 Info on Intervention.md
- **Quote:** DEVTA implemented multiple strategies for achieving high coverage and for monitoring the coverage rate. These strategies seem reasonable overall. However, we note that these strategies are not fully documented, may be prone to bias in some cases, and were often not in place until the second half of the study.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where monitoring (in this case, tracking coverage rates) is integrated during the implementation of the intervention. By ensuring that participants are indeed reached, such monitoring helps validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the intervention, which is essential for establishing its cost-effectiveness.

### Doc Name: 2017-10-9 Site Visit.md
- **Quote:** Survey teams in the field send cluster data via mobile connection every day, and an HKI team on the ground checks these data daily. This makes it difficult to falsify data. In the past, HKI has canceled some surveys in some sampled areas (and relied on back-up samples instead) if there are too many mistakes, or if a large amount of data was recorded at the same time (which might be because the surveyors are not actually walking from house to house and conducting interviews). In some cases, HKI has fired the teams responsible for such issues. HKI also has supervision teams that visit every survey team in the field at least once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details a real-time monitoring process during implementation where data is continuously checked and verified, enabling HKI to quickly correct errors (cancelling flawed surveys or firing non-compliant teams). Such oversight minimizes wasted resources and reinforces cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** HKI conducted many coverage surveys in Nigeria, and also supported independent monitoring, with 	150 monitors in nine states.
- **Reasoning:** This statement illustrates that HKI employs an extensive monitoring system across multiple regions, ensuring that intervention implementation is closely supervised. This systematic verification helps identify operational inefficiencies early, which contributes to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** After each campaign, it would fund four or five review workshops throughout the country, in which it would bring together five to ten districts to discuss monitoring and supervision data, determine coverage rates, and identify areas that needed improvement.
- **Reasoning:** This quote shows that monitoring is integrated into a post-campaign review process. By using monitoring data to inform decision-making and adjust strategies, HKI conduct ongoing performance assessments that help optimize resource allocation and enhance overall cost effectiveness.

These imposed requirements indicate a structured collaboration with local entities, which can contribute to cost effectiveness by leveraging existing local capacities and integrating campaign activities within pre‐established systems.

- **Quote:** HKI's budgets for VAS campaigns in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso in 2018 include grants (or "sub-agreements") to local and regional governments to support the implementation of the campaigns.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that HKI formalizes its operational processes by establishing sub‐agreements with local and regional governments. By imposing requirements through these grants, local stakeholders are engaged in campaign implementation, potentially reducing operational costs by utilizing local infrastructure and resources, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the interventions.

### Doc Name: 2020-09-15 Interview notes.md
- **Quote:** Mortality among newborns is highest in the first week of life. To maximize benefit from NVAS, newborns must be dosed within a few days of birth, which can be challenging in settings where most women give birth at home. Dr. Klemm and his colleagues worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Micronutrient Initiative (now Nutrition International) to test two different methods of delivering vitamin A to infants born at home. One group of mothers received the vitamin A during prenatal visits and were told to administer the dose to the newborn. The second group was asked to call a health worker, who would then visit the home and deliver the dose. The goal of the study was to measure how many newborns could be dosed using these methods in this time period. The results, which were not published, showed that approximately half of the targeted newborns received the dose. This was accomplished without hiring additional staff, as the doses were distributed via the government health system.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how operational processes that leverage local stakeholders—such as relying on mothers to administer the dose and utilizing the existing government health system—can minimize additional staffing costs, thereby contributing to the intervention's cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** How the newborn vitamin A dose is packaged and delivered can affect the cost of the intervention. If the vitamin A is administered at the time of birth to women giving birth in a health facility, or by a health worker during a postpartum visit, newborn vitamin A doses can be packaged in inexpensive plastic bottles. If, however, the vitamin A supplements are pre-delivered to a home of an expectant mother or given to a woman at an antenatal visit (for her to store until the birth of her baby), appropriate packaging will be required for each capsule, and this may be costly, adding to the overall cost of the intervention.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights that the method of delivery—imposing storage or handling requirements on local stakeholders—directly influences costs. It implies that operational choices regarding delivery can either enhance cost effectiveness (when using cost-saving practices) or increase expenses if more costly packaging is required.

- **Quote:** VAS is integrated into routine health service delivery for children aged six to 11 months. Children in this age group may receive VAS during their six‐month or nine‐month routine health system contacts, or if they visit a clinic for any other reason during this time.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where vitamin A supplementation is embedded within existing routine health service delivery. By leveraging local health facilities and their established routines, the process implicitly requires local stakeholders to include VAS in their service provision. This integration reduces the need for separate, costly campaigns, thus contributing to overall cost effectiveness—a core aspect of the research question.

- **Quote:** Integrating VAS into the April National Immunization Day, covering all 10 regions, is expected to cost $150,000, while a dedicated VAS campaign in only four regions could cost $500,000.
- **Reasoning:** This quote provides quantitative evidence that an operational decision—integrating VAS into an existing national event (and thereby imposing alignment with local immunization operations)—significantly reduces costs. It illustrates how the strategic imposition of additional responsibilities on local stakeholders within established processes can yield cost savings, directly relating to the research question on cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Implementation of campaigns will most likely not be disrupted, simply because Mali has a very long tradition of CHDs. In order to ensure the quality of CHDs, HKI usually dispatches nationally trained teams to conduct the campaigns. However, given the security situation in some parts of Mali, it is important to only send people who have in‐depth knowledge of the region, so instead of a central team they are having local teams from each village collect data in their own areas. This approach has required more preparation than usual on HKI's part.
- **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process in which HKI imposes a requirement on local stakeholders—mandating that only locally knowledgeable individuals collect data—to address security concerns. Although it notes an increase in preparatory work, this strategy is indicative of how leveraging local stakeholder expertise may contribute to improved quality and potentially cost‐effective operations under challenging conditions.

- **Quote:** One of the major challenges of implementing CMAM is determining the proper balance between external support and local control. Currently, there is a lack of evidence establishing what structure will be most conducive to program success and cost-effectiveness. This is an important problem to solve, because programs that bypass local health systems tend not to be cost-effective and struggle with sustainability. Involvement of local health systems is not sufficient on its own; the quality and manner in which the health system is integrated also affect sustainability in the long term. One possible strategy is to develop a hybrid program, where responsibility for implementing the program is shared between non-government organizations (NGOs), government agencies, local health systems, and community members.
- **Reasoning:** This quote explains that programs which integrate local stakeholders through a hybrid operational model (imposing requirements on local actors) are more cost-effective and sustainable than those that bypass them. It directly relates to understanding how including local actors in the program’s operational processes can contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** HKI believes that a well-run, government-funded version of the program could likely reduce the cost to $100 per child, as many of the associated costs are for staff salaries.
- **Reasoning:** This quote links local stakeholder involvement—specifically through a government-run funding model—to reduced operational costs (notably staff salaries), thereby contributing to the charity’s overall cost effectiveness. It provides concrete evidence on how imposing a requirement for local management can reduce program costs.

- **Quote:** Helen Keller provides technical assistance: Helen Keller assists governments with monitoring and evaluation, training health workers and managers, policy design, planning and budgeting, and social mobilization for VAS programs (details in footnotes). Helen Keller mainly focuses on providing technical assistance at the sub-national level, particularly to districts or regions that may have low VAS coverage rates.
- **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where Helen Keller imposes specific requirements on local government stakeholders by providing structured technical assistance. By mandating these procedures — such as training and planning — the organization ensures that local stakeholders implement VAS programs effectively, which supports cost effectiveness by achieving high coverage rates.

- **Quote:** Increasing coverage rates: Helen Keller identifies districts or regions participating in mass campaigns that have low VAS coverage rates and provides sub-national governments in those regions with technical support.
- **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that Helen Keller’s operational strategy includes setting performance standards for local stakeholders. By requiring local governments to meet these benchmarks and providing technical support, the charity improves campaign coverage, thereby lowering the cost per vitamin A supplement delivered and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Health workers implementing VAS programs are instructed to cut vitamin A capsules open with scissors and squeeze the contents of the capsules directly into children's mouths. Health workers are also instructed to ask caregivers about the age of the child in order to provide the correct dosage of vitamin A: 100,000 IU for 6-11 month-old infants, and 200,000 IU to 12-59 month-old children.
- **Reasoning:** This operational directive imposes clear requirements on local health workers, a key group of local stakeholders. Ensuring precise and standardized administration of vitamin A through strict procedures minimizes errors and wastage, directly contributing to the charity’s low cost per unit delivered and thus enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** By delivering VAS through preexisting government infrastructure, DEVTA tested not only the efficacy of VAS, but also the practicability of implementing large-scale VAS at low cost.
- **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational strategy where the program leverages existing local stakeholder infrastructure (village anganwadi child-care centers) to deliver vitamin A supplementation. This approach minimizes additional costs and demonstrates how imposing a reliance on local stakeholders can contribute to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** It is also possible that DEVTA's results were significantly affected by the exclusion of areas without functioning AWCs. VAS might have had greater efficacy in areas without functioning AWCs, which we suspect are more remote (and therefore may have more severe or prevalent VAD and worse overall health) than the areas covered by DEVTA. However, it may also be more costly to implement VAS in these areas, so it is not clear what the net impact on cost-effectiveness would be of extending the program to other areas.
- **Reasoning:** This quote underscores that operational processes relying on well-functioning local stakeholder systems (AWCs) are integral to achieving low costs. It suggests that when local infrastructure is lacking, the additional costs required to establish or substitute for these processes can affect overall cost-effectiveness, thereby directly relating local operational requirements to charity cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** HKI currently runs workshops in which it teaches VAS program leaders how to organize teams and plan outreach strategies, among other things. If HKI had additional funding, it would organize district-based workshops with comprehensive, practical planning. It would do this by bringing districts together at a central point for two workshops in one week, and then would sponsor the districts to run similar workshops with facility nurses. It would also send supervisors into the field with health workers, so that the supervisors could address issues as they arose.
- **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process that imposes requirements on local stakeholders—such as program leaders, district teams, and facility nurses—to participate in structured training and supervision. By standardizing planning and oversight through these workshops and field visits, HKI aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its VAS campaigns, which contributes to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Survey teams in the field send cluster data via mobile connection every day, and an HKI team on the ground checks these data daily. This makes it difficult to falsify data. In the past, HKI has canceled some surveys in some sampled areas (and relied on back-up samples instead) if there are too many mistakes, or if a large amount of data was recorded at the same time (which might be because the surveyors are not actually walking from house to house and conducting interviews). In some cases, HKI has fired the teams responsible for such issues. HKI also has supervision teams that visit every survey team in the field at least once.
- **Reasoning:** This quote details an operational process that requires local survey teams to adhere to strict data collection and reporting protocols. By enforcing daily submissions and verifying data quality—with consequences such as canceling surveys or firing non-compliant teams—HKI minimizes errors and potential cost overruns, thereby supporting overall cost effectiveness.
