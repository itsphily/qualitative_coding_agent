- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention to a location with unique operational challenges—very remote communities—by deploying mobile money as an alternative delivery channel. This adaptation in operational processes implies a strategy geared toward efficiency, an essential component of achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly is adapting its operational processes in Uganda by replicating a structure that already works in Kenya. By separating roles and decentralizing operations based on the local context, the charity aims to reduce fraud and improve efficiency—components that contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its financial transfer methods to match the local market conditions. By switching to a mobile money provider with a broader agent network, the charity adapts its intervention to the local context, thereby potentially increasing operational flexibility and reducing inefficiencies, which are key factors in achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its eligibility criteria based on the local context. By recognizing that a common indicator (thatched roofs) does not apply uniformly across locations (e.g., in Homa Bay County), the organization tailors its intervention to more effectively target extreme poverty, which likely enhances cost effectiveness through more efficient allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly is adjusting its intervention—in this case, the size of cash transfers—in response to local economic conditions like inflation. By recalibrating transfer amounts to reflect the real value in Kenya, the organization ensures that its operations remain efficient and cost effective, despite fluctuating local economic circumstances.

- **Quote:** The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly’s operational processes are tailored to the specifics of each location. By calculating efficiency targets based on local costs and staffing needs, the organization adapts its operational practices to the unique economic context of each country, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to the unique specifics of a location where mobile-payment infrastructure is limited. By leveraging existing local agents and community members instead of building its own infrastructure, the organization aims to lower costs and improve the efficiency of its cash distribution, directly relating to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy based on local regulatory and operational environments. By reallocating funds to Rwanda when conditions in Uganda become challenging, the charity adapts to local specifics in order to maintain smoother operations and likely achieve better cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group)...

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its beneficiary targeting process based on local feedback and conditions. Tailoring enrollment criteria to the unique specifics of a location can streamline operations and ensure resources are directed efficiently, thereby contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapted its operational processes to meet local regulatory and administrative requirements in Rwanda, leading to smoother registration and faster team hiring. Such tailored adaptation to local specifics can contribute to cost effectiveness by streamlining implementation and reducing operational delays.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that by leveraging existing, locally adapted operational processes, GiveDirectly achieves cost efficiency. It implies that adapting interventions to locations where the organization already has tailored systems avoids the extra costs and complexities associated with establishing new operations, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly has adapted its operational process to the local context by leveraging Kenya’s widely used mobile money platform (M-Pesa). Using an existing local financial infrastructure likely reduces transaction costs and streamlines delivery, which contributes to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity tailors its targeting method to location-specific indicators—in this case, using the presence of thatch roofs as a proxy for poverty in Kenya. Such local adaptation in the selection process can improve accuracy and efficiency in reaching the intended beneficiaries, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the intervention is tailored based on local epidemiological data and infrastructure characteristics. By targeting areas with specific water source types, disease burdens, and population density, DSW adapts its intervention to local needs, an approach that likely enhances the cost effectiveness of its operations by focusing resources where they will have the most impact.

- **Quote:** Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides a clear example of how the charity adapts its operational process to fit the unique specifics of each location. By establishing strict criteria for water point selection based on local conditions, DSW minimizes investments in suboptimal sites, thereby promoting cost effective use of resources and ensuring that each dispenser installation is likely to yield high operational effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the process of learning and adaptation based on local feedback. Recognizing a placement issue in an earlier pilot led to an adjustment in the installation guidelines. Such adaptive changes in operational processes help ensure that future implementations are more suited to local conditions, which in turn can improve usage rates and overall cost effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly shows that GiveDirectly adapts its intervention based on local specifics—namely, the weakness of local mobile money agent networks—by organizing cash out days near the villages. This adaptation not only meets the unique situational needs of the recipients but also contributes to cost effectiveness by reducing transportation costs, thereby streamlining the operational process.
