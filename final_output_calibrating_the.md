- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote is directly relevant to the research question as it details how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational intervention by employing mobile money to overcome the inherent challenges of reaching very remote communities, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Benchmarking the impact of cash transfers in Malawi
  
  **Location:**: Machinga and Chiradzulu districts, Malawi
  **Overview:**: This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes ($250 to $750) on a broad range of outcome measures, for a broad range of recipients. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions in Malawi can be assessed. It will also test whether improving access to agricultural input markets increases the impact of cash transfers.
  **Study registration:**: Registration pending
  **Status:**: Baseline surveying and cash payments launched in 2019

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of location-specific modifications to operational interventions. In Malawi, GiveDirectly is not only testing varied transfer sizes but also exploring the integration of improved access to agricultural input markets, which is an adjustment made in response to the local economic context to improve cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational structure in Uganda based on local challenges by relocating functions (such as the complaint hotline) to a different part of the country, a strategy already in use in Kenya. This adaptation addresses location-specific oversight needs and contributes to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows an operational adjustment based on local financial infrastructure. By switching from EZEE Money to MTN Mobile Money, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to the broader agent network available locally, improving accessibility and likely reducing transaction inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly's Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a strategic differentiation in operational interventions based on location. It demonstrates that GiveDirectly plans to use Uganda as a site for experimental projects—reflecting a tailored approach to local conditions—while maintaining a more efficient, established model in Kenya, thereby optimizing cost effectiveness in each context.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  
  Adjusting transfer sizes for inflation
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts an operational intervention—increasing transfer amounts in Kenya—to account for local economic conditions (notably inflation). By indexing transfers to inflation, the charity seeks to maintain cost-effectiveness in its operations.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.
  
  The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.

  **Reasoning:** This passage highlights that GiveDirectly customizes its budgeting and operational efficiency targets based on local cost structures. The lower efficiency targets in Uganda reflect adjustments made to ensure that operational activities remain cost effective in different settings.

- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
  
  The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt indicates that GiveDirectly adapts its targeting measures based on local characteristics. By modifying eligibility criteria—such as moving away from a thatched roof proxy in areas where thatch is uncommon—the organization tailors its intervention to local conditions, thereby enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner.
  
  Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adapting its cash distribution methods to the local context in Uganda. Transitioning from a payday model to testing a distributed cashout approach, and adjusting communication to overcome local challenges, illustrates how the organization modifies operational procedures to enhance efficiency and cost effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Some recipients, especially elderly ones, have to learn how to use cell phones for the first time in order to manage the GiveDirectly transfers in mobile money accounts. These people have a more difficult time understanding how to keep their phones secure; for example, they often keep the phone in its original packaging and do not conceal it. Another problem with security is that some recipients will share the PIN numbers for their mobile money accounts, either intentionally or unintentionally by handing the phone to a mobile money agent before pressing "Send" (so the PIN number is still apparent on the screen of the phone.) This makes recipients more vulnerable to people who wanted to steal money from their accounts. Teaching PIN saftey has long been a priority, and GiveDirectly has added additional emphasis on the topic (e.g.,

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly recognizes local user characteristics—such as elderly recipients being unfamiliar with cell phone security—and adjusts its intervention (through added training and emphasis on PIN safety) to mitigate risks, which can contribute to cost effectiveness by reducing losses and inefficiencies.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This location-based organizational change shows that GiveDirectly adapts its operational structure (by geographically separating teams) to address issues (such as potential collusion or fraud) that may be prevalent in certain locations, thereby enhancing operational oversight and contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates how GiveDirectly tailors its intervention in response to specific local challenges—in this case, the coordinated gaming behavior in a Kenyan village—by pausing transfers and engaging directly with the community. These adjustments are indicative of a strategy aimed at preventing resource misallocation, thus supporting cost effective operations in different locales.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:
  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.
  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational interventions to suit the local characteristics of an area with limited mobile-payment infrastructure. By considering alternative methods such as mobilizing agents from other regions or utilizing community members as informal agents, the organization demonstrates a strategy aimed at lowering costs and increasing efficiency, directly addressing how operational adjustments can be tailored based on local conditions.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly modifies its intervention approach by adopting different targeting criteria based on local feedback and contextual factors in Homa Bay County. This adjustment reflects how the charity aligns its operational interventions with the specific characteristics of a location, an important element in enabling cost-effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its operational approach by focusing on existing locations where serving large populations of the extreme poor is cost efficient, rather than expanding geographically, which would increase costs. It directly addresses how the charity tailors its strategy based on local cost-effectiveness considerations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an example of operational adjustment in response to location-specific conditions. In Rwanda, due to tight government regulation and favorable conditions for rapid team-building, GiveDirectly adapted its operational interventions—such as accelerating registration and hiring processes—to suit the local context and maintain cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:
  1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.
  2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.
  3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.

  **Reasoning:** This quote outlines the criteria under which GiveDirectly would adjust its geographic and operational strategy, indicating that they rigorously evaluate the cost efficiency and benefits of operating in a new location based on local needs and funding conditions. This decision-making process is a form of adapting interventions to location-specific characteristics.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly leverages a locally prevalent technology—in this case, M-Pesa—to facilitate cash transfers. Using a mobile money system tailored to Kenya’s financial infrastructure is a clear example of adjusting operational interventions in line with local context to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** Here, the charity uses a locally relevant, observable indicator (thatched roofs) as a proxy for poverty. This method of targeting beneficiaries based on a characteristic specific to the local environment reflects an operational adaptation designed to ensure that transfers are cost-effective by focusing on the poorest households.

- **Quote:** In YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.

  **Reasoning:** This quote from the Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda shows that the intervention is structured to meet local labor market needs by targeting a specific demographic—young, rural, underemployed individuals—and organizing them into groups. Such design choices are adaptations to local socioeconomic conditions aimed at enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the program.

- **Quote:** 1. Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the intervention is deliberately targeted using location-specific data such as health indicators and water source types, indicating that the program adjusts its operations based on local characteristics to maximize impact and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 6. Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This detailed criteria reflects how the intervention is adjusted based on specific characteristics of each water source, ensuring that dispensers are only installed where they will be effective. By adapting the operational strategy to local conditions, the program enhances cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the program learns from initial pilot experiences by modifying its operational procedures (in this case, dispenser placement), thereby adjusting to local context and optimizing the intervention's efficiency and cost effectiveness.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational intervention—by organizing cash out days—in response to local conditions such as limited liquidity in the agent network and high transportation costs. This tailoring of intervention based on local characteristics directly addresses the research question regarding cost effectiveness.
