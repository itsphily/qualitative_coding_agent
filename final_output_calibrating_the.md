- **Quote:** Transfers to coffee-farming communities
  Researchers: Ilinsight and GiveDirectly
  Location: Iganga district, Uganda
  Overview: The study evaluated the impact of $1,000 cash transfers to Ugandan communities where coffee-farming is common. It found that consumption, assets, food security, and earnings all increased for both coffee farmers and households that don't produce coffee. Coffee farmers increased their investment in coffee farming, as well as in other livelihoods.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a tailored intervention strategy by focusing on communities with a specific local economic activity (coffee farming). By designing cash transfers for a context where coffee-farming is central, GiveDirectly adapts its operational process to local needs, which can enhance cost effectiveness through more relevant spending and investment increases.

- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.
  Status: Project complete and report published
  Blogs: GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides clear evidence of how operational challenges in a specific location (very remote areas) are addressed by tailoring the delivery method—in this case, using mobile money. This adaptation is a direct example of how the charity adjusts its intervention strategy to local conditions to ensure efficient and cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** Benchmarking the impact of cash transfers in DRC delivered to urban youth
  Researchers: Jeremy Magruder (UC Berkeley) and Benjamin Krausse (UC Berkeley) with measurement by Marakuja Kivu Research
  Location: Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo
  Overview: This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes to young people living in an urban environment on a broad range of outcome measures. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions targeting young people in DRC can be assessed. It will also explore the impact of varying transfer timing to inform future cash transfer program design.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an approach tailored to an urban context by varying transfer sizes and timing for young people in Goma. Such adjustments indicate that the charity is actively considering local demographics and the distinctive challenges of an urban setting to inform the optimal design of its cash transfer programs, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its geographic focus based on local ethnic and political dynamics, indicating that the charity adjusts its intervention strategy according to location-specific factors, which is a key aspect of operational tailoring that can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly renewed both national registration and Bukedea District-specific registration for one year. The amount GiveDirectly moves in that year will depend more on fundraising than on approvals. Bukedea has room for about $23 million in transfer opportunities.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to the local regulatory and market context, tailoring the scale and approach of its interventions based on the specific opportunities and constraints in Uganda, thereby impacting cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency).

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is deliberately designing different intervention models for different locations—using Uganda as a testbed for experimental projects—which exemplifies how the charity tailors its operational strategy to local contexts in pursuit of optimizing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that operational adjustments are made in Uganda to align with more robust processes already in place in Kenya, reflecting a location-specific tailoring of operational procedures aimed at minimizing risks such as fraud and enhancing overall cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adjusts its targeting criteria based on local contextual factors—in this case, the commonality of thatch roofs. By tailoring the eligibility metric to the specifics of a location, the organization aims to more accurately target extreme poverty, which can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an operational modification tailored to the specific economic conditions of Kenya. By adjusting transfer sizes in response to local inflation, GiveDirectly works to maintain the real value of the intervention and uphold cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how GiveDirectly is rethinking and tailoring its cash distribution strategy in Uganda to better fit local logistical constraints. Adjusting the cashout mechanism based on local conditions reflects an operational process that can improve efficiency and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment tailored to the local context in Uganda. By relocating the call center to Kampala while maintaining field staff in Mbale, GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention processes to mitigate risks (such as fraudulent activities) that might be influenced by geographic and local organizational factors, an approach that can enhance overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy in response to location-specific challenges. The decision to hold a community meeting and pause transfers in a Kenyan village with unique gaming issues reflects an adaptive operational process, targeting localized problems to prevent resource misallocation and improve overall program integrity and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** * **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly adapts its cash transfer distribution method based on local mobile-payment infrastructure constraints, illustrating an operational adjustment tailored to each location that can enhance cost effectiveness by avoiding unnecessary investments in new infrastructure.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly customizes its beneficiary targeting strategy based on local context and community feedback, thereby tailoring the intervention to the specific needs of the location and potentially contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly modifies its geographic focus and funding allocation based on local regulatory and operational contexts, thereby tailoring its intervention strategy to different locations to maintain smooth operations and cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows an operational strategy in which GiveDirectly is tailoring its intervention approach specifically for Rwanda by testing different methods (cash transfers versus alternatives) to identify the most effective and cost‐efficient model in that local context.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly adapted its operational processes to align with Rwanda's specific regulatory environment and logistical realities, thereby contributing to cost efficiency by streamlining local capacity-building and coordination efforts.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote underscores a strategic decision to concentrate resources in existing locations where operational infrastructure is already established, reflecting how local context and cost considerations shape the charity’s intervention strategies.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.102 While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.103

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the charity tailors its intervention to the local context by leveraging Kenya's established mobile money system (M-Pesa) and using a locally relevant indicator (thatch roofs) to identify poor households. These location-specific adaptations help streamline beneficiary targeting and reduce distribution costs, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.160 In general, participants were 'young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed.'161

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt illustrates a tailored intervention strategy in Northern Uganda, where the program specifically targets young adults for vocational training in skilled trades. By aligning its structure with the local demographic and economic context, the program is designed to meet locally relevant needs, an approach that can enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that charities assess alternative delivery mechanisms based on local infrastructure and cost considerations. The use of cell phone transfers—which reduces travel distance for recipients (0.9 km vs. 4.04 km for physical cash)—reflects an operational adaptation to local conditions that, over time, can lower costs and improve overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how the organization tailors its intervention strategy by selecting target areas based on specific local data such as disease prevalence and the type of water sources. Tailoring in this way likely increases cost effectiveness by focusing resources where they are most needed.

- **Quote:** Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This passage details the specific, location-tailored criteria used to select water points for installing the dispensers. By incorporating local conditions such as turbidity, household usage, and operational reliability, DSW tailors its interventions to maximize effectiveness and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that the charity adapts its operational processes based on local feedback. The iterative improvement of placement guidelines demonstrates an effort to refine the intervention strategy in response to location-specific challenges, potentially enhancing cost effectiveness over time.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where actionable information (time and location) is conveyed to recipients and local mobile money agents are coordinated, showcasing how intervention logistics are tailored to local conditions.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This passage directly explains that the charity adapts its strategy based on local infrastructural challenges by organizing cash out days, thereby reducing transportation costs and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.
