- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to meet the unique challenges of remote locations. By leveraging mobile money as a delivery mechanism in Lamwo District, Uganda, the charity calibrates its intervention to ensure safe, secure, and cost-effective cash transfers in areas where conventional methods might be hindered by logistical challenges.

- **Quote:** Cash transfers and disaster response
  
  Location: Houston, USA and Puerto Rico
  
  Overview: Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them. The diversity of needs translated to a wide range of reported benefits.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that GiveDirectly tailors its operational processes to the specific situational demands in disaster-impacted areas. The efficient, flexible cash-based response in Houston and Puerto Rico highlights how interventions are calibrated to the local context, suggesting that such location-specific adaptations contribute to optimizing cost-effectiveness.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly calibrates its operational focus based on local demographic factors and poverty levels, highlighting a process where location-specific characteristics are considered for the design of interventions that may enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program. GiveDirectly has worked in one and received approval to work in a second (Ugunja Division).

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates an operational process where the charity leverages location-specific poverty data to target its interventions, suggesting that calibrating based on local district eligibility helps optimize resource allocation, which is a key aspect of cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly renewed both national registration and Bukedea District-specific registration for one year. The amount GiveDirectly moves in that year will depend more on fundraising than on approvals. Bukedea has room for about $23 million in transfer opportunities.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly's operational processes include obtaining district-specific approvals and evaluating local transfer opportunity scales, indicating that tailoring interventions to specific local contexts is part of their strategy to maximize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.
  In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts cash transfer amounts in response to local economic conditions (such as differing inflation rates in Kenya versus Uganda), demonstrating a location-specific operational calibration aimed at maintaining cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its targeting criteria based on local environmental and cultural factors, adapting its intervention design to ensure more accurate beneficiary identification and thereby optimize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.

  **Reasoning:** This passage reveals that GiveDirectly formulates location-specific efficiency targets during the budgeting process, taking into account local cost structures and operational needs, which is a clear instance of using local calibration to optimize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its cash disbursement methods to local contextual factors such as infrastructure and technology access, thereby fine-tuning its operational processes to enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a clear location-specific operational adjustment where the call center is deliberately situated in a different city than the field teams. Such spatial separation is a calibration strategy that can enhance oversight and reduce risks (such as fraud), indirectly supporting optimized cost effectiveness by safeguarding funds and streamlining operations.

- **Quote:** Mr. Skeates will still spend one week per month in Mbale, Uganda, to oversee the ongoing Uganda 2M campaign.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a deliberate allocation of managerial time based on geographic needs, ensuring that local operations in Mbale receive direct oversight. Although it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, this location-specific staffing decision can contribute to efficient resource management and improved operational effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:
  
  * **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
  
  * **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly.** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence that GiveDirectly is exploring multiple operational strategies tailored to the specific conditions of a location, such as the availability of mobile-payment infrastructure. By testing different methods, the organization aims to calibrate its intervention to local infrastructure constraints—a direct example of leveraging location-specific factors to reduce costs and optimize operational efficiency.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its funding and operational strategy based on the varying regulatory and political environments of different countries. By shifting some cash transfer operations to Rwanda in response to unfavorable conditions in Uganda, the charity is engaging in location-specific calibration intended to optimize cost effectiveness and project sustainability.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly employs location-specific calibration in its enrollment process by adopting distinct targeting criteria that are informed by local context and community feedback. This tailored approach is designed to ensure that interventions align with the specific needs of populations in different regions, which can contribute to optimizing the cost effectiveness of the interventions.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly connects to the research question by showing that GiveDirectly adjusts (or calibrates) its operational focus based on geographic location; it opts to maximize cost effectiveness by leveraging existing country operations rather than incurring the added costs of establishing new ones.

- **Quote:** However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:
  1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.
  2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.
  3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.

  **Reasoning:** This passage outlines explicit criteria for considering geographical expansion, indicating that location-specific factors (such as unique policy research needs or funding opportunities) are weighed against operational costs. This reflects a calibrated approach to determining where interventions will be most cost effective.

- **Quote:** While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly leverages a location-specific indicator—thatch roofs—to identify poor households. By using a locally relevant characteristic, the charity calibrates its targeting process to the local context, a strategy that can enhance the cost-effectiveness of its intervention.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the operational process is tailored to the local technological environment. By using M-Pesa, a mobile money platform widely used in Kenya, the charity reduces distribution costs and logistical complexity, thus optimizing cost effectiveness in that specific location.

- **Quote:** Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 estimated that iron roofs cost about $564 USD PPP based on a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.109 GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.151 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.

  **Reasoning:** This passage indicates that GiveDirectly collects location-specific data—surveying roof costs across multiple villages—to refine its financial estimates. By calibrating intervention metrics based on local market prices, the charity can better assess and optimize the cost effectiveness of its program.

- **Quote:** 1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly details how DSW leverages local data—such as disease rates, water source types, and population density—to select intervention areas, demonstrating a location-specific calibration process aimed at maximizing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 6. **Choose water points for dispensers.** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote outlines specific, location-based criteria for selecting water points that are optimal for installing the chlorine dispensers. By ensuring that each chosen site meets a set of defined local conditions, DSW’s process supports cost-effective allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality.

  **Reasoning:** This passage explains the rationale behind targeting Western Kenya by highlighting its unique local conditions. It illustrates how an understanding of location-specific factors—water access, disease prevalence, and population density—guides intervention placement for maximized impact and cost efficiency.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its operational process by selecting withdrawal locations based on local conditions. By choosing sites within or near the villages, they minimize transportation costs for recipients, which is a clear example of leveraging location-specific calibration to optimize cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the preparatory steps taken that are finely tuned to local contexts. The advance notification of location and coordination with local mobile money agents demonstrate the charity’s process of adjusting its intervention based on specific local infrastructure and requirements, thereby contributing indirectly to cost effectiveness.
