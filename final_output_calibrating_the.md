- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its operational processes to address location-specific challenges—in this case, the difficulties of reaching very remote communities—by employing mobile money as an efficient delivery channel. This adaptation enhances the safety, security, and efficiency of the intervention, indirectly supporting overall cost effectiveness by lowering operational barriers and costs.

- **Quote:** Cash transfers and disaster response
  
  Location: Houston, USA and Puerto Rico
  
  Overview: Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them. The diversity of needs translated to a wide range of reported benefits.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence from a disaster response scenario, where GiveDirectly calibrated its intervention to meet the urgent and varied needs of hurricane-impacted communities. The operational process—delivering cash quickly and flexibly—demonstrates that tailoring interventions to local circumstances can yield efficient and beneficial outcomes, which is a key component of overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment where GiveDirectly switches from a limited network (EZEE Money) to a broader alternative (MTN) to better match local financial service realities. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, this calibration approach likely reduces bottlenecks and improves efficiency in funds distribution.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly's agenda has no political or ethnic bias.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the charity’s contemplation of adjusting its geographic targeting based on local ethnic and political contexts. Tailoring intervention locations can be seen as a calibration strategy, aiming for more context-sensitive deployments that may indirectly enhance overall cost effectiveness through better resource targeting.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This operational change, implemented in response to fraud issues in Uganda, adjusts the process by decoupling roles based on location. While primarily aimed at improving oversight and reducing fraud, it also reflects a calibration to local conditions that could contribute to better cost effectiveness by minimizing losses and enhancing accountability.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of an operational process where GiveDirectly adjusts its cash transfer amounts to account for local economic conditions (in this case, inflation in Kenya). By recalibrating transfer sizes to match the local cost environment, the organization aims to preserve its cost-effectiveness in delivering resources—ensuring that a high percentage of donated funds reaches beneficiaries.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a calibration approach in targeting interventions based on location-specific characteristics. By adapting its eligibility criteria to the local context (e.g., modifying the poverty proxy in Homa Bay County), GiveDirectly demonstrates an operational process aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and, potentially, the overall cost-effectiveness of its programs.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is actively modifying its intervention protocols—altering cash out day procedures and targeting criteria—in a way that suggests calibration to local contextual needs. While it does not explicitly state that these changes improve cost effectiveness, the operational adjustment implies an effort to optimize outcomes in response to specific local challenges.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This operational change, which shifts the call center to a different location than the field staff, indicates a location-specific adjustment designed to reduce risks (such as fraud) that emerged in earlier operations. Although the text does not directly connect this change to overall cost effectiveness, it reflects a calibration approach intended to enhance program integrity and efficiency.

- **Quote:** In 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of a calibration process where the intervention (transfer size) is adjusted in response to local economic conditions (inflation). The adjustment is meant to preserve the real value of transfers, which is a factor that could contribute to long‐term cost effectiveness, though the document does not offer direct evidence of improved cost efficiency as an outcome.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational process to suit location-specific conditions (areas with low mobile-payment infrastructure) by adopting alternative distribution methods. Although cost effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, the implied aim is to maintain service delivery while reducing infrastructure costs, which supports the research question on calibration contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a calibration approach by modifying targeting criteria based on local feedback in Homa Bay. By adjusting the intervention to meet specific local needs, GiveDirectly aims to optimize resource allocation. While the quote does not explicitly tie this change to cost effectiveness, tailoring the intervention to local vulnerabilities likely enhances cost effectiveness, directly addressing the research question.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly addresses the research question by showing that GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention based on location-specific conditions. By choosing to focus on areas where it already operates, the organization minimizes the costs associated with setting up new country operations, thereby enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides evidence of an operational process where GiveDirectly tailors its activities to the specific regulatory and operational context of Rwanda. By adapting processes such as registration and hiring in response to local conditions, the organization demonstrates a calibration approach that likely contributes to efficient and cost effective operations.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly has adapted its delivery method to leverage Kenya’s existing mobile money infrastructure, a clear example of an operational process tailored to a location’s specific financial ecosystem. Such adaptation can reduce distribution costs and streamline transfers, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Treatment households were cross-randomized into three arms, which varied the gender of the recipient (when households had both male and female household heads), the frequency of the transfer (lump-sum v. monthly installment), and the size of the transfer ($287 v. $1,085).

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of how the intervention is experimentally calibrated by adjusting key parameters (transfer size, frequency, and recipient characteristics). By testing different configurations, GiveDirectly can determine which operational model best meets recipient needs and maximizes impact relative to cost, thereby informing a more cost-effective approach.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational process where the charity uses a locally relevant indicator (the use of thatch roofs) to identify poverty in a specific context. This targeted selection process is an example of calibrating the intervention to local conditions, potentially increasing the cost-effectiveness by ensuring that transfers reach those most in need.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that DSW tailors its operational process by selecting intervention locations based on local health and water characteristics. By targeting areas with higher need, the intervention is calibrated to local conditions, which potentially improves overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence of a calibration approach by outlining specific, location-based criteria for selecting water points. By ensuring that dispensers are installed in optimal locations, DSW increases the likelihood of effective usage and, hence, the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates the iterative adjustment process where DSW learns from pilot experiences to refine its operational procedures. The update of placement instructions based on local observations exemplifies calibration to local needs, which is a mechanism expected to contribute to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention to meet a location-specific need—addressing the lack of a robust mobile money agent network. By organizing cash out days close to the recipient villages, the charity reduces transportation costs and thereby enhances cost effectiveness, directly supporting the calibration approach described in the research question.
