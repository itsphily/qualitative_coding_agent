- **Quote:** Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a clear operational adaptation where GiveDirectly addresses the unique challenges of remote areas by employing mobile money. By adapting the delivery method based on location-specific conditions, the organization ensures efficient and likely more cost-effective cash transfer programs.

- **Quote:** Overview: Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them. The diversity of needs translated to a wide range of reported benefits.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention during disaster response in specific locations. By tailoring cash transfers to the emergency context and emphasizing flexibility and operational efficiency, the organization meets diverse local needs, contributing to an effective and cost-effective intervention strategy.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational adaptation based on location-specific conditions. In Uganda, due to its smaller network and associated risks (as seen in the fraud case), the charity has restructured roles (moving hotline and followup calls to a separate location) similar to practices already in place in Kenya, thereby potentially reducing risk and improving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows how GiveDirectly adapts its transfer mechanism by opting for a mobile money provider with broader local coverage. The switch is based on understanding location-specific limitations (a limited EZEE agent network) and leveraging MTN’s extensive network to enhance operational efficiency and, by extension, cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_and_Carolina_Toth_9-7-15_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
  
  The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its targeting intervention based on location-specific conditions. In Homa Bay County, where thatch is not prevalent, the organization recognizes the need to change its proxy means test. This adaptation is an example of tailoring interventions to local contexts, which in turn supports ensuring cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Adjusting transfer sizes for inflation
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.
  
  In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900.

  **Reasoning:** This passage provides concrete evidence of an operational adaptation to local economic conditions. By adjusting transfer sizes—principally raising amounts in Kenya due to inflation while noting different conditions in Uganda—GiveDirectly demonstrates its process of modifying interventions based on location-specific factors to maintain the real value of aid and overall cost-effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that following a location-specific incident (fraud in the Uganda pilot), GiveDirectly modified its operational procedures. It highlights how the charity adapts its intervention processes in response to local challenges to maintain program integrity and cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.

  **Reasoning:** This adaptation demonstrates a strategic geographic reorganization of operations based on local conditions. By relocating the call center to Kampala, GiveDirectly is addressing a location-specific risk factor, thus ensuring improved oversight and potentially enhancing cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** One village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows a location-specific operational adaptation where GiveDirectly responds to unusual local behavior (gaming) by pausing transfers and engaging with the community. Such a reactive measure is indicative of how the charity adjusts its interventions at the local level to prevent misallocation of funds and uphold cost effectiveness.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** * **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adapts its cash transfer distribution process based on a location-specific condition—namely, the lack of mobile-payment infrastructure. By proposing alternative methods tailored to areas with limited infrastructure, the charity is modifying its intervention to maintain operational efficiency and potentially cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Allocation of funds across countries
  
  GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows that GiveDirectly is responsive to location-specific regulatory and operational conditions. By shifting some funding to Rwanda when Uganda’s environment becomes less favorable, the organization is adapting its intervention strategy based on local conditions, which can contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Targeting in Homa Bay
  
  All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adaptation in targeting practices that is specific to the local context in Homa Bay County. By revising targeting criteria based on local focus group feedback, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to local demographics and needs, a process that can enhance cost effectiveness by ensuring resources are directed where they are most impactful.


### Paul_Niehaus_Carolina_Toth_Ian_Bassin_08-12-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention strategy by conducting benchmarking experiments in Rwanda, testing multiple intervention approaches in a specific location to evaluate cost effectiveness under local conditions.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes in response to local, location-specific conditions—specifically the regulatory environment in Rwanda—to ensure that its interventions are efficiently implemented and cost effective.

- **Quote:** Other countries: GiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote reveals that GiveDirectly evaluates location-specific conditions and cost structures, choosing to focus on regions where it already has established operations to maintain cost efficiency, rather than expanding to new countries with potentially higher operational costs.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how the charity has tailored its intervention delivery to local conditions by leveraging Kenya’s widespread mobile money infrastructure, which minimizes transfer costs and enhances operational cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that the charity uses a location-specific indicator—households with thatch roofs—to target those in need, adapting its intervention based on local housing conditions to ensure that funds are directed cost-effectively.


### Site visit_2012.md - important to read
- **Quote:** 1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly indicates that the charity selects intervention areas based on location-specific data (health indicators and water source characteristics), showing that the charity adapts its strategy to the local context in order to focus resources where they can be most cost-effective.

- **Quote:** 6. **Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source:** the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how the charity operationalizes location-specific adaptations by establishing clear, context-dependent criteria for selecting water points. By considering factors like water quality, household reach, and operational reliability, the charity aims to implement interventions in settings where they are most likely to be effective and cost-efficient.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote reveals a learning and adaptation process where feedback on suboptimal dispenser placement (a location-specific challenge) led to revised installation guidelines. This adaptive response reflects the charity’s operational approach to refine interventions based on local conditions, thereby enhancing accessibility and cost effectiveness.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapts its intervention by organizing cash out days based on the local condition of a weak and illiquid agent network. By choosing a nearby location, they reduce transportation costs for recipients and improve cost effectiveness, directly addressing the research question.



## MalariaConsortium
### 2020 Charity Report_2.md - important to read
- **Quote:** We have supported Malawi and Kenya to develop their national integrated vector control strategies and insecticide resistance management plans, to guide evidence-based selection of appropriate interventions that are tailored to local epidemiological settings. We are currently supporting Burkina Faso and Ethiopia to develop their insecticide resistance management plans.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly demonstrates how the charity adapts its interventions by tailoring them to local epidemiological conditions. By designing location-specific strategies, the organization optimizes resource allocation and operational processes, a practice that can improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, we finalised the second universal net distribution for the country, with a balance of eight million nets, and continued to monitor their durability and compare this with the performance of a new kind of net, with an adjuvant chemical to enhance the effectiveness of the pyrethroid insecticide.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates an adaptive operational process where the charity is calibrating its intervention (net distribution) to local conditions by testing and comparing product performance. Such monitoring and assessment help ensure that the most effective and cost-efficient intervention is deployed, aligning with the research question.


### 2020 Charity Report.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Macro-planning typically begins around five months before the start of the annual SMC round. This involves agreeing campaign dates and modalities at the national and state levels, as well as discussing adaptations to the SMC intervention tools and guidelines.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that Malaria Consortium tailors its operational processes in advance by engaging national and state stakeholders to adapt intervention tools and guidelines in line with local conditions. Such calibration to local needs has the potential to optimize resource allocation and enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Burkina Faso, community distributors screen children for signs of malnutrition, which was also part of the training.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates a location-specific adaptation where the intervention is expanded to address local health challenges (e.g., malnutrition) alongside malaria prevention. By integrating additional health screening into their operations, the charity better meets the needs of the community, potentially increasing overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Under the HBHI initiative's 'strategic information' response element, the PNLP conducted a stratification exercise with support from WHO, the Institute for Disease Modeling, and Northwestern University to determine the optimal mix of malaria interventions at the health district level. Based on the recommendations from this exercise, the PNLP decided to adopt five annual cycles of SMC from 2021 onwards in 19 of the country's 70 health districts, primarily in the south.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how data-driven calibration—tailoring the number of SMC cycles based on local epidemiological and seasonal patterns—enables the program to target interventions more effectively. Such location-specific adjustments likely enhance intervention impact while optimizing resource use, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** However, our procurement teams were able to rationalize procurement assumptions and secure reasonable prices, almost exclusively on national markets.

  **Reasoning:** This statement reflects an adaptation in the supply chain process where procurement strategies are adjusted based on local market conditions. By securing competitive pricing and reducing reliance on international markets, this strategy helps lower operational costs and contributes to the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.


### 2012-05-12 Interview Notes.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In some cases, for instance in one of our projects in Uganda, we do not work with other international organizations but we are working with local CBOs and the Ministry of Health through district level government health facilities. In this particular case we are also connecting the project with other Malaria Consortium funded projects to deliver greater impact. But generally we do always try to work in partnership, especially with the national government.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes to local contexts by partnering with local community-based organizations and government health facilities. Such calibration to location-specific needs likely enhances efficiency and impact, which can contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have two areas of value-added. First, we partner with the government or local actors where possible to ensure that there's a transfer of knowledge and ownership towards the end of the project. Second, we are rigorous in our use of monitoring and evaluation and research. We are not afraid of analyzing, reviewing, or establishing whether our interventions work, or how they could have been done better. We aim to establish best practices. As an organization we aim to try innovative approaches in things like mass net distribution. We ask questions such as: "Have people received the nets? Have they used the nets? If not, what stopped them? Do they not have the tools to hang them? Which tools are they lacking?" We drill down as much as we can.

  **Reasoning:** This section demonstrates that the organization systematically investigates local challenges—such as barriers to net usage—and adapts its intervention strategies accordingly. Although cost-effectiveness is not explicitly mentioned, the focus on rigorous evaluation and iterative improvement implies that tailoring interventions to actual, location-specific needs can optimize resource use and outcome effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Where the inSCALE project comes in is by looking at the attrition rate of trained health workers and looking at what could be done to keep them in post. What motivates or demotivates them? What support do they want/need? The project then pilots a range of solutions to see what works and once the evidence is in place that certain solutions are proving successful, we look at how that can be rolled out and scaled up with government support.

  **Reasoning:** This quote captures how the charity pilots various solutions based on localized evidence (such as health worker retention factors) and then scales up effective strategies with government support. This adaptive approach reflects a process of calibrating interventions to meet contextual needs, a strategy that can ultimately improve cost-effectiveness by focusing resources on what works.


### 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Adjustments to implementation guides to accommodate mobile populations, including pre-planning for the set-up of mobile fixed distribution sites.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how Malaria Consortium adapts its operational processes to local needs by modifying implementation guides based on the mobility of the population. It shows a clear calibration of interventions to suit location-specific conditions.

- **Quote:** Synchronization of the implementation phase across multiple districts and international borders to limit incentives for movement of individuals to access SMC services.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment wherein the implementation timing is coordinated across regions. By doing so, the charity aims to reduce unnecessary movement and duplication of effort, a strategy that can enhance efficiency and contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Mapping of, and pre-engagement with, established migrant populations (such as pastoralists) through existing umbrella associations to ascertain established routes in order to provide mobile fixed point delivery locations to cater to the needs of these individuals.

  **Reasoning:** This evidence shows that Malaria Consortium uses detailed local knowledge to tailor its delivery strategy for migrant groups. By calibrating intervention locations based on mapping and engagement with specific populations, the charity is optimizing resource allocation which likely supports cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium is exploring these ideas while trying to find ways to keep costs manageable. It is considering testing these methods on a small scale during the next transmission season, but has not yet begun doing so.

  **Reasoning:** Although this quote does not directly detail calibration for location-specific needs, it highlights an explicit effort to manage and reduce costs. This indicates an awareness that adapting operational processes can contribute to improved cost-effectiveness.


### 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium expected to focus on Nigeria, Uganda, and possibly Mozambique. These countries were chosen based on their high malaria burdens, the likelihood of their peak malaria transmission seasons overlapping with COVID-19 transmission, their LLIN campaign timelines, and the significant staff presence Malaria Consortium has in these countries.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how the charity adapts its operational processes by selecting intervention locations based on specific local conditions, such as high malaria burden, transmission season overlaps, and existing staff presence. These criteria indicate a targeted, location-specific calibration of interventions that can lead to enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium had already established local offices and relationships with the Ministries of Health in these countries, which could position it to implement LLIN campaigns in underserved regions if funding gaps were found.

  **Reasoning:** This quote underscores the organization’s use of pre-existing local infrastructure and partnerships to tailor its intervention strategies to the unique needs of each region. Leveraging local offices is an operational adaptation that facilitates efficient implementation and contributes to the overall cost-effectiveness of the intervention.


### 2021 GiveWell Summary.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that the charity tailors its operational processes by first performing a detailed pre-intervention assessment of local conditions. By evaluating factors such as malaria burden, transmission patterns, and rainfall, the organization ensures that SMC is deployed in areas where it is most needed, thereby enhancing the intervention’s cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium also conducts operational research to assess the feasibility and impact of modifying the procedures described above, such as adding a fifth SMC cycle or extending eligibility to children aged 5-10 years.

  **Reasoning:** This statement shows that the charity actively refines its intervention protocols based on ongoing local research. By exploring modifications like adjusting the number of treatment cycles or the target age group, the charity calibrates its operations to meet location-specific needs, which can optimize resource use and improve overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that CDs are typically paid about $5 to $7 per day for programs such as SMC, though this amount varies by country.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the charity adapts its operational practices to local economic contexts by varying compensation for community distributors (CDs) according to country-specific conditions. Such localized adjustments help control costs while ensuring effective program delivery, thereby contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.


### 2021 Info on Intervention.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In order to apply the findings from Cisse et al. 2016 to Malaria Consortium programs, we adjust for major differences between Cisse et al. 2016's intervention and context versus Malaria Consortium's. Two factors make us believe that the indirect effects in Malaria Consortium programs are likely to be about a third as large as Cisse et al. 2016: The typical Malaria Consortium program treats children between the ages of 3 months and 5 years old (rather than children aged 3 months to 10 years, as in Cisse et al. 2016).

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveWell adapts the intervention by calibrating it to local operational parameters—in this case, the age group targeted—which is a key example of customizing the program to meet location-specific needs. This calibration is directly factored into the cost-effectiveness analysis, showing the link between operational adaptation and overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have included an adjustment in our cost-effectiveness analysis to account for differences in coverage between the RCTs and Malaria Consortium's program.

  **Reasoning:** This statement demonstrates that the charity’s process involves modifying their cost-effectiveness model to reflect variations in on-the-ground coverage. It shows how operational differences, influenced by location-specific factors, are calibrated and incorporated into their assessment of cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We reviewed the individual studies in the Cochrane Collaboration review and removed one (Dicko et al. 2008) because it delivered treatments bi-monthly rather than monthly.

  **Reasoning:** By excluding a study that did not align with the specific monthly treatment protocol of the Malaria Consortium program, this quote evidences a deliberate adaptation of the evaluative process to ensure that only contextually relevant and comparable operational practices are considered, which supports more accurate cost-effectiveness estimates.
