- **Quote:** Are large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?
  
  Location: Lamwo District, Uganda
  
  Overview: Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how GiveDirectly adapted its intervention to the unique challenges of remote areas by leveraging mobile money technology, which enabled safe, secure, and efficient delivery. Such adaptations address operational challenges that are intrinsic to the location and imply potential cost savings, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Cash transfers and disaster response
  
  Location: Houston, USA and Puerto Rico
  
  Overview: Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them. The diversity of needs translated to a wide range of reported benefits.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an adaptation of charitable interventions tailored to a disaster-impacted location. By delivering cash transfers in a manner that meets the diverse needs of affected residents, the program demonstrates operational efficiency and flexibility that are essential for cost effectiveness in a challenging context.

- **Quote:** Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an adaptation of organizational processes based on geographic and local operational conditions. By relocating functions to a different area (Kampala) than where field operations occur, GiveDirectly aims to reduce conflicts of interest and fraud. This strategic adjustment tailored to local settings indirectly bolsters cost effectiveness by minimizing losses and improving oversight.

- **Quote:** Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides a clear example of adapting the intervention to local infrastructure. By shifting from EZEE Money to MTN Mobile Money, GiveDirectly responds to the limitations of the local agent network. This customization improves accessibility for recipients and can enhance overall operational efficiency and cost effectiveness in fund transfers.

- **Quote:** The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly tailors its targeting criteria to a location’s specific characteristics—in this case, using housing indicators that are locally relevant. By adapting the intervention (i.e., modifying the poverty proxy) to the context of Homa Bay County, the organization can more effectively identify the neediest households, which is central to ensuring cost-effectiveness in resource allocation.

- **Quote:** Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.
  
  GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed.

  **Reasoning:** This passage shows how GiveDirectly adapts the monetary component of its intervention to local economic conditions. By adjusting transfer amounts in response to inflation in Kenya, the organization maintains the real value of its aid, which protects and enhances its cost-effectiveness by ensuring that funds deliver consistent impact despite changing local price levels.

- **Quote:** Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an adaptation in the delivery method based on local infrastructural realities. By reassessing and modifying the cashout model in Uganda to better align with the local context, GiveDirectly aims to overcome logistical challenges, which can lead to improved operational efficiency and, ultimately, enhanced cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention protocols—by changing how funds are disbursed and by altering targeting criteria—to potentially better match local conditions. Although it does not explicitly state that these adaptations improve cost effectiveness, tailoring interventions to local realities is a strategy that could reduce inefficiencies and thereby contribute to better overall cost outcomes.

- **Quote:** Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly's program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is actively evaluating its program tradeoffs through a cost benefit analysis. While the statement does not directly link location-specific adaptations to cost effectiveness, it suggests that the organization is examining how changes (which may include adaptations to local characteristics) affect overall efficiency and cost structure.

- **Quote:** Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly is adapting its intervention to the specific local condition of lacking mobile-payment infrastructure. By using alternative methods—such as mobilizing external mobile-money agents and community members—it demonstrates a strategy aimed at lowering operational costs, thereby potentially enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also believes that the experiment will still be policy relevant even to budget-constrained country governments, as there are many potential variations that would be feasible (e.g., versions targeted to particular regions).

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is considering adapting its basic income guarantee experiment to different regional contexts. Tailoring interventions to particular regions suggests that adjustments based on local characteristics can be made to suit budget limits, which may contribute to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Capacity-building in Rwanda: GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adapted its operations to local conditions in Rwanda – for instance by responding to strict regulatory requirements – which resulted in more efficient processes such as quicker registration and hiring. This adaptation to the local context can contribute to overall cost effectiveness by streamlining operations.

- **Quote:** There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote explicitly ties the decision to focus on existing operational locations to cost efficiency. By remaining in familiar locations with established infrastructure, GiveDirectly adapts its intervention strategy to the local context, thereby avoiding the high costs of launching operations in new regions and enhancing overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how the intervention is tailored to the local context by using a regionally relevant marker (thatched roofs) as an indicator of poverty. Such a location-specific targeting mechanism can reduce misallocation and administrative costs, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt demonstrates an adaptation to local technological infrastructure. Utilizing M-Pesa—a system widely used in Kenya—likely reduces distribution and transaction costs, which in turn enhances the intervention’s cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that the selection of intervention locations is based on local characteristics such as water access, disease prevalence, and population density, suggesting that adapting to these specific factors may optimize resource use and potentially enhance cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This explicit instruction to use local epidemiological and infrastructural data to select intervention areas indicates a tailored approach that can lead to better targeting of resources, thereby contributing to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose water points for dispensers. DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides detailed, location-specific criteria for selecting installation sites. By ensuring that the dispensers are placed only where they are likely to be effective, the program minimizes wasted expenditures and thus supports enhanced cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows how feedback from early implementations led to improved location-specific installation guidelines. Adjusting the placement based on local usage patterns likely improves uptake and program efficiency, which can further contribute to overall cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates how GiveDirectly adapted its intervention to local conditions by organizing cash out days near villages. By doing so, they addressed the local challenge of an underdeveloped agent network and reduced transportation costs, thereby contributing to increased cost effectiveness.
