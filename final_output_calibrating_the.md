- **Quote:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights how GiveDirectly addresses local operational challenges by adopting mobile money as an alternative delivery channel in remote areas, illustrating an operational adjustment based on local context aimed at ensuring efficient (and thus cost-effective) intervention delivery.

- **Quote:** Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families. An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria. It found that efficient cash-based response was feasible and recipients greatly valued the flexibility that cash afforded them. The diversity of needs translated to a wide range of reported benefits.

  **Reasoning:** This passage demonstrates that in disaster contexts, GiveDirectly tailors its operational process by leveraging the inherent flexibility of cash transfers to meet diverse, urgent local needs – an adjustment that contributes to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** This study will evaluate the impact of different cash transfers sizes ($250 to $750) on a broad range of outcome measures, for a broad range of recipients. Its findings will provide a benchmark against which the impacts of other potential development interventions in Malawi can be assessed. It will also test whether improving access to agricultural input markets increases the impact of cash transfers.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly is testing varied cash transfer amounts alongside local market interventions (improving access to agricultural input markets) in Malawi. This approach of integrating local economic conditions into program design reflects an operational adjustment aimed at enhancing cost-effectiveness.


### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:
  
  * Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly's larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.
  * Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).
  * Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.
  * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.
  * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.

  **Reasoning:** This quote details a set of operational process adjustments implemented by GiveDirectly in Uganda in response to a fraud incident. By separating roles, increasing audits, conducting real-time checks, switching to a mobile money provider with better local coverage, and establishing local networks of informants, GiveDirectly tailors its intervention to address specific local challenges. Such adjustments help safeguard funds and improve process efficiency, which are key factors in achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly is considering a strategic operational adjustment by potentially serving as its own payment provider in Uganda. This experimental approach reflects an adaptation to local contexts and operational needs, suggesting that tailoring charity interventions based on local conditions may lead to more efficient and cost-effective service delivery.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where GiveDirectly adjusts its intervention (cash transfer amounts) based on local economic conditions (Kenya’s inflation). By indexing transfer amounts to inflation through regular reviews, GiveDirectly ensures that the value delivered to recipients remains effective, which in turn supports the charity's overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there.
  
  The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.

  **Reasoning:** This passage details how GiveDirectly employs a budgeting process to set efficiency targets tailored to the specific local context (e.g., higher costs in Uganda). This process of aligning operational budgeting and staffing with local cost structures is key to ensuring that a greater portion of each donated dollar reaches beneficiaries, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.


### Conversation with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly's program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote from Mr. Skeates’ work plan indicates that GiveDirectly is explicitly evaluating its operational processes through a cost benefit analysis. Such analysis is central to achieving cost-effectiveness, as it involves examining tradeoffs and cutting costs—a key component of the research question.

- **Quote:** Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly is adapting its operational processes by modifying its intervention protocols—specifically through altering cash out procedures and targeting criteria. These adjustments suggest a tailoring of charity interventions to potentially fit local contexts, which is an integral part of achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights an operational process adjustment in response to local conditions by involving community members. Incorporating local monitors helps mitigate risks (such as fraud) and fine-tunes the intervention to the local context, indirectly supporting cost-effectiveness by safeguarding resources.


### Paul_Niehaus_Ian_Bassin_Carolina_Toth_02-23-16_(public).md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:
  
  * **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.
  * **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly.** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.

  **Reasoning:** This passage directly illustrates how GiveDirectly is experimenting with different operational methods tailored to specific local contexts—such as areas without robust mobile-payment infrastructure—and streamlining interactions to reduce costs. The explicit mention of lowering costs and enabling faster enrollment shows the link between adjusting processes and achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates an operational adjustment made by GiveDirectly in response to local regulatory challenges. By reallocating resources from Uganda to Rwanda based on differences in operating environments, the organization is adapting its intervention to minimize risks and ensure that funds are used more effectively, which is a key aspect of achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This passage highlights how GiveDirectly refines its operational process by adjusting targeting criteria based on local feedback. By incorporating local insights—such as the identification of widows as vulnerable—the organization tailors its intervention to local needs, a strategy that can enhance the cost-effectiveness of its programs through better resource allocation.

- **Quote:** There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly tailors its intervention strategy based on local context by focusing on areas where it already has established operations, thereby minimizing the additional costs associated with expanding into new regions. This operational decision reflects an adjustment to local conditions that supports cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Capacity-building in Rwanda: GiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly adjusts its operational processes to accommodate the local regulatory and logistical context in Rwanda. By adapting their strategies (such as team hiring and registration processes) to local conditions, they enhance operational efficiency—a key component in achieving cost-effectiveness.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa. While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs. Please see our review of GiveDirectly for much more detail on GiveDirectly's program.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly’s operational process is tailored to the local context by leveraging a widely used mobile money system (M-Pesa) and employing a locally relevant poverty indicator (thatch roofs). Such context-specific targeting and technology use can enhance efficiency in fund distribution, reducing administrative costs and contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We have reviewed one RCT comparing physical cash transfers with electronic transfers to a recipient's cell phone. The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash. Had the study continued longer, the cheaper ongoing costs of the cell phone transfer mechanism would have made up for the higher initial costs. The study also finds that recipients of the cell phone transfer recipients had to walk less than 25% as far, on average, as those who received physical cash in order to 'cash out' their transfers (0.9 vs. 4.04 km).

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that by adjusting the method of cash delivery—shifting from physical cash to cell phone transfers—the intervention adapts to local logistical conditions (such as reducing travel distance for recipients). This operational adjustment reduces ongoing distribution costs and recipient burden, thereby supporting improved cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** 1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process where DSW selects intervention areas based on specific local data. By tailoring the selection of areas using local health and water source indicators, the charity likely improves the targeting of its resources, contributing to overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how DSW adapts its intervention based on local context. By employing strict, context-specific criteria for dispenser placement, the organization ensures that its resources are allocated efficiently to settings where the intervention is most likely to succeed, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of an iterative operational process. DSW used lessons learned from early pilots to adjust installation guidelines, ensuring that future placements are more accessible. Such adjustments based on local context feedback can improve usage rates and cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a process of fine-tuning operational strategies by testing different incentive models tailored to local performance metrics. Adjusting promoter incentives based on local uptake ensures that the intervention remains effective and resource-efficient, thereby supporting cost-effectiveness.


### Site visit_2014.md - important to read
- **Quote:** In Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process tailored to local conditions—specifically, the lack of a robust agent network—and explains how adjusting the intervention (by holding cash out days near the villages) reduces costs for recipients. This directly supports the research question on how operational adjustments can lead to cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Prior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates proactive operational planning where the charity ensures that local recipients are informed and that local mobile money agents are coordinated. Although not explicitly mentioning cost-effectiveness, such tailored coordination based on local context is a key step in achieving efficient, cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once.

  **Reasoning:** This quote evidences an adaptive operational process during the cash out day. By adjusting his approach in real time—grouping recipients by issue—Mr. Skeates improved the efficiency of addressing challenges, which is indicative of how operational adjustments to local context can streamline processes and contribute to cost-effectiveness.
