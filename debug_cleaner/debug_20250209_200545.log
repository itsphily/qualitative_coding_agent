Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Page Label Removal\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 1 ===\n\nWe\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively.

If this is the only time it appears, it should still be removed because the instructions specify removing all cookie notices.\n- All else is preserved.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Paragraph Separation and Reconstructed Sentences\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nOur mission is to prevent\nand treat neglected\ninfectious diseases\nthrough strengthening\nimpactful and comprehensive\nhealth programmes.\n\nWe\'ve achieved a lot\nsince our foundation\nin 2002.\nWe\'ve helped establish\nprogrammes against\nparasitic worm infections\nin countries where\nnone previously existed.\n\n**Expected Output:**\nOur mission is to prevent and treat neglected infectious diseases through strengthening impactful and comprehensive health programmes.\n\nWe\'ve achieved a lot since our foundation in 2002.\nWe\'ve helped establish programmes against parasitic worm infections in countries where none previously existed.\n\nExplanation:\n- The text broken across several lines is reconstructed into coherent sentences.\n- A blank line separates paragraphs.\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: Avoiding Summaries or Commentary\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 3 ===\nA conversation with Alan Fenwick and Najwa Al Abdallah, September 14, 2015\n\n## Participants\n\n* Alan Fenwick\n* Najwa Al Abdallah\n* Natalie Crispin\n* Tyler Heishman\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Professor Alan Fenwick and Najwa Al Abdallah of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) as part of its end-of-year update on SCI.\n\n**Incorrect Output (Summarized):**\nThe text is a conversation summary about SCI and funding.\n\n**Correct Output (Full Preservation):**\nA conversation with Alan Fenwick and Najwa Al Abdallah, September 14, 2015\n\n## Participants\n\n* Alan Fenwick\n* Najwa Al Abdallah\n* Natalie Crispin\n* Tyler Heishman\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Professor Alan Fenwick and Najwa Al Abdallah of the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) as part of its end-of-year update on SCI.\n\nExplanation:\n- No summarization or paraphrasing.\n- Original structure, headings, and bullet points are preserved.\n\n---\n\n### Example 4: Removing Redundant Cookie Banners\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nWe\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device...\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nWe\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device...\n\n**Expected Output:**\n(No text remains if the only content on these pages was a repeated cookie notice.)\n\nExplanation:\n- All repeated cookie banners are removed, as instructed.\n- If the text is strictly the same boilerplate, you do not retain it at all.\n\n---\n\n### Example 5: Handling a Broken Sentence\n\n**Input:**\n...we propose a novel approach to solve\nthe problem of finding the optimal solution\nto the problem of finding the optimal\nsolution to the problem\n...\n\n**Expected Output:**\n...we propose a novel approach to solve the problem of finding the optimal solution to the problem of finding the optimal solution to the problem...\n\nExplanation:\n- The partial sentence is reconstructed as best as possible.\n- Because it is unclear if additional text was lost, ellipses (...) are used at the start and end to indicate missing content.\n\n---\n\n### Example 6: Preserving Single Mentions of Contact Info\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 6 ===\n\nSCI Foundation\nEdinburgh House, 170 Kennington Lane, London, SE11 5DP\nRegistered company number 11775313 | Registered charity number 1182166\n\n**Expected Output:**\nSCI Foundation\nEdinburgh House, 170 Kennington Lane, London, SE11 5DP\nRegistered company number 11775313 | Registered charity number 1182166\n\nExplanation:\n- This contact info appears only once and is potentially relevant.\n- It is retained in the cleaned output.\n\n---\n\n### Example 7: Text has an obvious spelling or grammar mistake but must be left as-is\n**Input:**\n“We belive that health is improtant for all peple.”\n**Expected Output:**\n“We belive that health is improtant for all peple.”\n\nBy following these refined rules and examples meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\nHere is the text to be cleaned: \n<text to be cleaned>\n=== Page 1 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nResearch at GiveDirectly\n\nWe use rigorous experimental research (randomized controlled trials) to measure our impact and answer public policy questions. ## Experimental evaluations\n\nRigorous, experimental evaluation is rare among nonprofits. GiveDirectly collaborates with a wide range of leading independent researchers to measure the impacts of cash transfers and answer complex design questions through more than a dozen randomized controlled trials. We report the results of our evaluations and also announce studies in progress before the data are in, so that we can be held accountable for the results. We also run smaller, non-experimental tests to learn more about what works best and how different types of recipients spend funds they receive. ## Published randomized controlled trial studies\n\n### The impact of unconditional cash transfers on poor households in rural Kenya\n\n**Researchers:**: Johannes Haushofer (Princeton) and Jeremy Shapiro (Princeton) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n**Location:**: Siaya County, Kenya\n**Overview:**: The study documented large, positive impacts of cash transfers averaging ~$500 across a wide range of outcomes including assets, earnings, food security, psychological well-being, and domestic violence, an average four months after transfers ended. It also examined a number of design questions such as how to size transfers and whether to give them to men or women. A second endline survey >2 years after the end of transfers found "cash transfers result in sustained increases in assets. Long-term impacts on other dimensions, and potential spillover effects, remain to be substantiated by future work." **Registration:**: AEA registry entry. **Status:**: Peer-reviewed paper (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016); working papers published on psychological well-being for non-recipients (2019), domestic violence (2019), nutrition poverty traps\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nPsychological wellbeing for non-recipients: Vox; Second endline: GiveDirectly, study authors, Berk Ozler, Justin Sandefur; Domestic violence: Fast Company. ## Benchmarking a traditional nutrition and WASH program to cash\n\n**Researchers:** Craig McIntosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Location:** Kayonza and Nyabihu districts, Rwanda\n\n**Overview:** The study explored the cost-effectiveness (impact per dollar) of unconditional cash transfers and of Gikuriro, an integrated nutrition program. It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study\'s primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey. For secondary outcomes studied, the smaller cash transfer program decreased debt and increased assets, while the nutrition program increased savings. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. **Status:** Working paper and IPA policy brief published in 2018\n\n**Media and blogs:** Washington Post, New York Times, Vox, Quartz, NPR, Wired, Center for Global Development, GiveDirectly, study authors, Berk Ozler, Jason Kerwin, Non-Profit Chronicles, Chicago Policy Review, Lee Crawford\n\n## Transfers to coffee-farming communities\n\n**Researchers:** Ilinsight and GiveDirectly\n\n**Location:** Iganga district, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** The study evaluated the impact of $1,000 cash transfers to Ugandan communities where coffee-farming is common. It found that consumption, assets, food security, and earnings all increased for both coffee farmers and households that don\'t produce coffee. Coffee farmers increased their investment in coffee farming, as well as in other livelihoods. **Study registration:** RIDIE registry.entry. === Page 3 ===\n\n## GiveDirectly\n\n### Using cash transfers to benchmark the cost-effectiveness of a youth workforce readiness program\n\n**Researchers:** Craig Mcintosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Overview:** This study benchmarked the impact of a youth employment education intervention to cash transfers in the Rwandan context. It found that both programs increased productive hours, assets, savings, and subjective well-being. Only youth training improved business knowledge, and only cash transfers improved consumption, income, and wealth. When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), "cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge". The study found little evidence that combining cash with training improved cost-effectiveness, compared to delivering cash on its own. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. **Status:** Working paper published in 2020, second endline planned for early 2021\n\n**Media and blogs:** [Blog] What we\'ve learned by comparing cash to job training\n\n### How do cash transfers impact local economies? **Researchers:** Dennis Egger (UC Berkeley), Johannes Haushofer (Princeton), Ted Miguel (UC Berkeley), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Walker (UC Berkeley), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action. **Location:** Siaya County, Kenya\n\n**Overview:** This study found that the consumption expenditure and income increased for both people who received cash, and those who did not. Over the course of 27 months, the total economic impact of a $1,000 transfer was approximately $2,600 (a fiscal multiplier of about 2.6) when impacts for recipients and non-recipients are combined. There were also gains in psychological wellbeing, food security, education and security for recipients, and no significant negative impacts were recorded for non-recipients. Delivering over 15% of local GDP in cash transfers only increased prices by 0.1% on average. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. === Page 4 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\n**Media and blogs:**Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, Vox, World Economic Forum, CBS Bay Area, GiveDirectly, The Life You Can Save, Behavioral Scientist, Michael Walker (taxation findings), _Econimate_\n\n**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**\n\n**Researchers:**Abhijit Banerjee (MIT), Tavneet Suri, (MIT), Alan Krueger (Princeton), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Faye (GiveDirectly), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Location:**Siaya and Bomet counties, Kenya\n\n**Overview:**The largest study of UBI to date will explore the impact of a long term basic income (12 years of monthly payments equivalent to $0.75 per day), a short term basic income (2 years at $0.75 per day) and a lump sum equivalent to the total value short term basic income.

This study will explore three core research questions: (1) What is the impact of $1,000 cash transfers on refugee households for outcomes such as income, assets, consumption, enterprise, food security and psychological well-being? (2) What do any changes caused by the cash transfers mean for the lives of refugee households and how did those changes come about? (3) What is the effect of cash transfers on host communities, and their relationship with the refugee communities? **Study registration:** Registration pending\n\n**Status:** Research ethics clearance secured, baseline survey due to launch Q4 2019\n\n## Non-experimental evaluations at GiveDirectly\n\nAside from the rigorous randomized control trials described above, we also implement a number of non-experimental projects to learn more about what\'s feasible, what recipients prefer, or how different types of recipients spend funds they receive differently. ## Are large cash transfers to refugees and host communities feasible? **Location:** Kyaka II refugee settlement and surrounding communities, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** This evaluation comprised recipient surveys and focus group discussions to evaluate the feasibility, reported spending and indicative impact of $660 lump sum cash transfers to long term refugees and host community households. Recipients reported wide-ranging positive impacts soon after receiving and spending their transfers. === Page 8 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nAre large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible? **Location:** Lamwo District, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting. **Status:** Project complete and report published\n\n**Blogs:** GiveDirectly. **Cash transfers and disaster response**\n\n**Location:** Houston, USA and Puerto Rico\n\n**Overview:** Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

We owe it to each other - and our donors - to instill this confidence even though giving and receiving information candidly are unusual in both professional and social life, and can be very uncomfortable. ## 4 Create positive energy. _We strive to be a source - not drain - of energy for our colleagues._\n\nOur work is hard, practically and emotionally, and we cannot overemphasize the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, enjoying the company of our colleagues, and not taking ourselves too seriously. In doing so, we require answers and excitement amongst our colleagues in meeting. === Page 2 ===\n\n## 5. Think rigorously; act quickly. _We are intellectually rigorous with a drive towards action - not debate._\n\nWe reason from first principles, grounding our decisions in objective claims about the world, rather than hard-to-disprove assertions or hierarchy. We aim to brainstorm inclusively and respectfully, but critically self-vet ideas we put forward, so as to ensure productive and prudent decision making. Demanding this level of rigor forces us to think harder about decisions and our assumptions than we otherwise might. This is a real cost. It can be taken too far: it is possible to overthink decisions, and we avoid debate for the sake of debate. We are not here to philosophize or ensure consensus. We decide and act quickly, avoiding getting bogged down in debates. ## 6. Know yourself and grow. _We recognize and accept our imperfections with a focus on growth._\n\nWe are an organization of exceptional people and trust in each other\'s abilities, yet we recognize that none of us is perfect. We strive to maintain an accurate understanding of our individual and institutional strengths and weaknesses, in order to position ourselves to maximize our chances of success. At the same time, we seek personal growth for ourselves and our teammates. Feedback is given with a spirit of helpfulness; and sought out with a desire to learn. ## 7. Accept reality. Propose solutions. _We do not dwell on problems. We work actively to create solutions._\n\nThere will always be an endless list of things to improve. We focus on the things that can be changed; find the most important of those things, and propose actionable answers. We do not allow "problems" to weigh us down and be a source of negativity. We are forward looking, which we believe not only leads to better team outcomes, but also creates a more enjoyable, energizing environment for all. ## 8. Be productively ambitious. _We take the risks to pursue industry-changing success, not incremental progress._\n\nWe seek step-change improvements at all levels, and are willing to make big-bets; we do not accept complacency nor do we simply optimize existing processes. In doing so, we allow ourselves to dream big with a belief that perceived constraints are merely opportunities for creativity. === Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nSign up and stay informed about:\n\nStories from recipients\n\nExclusive event invites\n\nResearch updates\n\nTAKE ACTION\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\nTax EIN: 27-1661997\n\nContact Us\n\nPress Inquiries\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n# GiveDirectly\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

This study could use the same control-group villages as the GE study. ### Segovia\n\nSegovia, a new for-profit company started by GiveDirectly board member Michael Faye, with the involvement of Dr. Niehaus and GiveDirectly board member Chris Hughes, has been incorporated, received a convertible note, and will be working on Series A financing over the next few months. The team, headed by Mr. Faye, consists of:\n\n* A chief of staff\n* A Vice President of engineering\n* Two full-time engineers\n* A full-time designer\n* A part-time employee in a product role\n\nSegovia's engineering team is currently working exclusively on GiveDirectly deployment. Mr. Faye and Dr. Niehaus are currently seeking Segovia's first non-GiveDirectly paying client. Segovia is not currently designed to implement programs. In the future, it may be able to offer technical assistance or implementation services. If both GiveDirectly and Segovia were offering these services, GiveDirectly would likely be more selective about the type of projects it undertakes, while Segovia would be willing to implement projects that are not designed in a way that GiveDirectly would consider optimal. Dr. Niehaus would step out of board decisions determining whether GiveDirectly should take a certain project. Segovia talks to GiveDirectly staff members Piali Mukhopadhyay, Joe Huston, and Stuart Skeates once per week, and Caroline Toth daily. Dr. Niehaus has been spending about 5-10% of his time on Segovia, which is slightly less than he had expected to spend during the past months. ### New board members\n\nGiveDirectly recently added two new board members:\n\n* Jacquelline Fuller, Director\n* Bill Meehan, Director\n\n=== Page 7 ===\n\nIt was important for GiveDirectly to find new board members who are closely aligned with GiveDirectly's vision, because decisions will likely arise for which board members who have roles at Segovia will have to step out. ### The Rarieda Randomized Control Trial (RCT)\n\nThe Rarieda RCT, which included both a $300 transfer treatment group and a $1000 transfer treatment group, did not provide strong evidence on what the best transfer size would be, because it is difficult to assess the relative value of how people use the 1000th dollar versus the 300th. There are also large confidence intervals around any of the findings based on sub-groups because of the relatively small sample size. Dr. Niehaus thinks it is unlikely $1000 is exactly the optimal size for transfers, but expects returns to be relatively flat around the $1000 mark, and so feels the costs to slight variance from the optimal transfer size are low. GiveDirectly has considered experimenting with different transfer sizes to determine the optimal amount, but feels that other research questions are more important. GiveDirectly is not concerned that recipients will run out of good ways to spend $1000 in transfer funds (e.g., purchasing an iron roof, a cow, and paying school fees for a year will use up most of a transfer). GiveDirectly also believes that while testing transfer sizes could improve its own program, it would be unlikely to affect other cash transfer programs. For example, if a government was considering providing large, one-time transfers, it would not be as concerned with whether $1000 is the right amount, but rather whether the model of large, one-time grants is effective. GiveDirectly prefers to pursue research questions that it sees as likely to influence public policy quickly (e.g., giving people control over the timing of their transfers). GiveDirectly sees the question of optimal transfer size as one that would require rigorous research to learn about, so it is not inclined to simply vary the size of its transfers as an informal experiment. It is widely accepted that periodic income transfers can reduce human suffering, but it is much less accepted that large one-time transfers can be effective ways of investing in people. There is less literature on the latter, and therefore more to be gained from researching it. Dr. Niehaus believes that some people mistakenly believe that in-kind transfers of low value can significantly change a poor person's life, when in fact it requires significant investment to lift someone out of poverty. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document.

Cash transfers are still a controversial intervention, and disagreement is emerging within the field of humanitarian policy over the degree to which they should be used. People who are invested in maintaining the status quo in international development are likely to push back against cash transfers. ### Institutional partnerships and policy work\n\n#### Impact of partnerships and policy work on GiveDirectly's core activities\n\nGiveDirectly is engaging in or considering a number of partnerships that would involve implementing cash transfers, and also could have policy impact. Attempting to affect policy change is very high-risk, but potentially also very high-reward. It is also much harder to measure the impact of this work than the impact of a direct cash transfer. GiveDirectly does not believe its policy work is significantly different from its traditional cash transfer campaigns. In its standard activities, GiveDirectly will make decisions about who gets transfers and how recipients are randomized. When GiveDirectly is attempting to affect policy, these decisions are still made, but with explicit policy impact in mind. From this perspective, policy decisions are an extra input that precedes the execution of a project, in order to ensure that the direct action of transferring cash has the greatest possible impact. === Page 2 ===\n\nRegardless of its policy work, GiveDirectly intends to maintain its current level of cost-effectiveness by delivering 90 or 91 cents of each donated dollar directly to transfer recipients, which remains the minimum impact of the organization's activities. An indirect effect of increased funding for GiveDirectly's cash transfer programming, as well as increased positive media coverage, has been an increase in resources for GiveDirectly to invest in policy work. #### Funding structure\n\nFor any large institutional partnership, GiveDirectly pursues a 50/50 split of the costs--GiveDirectly or GiveDirectly's funders contributing money to the project increases the probability that a large institutional funder would contribute as well. #### Allocation of time by GiveDirectly management\n\nMs. Toth estimates that Dr. Niehaus spends no more than 50% of his time on institutional partnerships and believes that this is the area of GiveDirectly's work where the marginal value of his time is currently highest. Progress on partnerships with large organizations tends to be slow, as they require approvals from several people. #### Criteria for participation in partnerships\n\nTo decide whether to participate in a collaborative project, GiveDirectly must weigh benefits against costs. Many partnerships would incur fixed costs of moving to a new location or finding logistical solutions in a new area, as well as other risks and uncertainties. Potential benefits could be changing policy or changing mindset among a group of people. In particular, GiveDirectly considers the counterfactual question of what might happen if it decided not to pursue the project. For example, in one potential partnership that GiveDirectly ultimately decided not to pursue, the planned study already included a cash transfer arm as a benchmark, and GiveDirectly felt that it would add little value by acting as the implementing partner. GiveDirectly decided to limit its role to providing advice on how to design the transfers. Another partnership GiveDirectly explored was working with two large multilateral organizations to set up a comparison between cash transfers and cows in one country. GiveDirectly believed that while the potential for impact on government policy and recipient outcomes was high, the risks of moving into an unfamiliar area and using unfamiliar payment systems were too great. It was also unclear whether a large enough sample could be assembled for the cash transfer arm to constitute a scientifically credible study. #### Work with DFID\n\nDFID invited members of GiveDirectly's board to participate in a panel discussion about the role of cash transfers in humanitarian aid. However, it is hard to predict what kind of impact on policy might result from the panel's findings. === Page 3 ===\n\n### Benchmarking initiative\n\nGiveDirectly has had conversations with a non-profit that runs evaluations of aid programs about how to promote more head-to-head comparisons between cash transfers and other interventions. An informal poll among lead researchers of the non-profit's ongoing studies indicated a high level of interest in incorporating cash transfer arms. GiveDirectly likely would not undertake the work of setting up cash arms for studies due to the high costs involved, but in many places there are in-country implementing partners that could execute a cash transfer arm if they had the necessary funding. GiveDirectly would like to learn whether grantmaking organizations would be interested in funding the addition of cash transfer arms to studies. However, it would not itself fund other organizations to do this. GiveDirectly intentionally does not regrant to other organizations because the process of evaluating sub-grantees would require a huge investment of resources that GiveDirectly is not currently willing to dedicate and that would reduce efficiency. ### Financial updates\n\n#### Room for more funding\n\n##### Field directors' cash transfer capacity\n\nGiveDirectly believes that its field directors in Kenya and Uganda will each have a cash transfer capacity of $17.25 million in budget year 2016 (this does not include January and February of 2016, which belong to budget year 2015). GiveDirectly is hiring a flexible field director (i.e., one who works on a variety of projects in multiple countries), Eric Friedman, who will start at the end of September. ##### Future hiring opportunities\n\nHiring new field directors would not be a challenge for GiveDirectly. If it had more funds to distribute via cash transfers, it would hire more field directors and thus raise its capacity significantly. GiveDirectly's COO, Piali Mukhopadhyay, has the capacity to manage five field directors. Hiring more junior staff also presents no obstacles, as unemployment in the countries where GiveDirectly works is high. Hiring for these positions might take a month or two of the field directors' time. ##### Projected use of Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly now has $25 million from Good Ventures, as well as some funds raised in the last couple of months, in unbudgeted funds. GiveDirectly would like to fully explore the possibility of finding matching funds for the Good Ventures grant before committing the Good Ventures funds to cash transfers. Once GiveDirectly has a better sense of the likelihood of securing matching funds and the pros and cons of such an arrangement, it will start to consider using the Good Ventures funding unmatched. It is possible, but somewhat unlikely, that GiveDirectly will find a large\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nscale matching partnership very quickly. A more realistic outcome is that the search for a matching donor will extend through 2016 and beyond, which means that GiveDirectly would not use any of the Good Ventures funding in 2016. ### Effect of inflation on transfer sizes\n\n#### Background\n\nA few years ago, Kenya experienced a very sharp rise in inflation (25-30% in 2011), which reduced the value of the transfers GiveDirectly distributed. Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. #### Adjusting transfer sizes for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed. In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900. #### Reasons for delay on adjusting for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly was aware of the inflation problem in 2011, but did not address the issue at the time. GiveDirectly also mistakenly thought the rate of inflation would be about 2-5%, which was much less than the actual rate. In addition, in 2011, all of GiveDirectly's programs were operating on the stop-start model, so there was more uncertainty around the future of its programs and less focus on long-term trends. The current rolling model in Kenya has brought a shift in mentality, which helped lead to the decision to adjust for inflation. #### Policy on foreign bank holdings\n\nTo protect against foreign exchange risk, GiveDirectly's policy is to only hold funds within a country if they have been committed to transfers; other budgeted liabilities are currently retained in U.S. bank accounts. However, GiveDirectly is now debating whether to increase the amount it holds in foreign currency to an amount equal to a six-month budget. This would provide a hedge against foreign exchange risk and\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nsome protection against deflation or inflation, but it would also result in greater bank risk. A six-month budget for GiveDirectly is currently $10-15 million, which is a large sum to entrust to a foreign bank, and GiveDirectly does not yet have an adequate understanding of Kenyan bank risk to make this decision. #### Setting efficiency targets for each campaign\n\nIn the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers. ### Program updates\n\n#### Uganda\n\n#### Funding for October 2015-February 2016 campaign\n\nGiveDirectly plans to begin enrolling recipients for a discrete campaign in Uganda in October and November 2015. The $4.5 million GiveDirectly currently has is enough to fund enrollment through February 2016; for any enrollments beyond that, more funding would be required. If GiveDirectly has enough funding to transition Uganda to a rolling model, it will incorporate the discrete campaign into a rolling campaign. If it does not get enough funding, it will end its program in Uganda, though GiveDirectly considers this an unlikely outcome. #### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs.\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly\'s Ugandan program, GiveDirectly\'s capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members. GiveDirectly prepared a written update to accompany this conversation, which is available here:\n\nhttp://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/20140904%20GD%20-%20GV%20check%20in.pdf\n\n## Ugandan fraud case\n\n### Nature of the fraud\n\nThere were three key people involved in the fraud:\n\n* GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process\n* GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls\n* Agents from the mobile money providers\n\nThe fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays. === Page 2 ===\n\n## Discovery of the fraud\n\n1. A GiveDirectly recipient had given their SIM card to the SFO (whose contract had been terminated in April due to an unrelated issue involving a fraudulent receipt he brought to GiveDirectly for reimbursement). The recipient asked the SFO to replace his SIM card (recipients have to travel about 4 hours round trip to get this done) and the SFO had not returned it. This report was made to the hotline that the OM was answering three months after the recipient had given over their SIM card. Mr. Skeates audits the logs of these hotline calls. 2. GiveDirectly had been planning a full round of follow-up surveys as part of its normal process, but accelerated the follow-up surveys in response to this issue. GiveDirectly\'s backcheck team paused their work on enrollment for the Uganda 2M campaign and called all the recipients in that village (Kosile) to ask whether they had received all of their transfers, had any problems withdrawing, and whether GiveDirectly currently had any of their documents (e.g., SIM cards, IDs). 3. During this process, there were some reports of problems during paydays. Recipients were initially hesitant to come forward. 4. Because of the reports of payday problems, GiveDirectly began calling another village, Kawo, the following day to gather more information. Recipients in Kawo were far more forthcoming with information when asked specific questions about payday problems. 5. GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO\'s and OM\'s dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages. Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud:\n\n* Because GiveDirectly\'s Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage. * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not. ## GiveDirectly\'s reaction to the fraud\n\nAt the time of the fraud\'s discovery, GiveDirectly had recently finished registering a new, $2 million cohort for the Uganda 2M campaign. The fraud occurred during the final round of payments in the previous campaign. Consequently, the fraud did not significantly affect GiveDirectly\'s capacity to move money in Uganda. The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans. === Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly filed an initial police report and gave transfer recipients the option of submitting testimonies to police. (GiveDirectly left this optional because it did not want to give the police a list of its recipients.) GiveDirectly is waiting to see what the Ugandan police will be able to do before deciding whether to reimburse recipients who had money stolen, in order to avoid having recipients doubly reimbursed by both the police and by GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:\n\n* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly\'s larger network in Kenya is already structured this way. * Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month). * Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts. * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer. * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case. GiveDirectly currently has five Senior Field Officers (SFOs) in Kenya and one in Uganda. A Field Officer in Uganda was promoted to SFO to replace the SFO involved in the fraud, and an interim SFO was brought in from Kenya to work in Uganda for one month to help the Ugandan team recover. SFOs report directly to the Field Director. There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly\'s process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks). The payment agency is conducting its own disciplinary process. GiveDirectly will not be working with the payment agent involved in the fraud again. Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly\'s Chief Operating Officer, International, has suggested having cameras present to take pictures as people receive their transfers. Segovia\'s work will enable better fraud detection and greater data transparency, which will be especially important as GiveDirectly\'s scale increases. Other instances of fraud GiveDirectly has experienced include:\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n* Isolated incidents of M-Pesa agents asking for bribes or higher percentage fees for processing transactions. * Village Elders claiming to have brought GiveDirectly to their village or to have gotten a particular recipient on GiveDirectly\'s list and asking the recipient(s) for a gift in return. * There are likely some transfer recipients who are falsely claiming to live in structures that would make them eligible for GiveDirectly\'s program. ### Government approvals\n\nGiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government\'s requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government\'s formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly\'s work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly\'s recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly\'s work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it. GiveDirectly worked with a person in the office of the president in Nairobi who may be a useful contact for GiveDirectly in the future. GiveDirectly\'s work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly\'s agenda has no political or ethnic bias. ### Capacity to expand\n\nGiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program. GiveDirectly has worked in one and received approval to work in a second (Ugunja Division). It took 2.5 months to get this approval. Ugunja has room for about $3 million1 in transfer opportunities (given that half of the villages need to be set aside for controls in the general equilibrium study [see below]). Footnote 1: 83 non-control villages * 90 households/village * 40% eligibility * $1,000/household = $2,988,000. In Uganda, GiveDirectly renewed both national registration and Bukedea District-specific registration for one year. The amount GiveDirectly moves in that year will\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\ndepend more on fundraising than on approvals. Bukedea has room for about $23 million2 in transfer opportunities. It took about a month to get Bukedea approval. Footnote 2: 115 villages GiveDirectly has not been to * 200 eligible households/village * $1,000/household = $23,000,000. Currently, GiveDirectly is enrolling about $1 million-worth of new recipients per month. GiveDirectly is planning to meet with the governor of Kakamega, who is preparing to implement a $2 million Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program. There has recently been significant devolution in Kenya, and money previously controlled by the federal government has been given to county governors to allocate. This potentially creates opportunities for GiveDirectly to work with the government and offer advice on how to use these funds effectively. GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly\'s Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program. Cash transfers currently fund private goods. GiveDirectly is considering experimenting with a system whereby transfer recipients could propose public goods projects and individuals could pool their resources to fund projects they consider worthwhile. GiveDirectly has discussed this general idea with the Rockefeller Foundation. ## Research\n\n### General equilibrium (GE) long-term study\n\nThis long-term study is currently a major fundraising priority. GiveDirectly has raised $8 million in funding of a needed $15 million to maximize the research\'s impact. Ted Miguel (University of California) and Johannes Haushofer (Princeton University) will both serve as principal investigators for the study. Professor Miguel has done similar long-term research on de-worming. The study will be randomized at the village level and will focus on macro-level effects (e.g., changes in prices, new businesses created, etc.).\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\npossible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located. #### Kenya\n\n#### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly has nearly exhausted its ability to enroll households in Siaya County, although it would be possible to treat the control group in Siaya from the General Equilibrium (GE) study. The control households make up slightly less than half the eligible households in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly wants to maintain the Siaya control group as a control for long-term follow-up purposes, and it does not anticipate problems getting further approvals from the Kenyan government for work elsewhere. GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward. #### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison. In about two months, GiveDirectly expects to have more details about the study design and which program will be compared to cash transfers. In the future, GiveDirectly may invest its own funding in Rwanda for other cash transfer campaigns, but this depends largely on the total amount of funding it receives and on how GiveDirectly's work in Rwanda progresses. #### Modified criteria for eligibility\n\nThe presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed. === Page 7 ===\n\nGiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well. GiveDirectly has found that different groups of respondents give very different answers, or that the same respondents will give very different answers on multiple tests. ### Trustee and helper system\n\nTo help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipient whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs. A helper is a position of lower responsibility. Helpers may be chosen for recipients who are very old or blind. The transfer can thus be registered in the recipient's name, but the helper retrieves the transfer or assists the recipient in using the phone. ### Security risks\n\n#### Risk of targeting for robbery on cashout days\n\nLarge volumes of cash brought into villages on cashout days, making them a possible target for robbery. However, the banks or mobile money providers that GiveDirectly works with provide armored vehicles, security personnel, and valuable cash handling expertise for the cash out days. #### Risk due to increased prominence\n\nGiveDirectly does not anticipate increased risk of robbery as it becomes better known in the areas where it works. In Siaya in Kenya, GiveDirectly was extremely well known, so it seems unlikely that criminal activity in new areas where GiveDirectly is less recognized would be greater than it was in Siaya. However, likelihood of crime might vary from region to region. GiveDirectly does not consider security risk to be very high in Homa Bay County, but acknowledges that it could be more of a concern in an urban area. One of the benefits of the distributed cashout model is that it makes it easier to keep recipients' identities secret and therefore limit the potential for robbery. As part of its follow-up procedure, GiveDirectly asks recipients security-related questions,\n\n=== Page 8 ===\n\nsuch as whether anyone knows that they are recipients and knew when they went to cash out, to monitor security risk. _Policy on reimbursing stolen transfers_\n\nWhen theft of a transfer occurs that is out of GiveDirectly's control, GiveDirectly generally does not reimburse the recipient, although it will try to help recover the money by negotiating with the thief or involving the police or local government. ### Impact of research studies on GiveDirectly's activities\n\n#### Approach to incorporating research studies\n\nA large number of GiveDirectly's enrollees are now participants in one of several ongoing research studies. The model for some of these studies may be significantly different from GiveDirectly's regular campaigns (i.e., the transfer amounts may be higher or lower). When a study's model deviates significantly from the way GiveDirectly publicly presents its campaigns, GiveDirectly finds an independent source of funding and does not use any retail donations to finance the study. For example, one study was funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The ideas42 study, which also represented a substantial deviation from GiveDirectly's core model, was also independently funded. Examples of retail donation-funded research projects are the GE study and the forthcoming aspirations study, which both use the model described on GiveDirectly's website. GiveDirectly is now trying to include all of its recipients in either a study or a learning objective. Learning objectives are internal tests conducted by GiveDirectly in which the standard campaign model is slightly varies. GiveDirectly uses results from learning objective campaigns to gather information about how it might adjust its operating procedures (e.g., experimentation with proxy means tests). #### Research studies under rolling-campaign model\n\nThe rolling model is preferable in most ways to the discrete-campaign model. It allows GiveDirectly to employ people for longer than a few months at a time, and to operate more as an organization rather than a standalone project. Though it is not necessarily more difficult to incorporate a study into the rolling model, it does introduce some complexities. The rolling model places some pressure on academics to organize their studies in a way that fits into GiveDirectly's timeline. The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers. The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not\n\n=== Page 9 ===\n\nwant to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual. ### Operational updates\n\n#### Segovia platform\n\nGiveDirectly expects some efficiency gains from adopting Segovia, but no more than what could be expected from any upgrade in technology, such as an upgrade in finance software. GiveDirectly's chairman, Michael Faye, is the lead on Segovia, while Dr. Niehaus leads on GiveDirectly's work, and each provides occasional support to the other. Combined, the two of them dedicate the equivalent of two CEOs' hours to Segovia and GiveDirectly. #### US staffing\n\nTo help fill the general management position in its New York office, GiveDirectly has engaged a recruiter, which has supplied several candidates. Some of these are in late-stage conversations with GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has seen high interest in its open partnerships lead position, but identifying candidates with the right level of talent has been challenging. Recruiting for this role has been conducted mainly through networking. The candidates GiveDirectly has seen so far would likely take on more of a supporting role, assisting with analysis and strategy. GiveDirectly is also interested in a candidate who could explore more traditionally fundraising-oriented partnerships, such as corporate partnerships that could raise GiveDirectly's retail profile, as well as speak with family foundations and conduct more one-on-one discussions. Finding candidates for its open digital marketing and products position has also been a challenge, as quality talent in this field is in high demand. GiveDirectly's current management do not have many marketed-related contacts, but have started investigating personal networks more deeply. GiveDirectly has also enlisted another recruiter to help expand the pipeline of candidates. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Topics discussed in this conversation include Mr. Skeates\' previous work experience and future work responsibilities at GiveDirectly, changes implemented in response to the case of staff fraud in Uganda, and various issues that can compromise the success of GiveDirectly\'s work. ### About Stuart Skeates\n\nStuart Skeates is GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director. Prior to his role at GiveDirectly, Mr. Skeates was at McKinsey & Company, where he worked with the government of Ethiopia on energy and water projects. ### Mr. Skeates\' work plan in 2015\n\nAround early November 2014, Mr. Skeates will transition from working full time in Uganda as the Field Director to being based out of GiveDirectly\'s Kenya office. Mr. Skeates will still spend one week per month in Mbale, Uganda, to oversee the ongoing Uganda 2M campaign. In total, he expects to spend one third of his time on work specific to Uganda. The other two thirds of his time will be spent on miscellaneous projects, including:\n\n* Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly\'s program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs. * Assisting Joe Huston, GiveDirectly Kenya Field Director, with some of GiveDirectly\'s research projects. Mr. Skeates is planning to supervise data collection for the behavioral study. * Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households. * Helping with the deployment of Segovia technology. ### Changes implemented in response to staff fraud\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nIn the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:\n\n* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents. * Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents. * Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) for their time during a cash out day. * Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient\'s phone after the recipient passed away. * Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale. * Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly. * Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent\'s account. For more on the staff fraud, see this blog post that GiveDirectly published after our site visit: https://www.givedirectly.org/blog_post.php?id=6720123171950519215 (archived version available here: http://www.webcitation.org/6TwrteHbT). ## Issues\n\n### Security of phones and mobile money accounts\n\nSome recipients, especially elderly ones, have to learn how to use cell phones for the first time in order to manage the GiveDirectly transfers in mobile money accounts. These people have a more difficult time understanding how to keep their phones secure; for example, they often keep the phone in its original packaging and do not conceal it. Another problem with security is that some recipients will share the PIN numbers for their mobile money accounts, either intentionally or unintentionally by handing the phone to a mobile money agent before pressing "Send" (so the PIN number is still apparent on the screen of the phone.) This makes recipients more vulnerable to people who wanted to steal money from their accounts. Teaching PIN saftey has long been a priority, and GiveDirectly has added additional emphasis on the topic (e.g.,\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\nemphasis during village meetings, additional trainings given by the mobile provider) Improved security is a reason why GiveDirectly is interested in piloting biometric authentication for mobile money accounts, though it does not currently have plans to do so. ### Increased gaming\n\nOne village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there was also one village with high levels of gaming. GiveDirectly mentioned two possible contributing factors: 1) the village was close to another village that had already received transfers, so it is likely that there was a higher level of awareness of GiveDirectly\'s targeting criteria at the outset, enabling people to pose as meeting the criteria from the census stage; 2) evidence that a corrupt staff member planted a false recipient in the village. ### Theft\n\nThere are cases of theft from individual recipients. Most of the theft of transfers is happening from within villages, rather than external people coming to the villages to steal funds. ### Transfer size\n\nIn 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting. GiveDirectly has found a poverty rate in Homa Bay similar to that of Siaya and Rarieda. However, more people in Homa Bay have metal roofs than in Siaya. This is likely because the grass for thatched roofs does not grow in Homa Bay, so the price of thatch is less competitive. This may mean that Homa Bay residents spend a higher percentage of their income on housing. #### Return on investment (ROI) in Homa Bay\n\nBecause Homa Bay residents are less likely to spend their cash transfers on roofs, the ROI from these transfers may differ from that seen in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly is generally not focused on ROI. Its first randomized controlled trial measured a wide range of indicators (including mental health, education, child nutrition, and income), and it has not closely examined ROI. Studies of the Homa Bay program, such as the Aspirations study, will collect basic consumption data, which GiveDirectly will eventually be able to use. However, Ms. Toth is not sure whether the Aspirations study will include a specific measure of ROI. Because Homa Bay is very similar to Siaya geographically, GiveDirectly is not concerned that its level of impact in Homa Bay will be lower. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Conversation topics included GiveDirectly\'s goals for 2016, deprioritized areas of work, budget allocation, impact on charitable giving and development assistance, and operations updates. ## Goals for 2016\n\n### Doubling non-Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to approximately double the amount of non-Good Ventures funding it receives, from about $25 million in 2015 to $50-55 million this year. This is because GiveDirectly would prefer not to assume that the Good Ventures funding is ongoing from year to year. ### Advancing institutional partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to finalize its next two major partnerships this year. However, the likelihood of this will largely depend on how quickly these potential institutional partners are able to act. Currently GiveDirectly is prioritizing the largest donors in the international aid sector. If GiveDirectly is able to hire a partnerships manager in the near future, it may begin to look at the next tier of funders. Through these partnerships, GiveDirectly aims to influence the movement of official development assistance towards more cost-effective programs. It also hopes to have a similar effect on retail donations in the US, and on the actions of NGOs. ### Testing a basic income guarantee program\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to launch a test of a program that would guarantee a basic income to participants over the course of several years. The idea for a universal basic income has gained some traction around the world but has never been done in its full form and evaluated, so GiveDirectly believes this is a good time to test it. === Page 2 ===\n\nGiveDirectly has not yet finalized the amount of the basic income it would provide through this program. GiveDirectly wants the income to provide a meaningful level of support. The amount will likely be between 25 cents and just over $1 per day. The income would be transferred in regular installments over at least ten years. While a full universal basic income would not be feasible at the present time in some of the least developed countries because of budget constraints, there are other countries where it would be feasible. GiveDirectly also believes that the experiment will still be policy relevant even to budget-constrained country governments, as there are many potential variations that would be feasible (e.g., versions targeted to particular regions). GiveDirectly will study the impacts, many of which they expect to see in the first few years of the program. ### Doubling field staff capacity and hiring for future growth\n\nIn 2016, GiveDirectly would like to double the amount of money moved through its cash transfer programs. It also intends to conduct additional hiring and planning so that it can double its capacity again in 2017. GiveDirectly finds that its rate of growth is one of the most important factors affecting its ability to recruit and hire talent for more senior positions. It also believes that this growth is an important factor in driving the policy impacts it seeks to have by generating attention on GiveDirectly\'s model and on the questions that model raises for other, existing interventions. ### Testing program variations\n\nGiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:\n\n* **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others\' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once. * **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. ** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment. === Page 3 ===\n\n### Deprioritized areas for 2016\n\n#### Generic outreach to foundations\n\nGiveDirectly has been deprioritizing foundation outreach unrelated to specific projects for approximately the last year. #### Other learning projects\n\nGiveDirectly has deprioritized several learning projects that it concluded were not as important as the basic income guarantee experiment, such as distributing cash transfers in an urban setting or providing cash transfers to sex workers. #### Partnerships with combined funding/implementing organizations\n\nGiveDirectly is often approached by organizations such as UNICEF and World Food Programme (WFP) to provide assistance with running a cash transfer program or program component. However, GiveDirectly has generally chosen not to enter into such partnerships with organizations that are not the ultimate funders of international aid. The ultimate funders of aid programs are usually national governments, which then fund the World Bank and UN organizations. #### 2016 budget allocations\n\n#### Allocation of funds across countries\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable. #### Marketing budget\n\nFor both retail marketing and partnership projects, GiveDirectly plans to spend approximately $3-4 million, depending on when various personnel are hired. #### Good Ventures funding\n\nIf progress on partnership discussions is not satisfactory, GiveDirectly may dedicate some Good Ventures funding to other projects, such as the basic income guarantee program or some of the previously deprioritized learning projects described above. A third option would be further investment in building capacity in Rwanda. #### Room for more funding\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nCurrently GiveDirectly has the capacity needed to move the amount of funding it has secured and what it estimates it will receive in the future. If GiveDirectly had substantially greater funding, it would have to decide whether to hire more staff to expand its capacity, or redirect some of its existing staff\'s time away from more complex projects and operations and onto a simpler method of distributing cash transfers. Additional funding would likely be allocated to standard cash transfers in Kenya, Uganda, or Rwanda. The basic income guarantee program will allow for a higher volume of cash distributed by each field director, since by its nature it commits a larger amount of money to each participant than the standard cash transfer programs. ### GiveDirectly\'s broader impact on the aid sector\n\nGiveDirectly conducts three activities that it believes may broadly affect aid policy:\n\n* Routine cash transfers funded by retail donors\n* Experimental cash transfers evaluated by outside researchers\n* Cash transfers delivered through a strategic partnership with an institutional funder. Dr. Niehaus believes that strategic partnerships may be the most influential of these three activities, but its impact is also the hardest to measure. ### Indirect impact on institutional policy through diffuse channels\n\nThere is currently an ongoing debate within the UN over how cash transfers might be incorporated into humanitarian aid, as the present system is largely built around in-kind assistance such as food, clothing, and shelter. Cash does not have an obvious place in the existing system. However, Dr. Niehaus believes that significant impact may come first through indirect influence of high-level officials. For example, in a recently released report, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that cash transfers should be the default form of aid to refugees where possible. This could have hypothetically resulted from conversations with his staffers who were aware of GiveDirectly. The statement could then influence other UN agencies to incorporate cash transfers into their activities. However, it is difficult to conclusively attribute any of these events to GiveDirectly\'s work. Mr. Bassin believes that public support from a highly placed official (such as the UN secretary-general) for a nontraditional form of aid like cash transfers can carry significant weight with institutional funders and staff decision makers, who tend to be very risk-averse. Second, Dr. Niehaus believes that the work of GiveDirectly, its findings, and its popularity with donors and the press can provide a tool for staff within bi-lateral and multi-lateral institutions to begin conversations about the efficacy of cash and how favorably it compares to other existing interventions. ### Impact on other implementing organizations\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nAssessing to what extent GiveDirectly\'s work has influenced other implementing organizations is also a challenge. GiveDirectly can provide examples that hint at its impact; for example, one group has written a grant proposal that includes several alternative models of aid, one of which is explicitly called "the GiveDirectly model." However, systematic measurement of how widespread this impact is would be very difficult. ### Overall strategy for influencing policy\n\nGiveDirectly believes influencing institutional funders is a complex process. It believes that its best strategic approach is to set up on-the-ground projects incorporating cash transfers, whenever possible with institutional funders as a partner, rather than to attend conferences or produce papers on the subject. Starting these projects requires operational capacity, the ability to find a strong and credible team of researchers, and some creativity in figuring out how to bring a project into accord with the regulations of the institutional partner. GiveDirectly has also found it especially helpful to be able to bring private dollars to the table to leverage matching dollars from institutional funders in order to catalyze their participation. GiveDirectly is among the few organizations with the skills and willingness to take on this kind of work, with the aim of setting up projects that will foster debate within the international aid community. ### Operational update on Homa Bay County\n\n#### Increase in refusal rate\n\nGiveDirectly has seen an uptick in the rate of refusal to participate in its cash transfer program in Homa Bay. The root of this development is not clear, and GiveDirectly has not yet identified a solution. In some cases, community members are led by local religious leaders or local government to mistrust the program. In Siaya County, this issue did not arise, possibly because GiveDirectly covered such a large portion of the county that in any new area it entered, people were already aware of the program and knew that it was trustworthy. GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program\'s purpose. In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion. For this reason, it has not attempted to re-enroll those who refused, but might do so in the future. #### Targeting in Homa Bay\n\nAll enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note:** These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Paul Niehaus, Ms. Carolina Toth, and Mr. Ian Bassin. ## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus, Ms. Toth, and Mr. Bassin of GiveDirectly to receive updates on GiveDirectly's partnership projects and a $25 million grant GiveDirectly received from Good Ventures in June 2015 for general support. Conversation topics included GiveDirectly's progress on its hiring goals, partnership projects in Rwanda, and plans for partnership projects in other countries. ## Hiring a vice president of marketing\n\nGiveDirectly plans to use part of the grant from Good Ventures to hire a vice president of marketing. Progress on finding the right person has been slow, and GiveDirectly has not yet hired anyone for this position. (_Update: in September 2016, GiveDirectly hired Matt Johnson, former CMO of Tough Mudder and VP of marketing at Seamless, for this role._) GiveDirectly recently began to work with a recruiting firm to assist with the hiring process. This person will:\n\n* Lead a digital marketing strategy, which will include producing mobile, web, email, and social media content. * Be responsible for all levels of interactions with the public, from people who are first learning about GiveDirectly through managing the experience they have as donors. * Manage a $6-9 million fundraising budget. * Hire and lead a marketing team. ## Difficulty attracting qualified candidates\n\nThe market for qualified candidates is competitive. The candidates that GiveDirectly hopes to attract for this position could otherwise be earning about $500,000 per year at large, well-respected private sector companies, where they would be managing larger fundraising budgets (on the order of $100 million). Managing a\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nsmaller fundraising budget is not necessarily a deterrent for candidates, but while GiveDirectly aims to pay fairly and competitively, compensation has been an issue. Part of the reason it has been difficult to attract qualified candidates for this position is because the job description is fairly demanding. If GiveDirectly does not find anyone for this position in the next 6 months, it will consider splitting this into two separate roles. GiveDirectly expects to hire someone in the next 6 months, but has not set a concrete deadline for hiring because this may lead it to hire someone who is not an ideal candidate. There is currently no need to hire someone quickly, because GiveDirectly's retail revenue stream has been steady and is ahead of where it was last year. If this were to change, that would affect GiveDirectly's decisions about its hiring strategy. **Work that has been slowed down by the delay in hiring a marketing lead**\n\nlan Bassin, Max Chapnick, and Sharon Harvey have formed an interim retail team. Their work has been moving forward but is limited by capacity, and the projects listed below are expected to move more quickly after the vice president of marketing is hired. _Pardot_\n\nThe interim retail team is working with Pardot, an interface with Salesforce that enables GiveDirectly to manage email marketing more robustly than it had been previously. Pardot can be used to create automated donor life cycles, upsell donors in the life cycle, and distribute targeted content to people based on their interests. GiveDirectly plans to create a short video to distribute via email to test how well this type of content would work. _Media presence_\n\nGiveDirectly has been investing in its media presence, which has been one of the main drivers of its retail. It recently received a gift from MediaMath to run digital marketing campaigns and test online advertising during the holiday season. _Basic income guarantee project_\n\nSignature initiatives, such as the basic income guarantee project, help to generate attention and interest in GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has been working to increase the attention it gains from this initiative by increasing the amount of content it delivers from the field and testing ways to present that information. _Donor retention_\n\nGiveDirectly's work on testing strategies to retain and engage with existing donors is also moving more slowly in the absence of a marketing lead. _Creating mobile and web apps_\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly is working on creating mobile and web apps to enable donors to track their donations, when GiveDirectly enrolls recipients, and how those recipients fare after receiving transfers. There are internal versions of a mobile app that include many of the desired elements but are not polished enough to release yet. The next version, which is currently in development and which GiveDirectly hopes to launch by the end of the year, will be a web interface. This would have several advantages over mobile apps:\n\n* They are easier and cheaper to change and experiment with. This will allow GiveDirectly to create and test many versions before releasing it. * There seems to be a significant barrier to downloading a mobile app. For example, Humans of New York has millions of followers online but only about 5,000 downloads of its mobile app. * A web interface can more easily integrate with GiveDirectly's existing online presence. GiveDirectly has contract staff working on developing these tools temporarily. Once a vice president of marketing is hired, that person will hire a full-time team to continue the project. This project would be a top priority of a vice president of marketing. ### Hiring for other positions\n\nGiveDirectly has had more rapid success in hiring a team to meet its partnership goals. Ian Bassin and Jo Macrae were hired as part of this team. Ms. Macrae is formerly head of humanitarian policy at the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and will add capacity that will enable GiveDirectly to talk to large donors it has not worked with before about setting up research partnerships, particularly in Europe. GiveDirectly is ahead of its targets for this team, since two people have been hired to work on partnerships, while only one was expected to be hired by now. Engineering and digital marketing positions have been the most difficult to fill. Most other hiring goals for 2016 have been met, including hiring for positions in Africa. ### Operating cost per dollar raised\n\nGiveDirectly is currently running on 3$ per dollar raised, and believes that 5-10$ per dollar raised is a reasonable target as the organization grows. This figure is expected to increase temporarily after GiveDirectly hires additional staff, and then decrease over the long term due to the lifetime returns on its efforts to bring in new donors and encourage existing donors to become recurring donors. ### Partnership projects\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nNote: GiveDirectly was already planning the Rwanda project before Good Ventures' $25 million grant in June 2015. Good Ventures' grant has assisted with the progress of subsequent partnership project discussions. #### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions. #### Capacity-building in Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly. #### Other countries\n\nGiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations. However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:\n\n1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate. 2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country. 3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion. GiveDirectly has an agreement with a partner that would fall into these categories and could result in GiveDirectly running projects in up to 4 new countries. #### Expected timeline for new projects\n\nOne of GiveDirectly's strategic goals for 2016 is to finalize these negotiations, which it believes would lead to two new countries it will work in. It aims to have tentative agreements in place by the end of the year. === Page 5 ===\n\nGiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint. Starting and scaling up projects in 4 new countries at once would be a significant challenge. #### Matching funds\n\nGiveDirectly is offering up to $15 million in matching funds on a first-come, first-served basis to fund these types of projects. GiveDirectly hopes that offering the matching funding will incentivize large funders to move quickly on partnership projects. If all of GiveDirectly's partnership projects discussions came through, GiveDirectly would need to contribute $23-30 million. While GiveDirectly cannot fund all of the projects it is currently discussing, it would consider talking to partners about opportunities to fund any projects approved by these potential funders that are beyond GiveDirectly's funding limit. One of the large funders is unlikely to begin providing funding until early 2017. This funder and GiveDirectly would each contribute roughly $7 million to a project, for a rough total of $14 million. It is possible, though unlikely, that GiveDirectly could get funding from this funder by the end of 2016. (_Update: As of October 2016, GiveDirectly did not expect this project to happen._) GiveDirectly has had exploratory talks with another large funder. #### Government partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments). GiveDirectly hopes, however, that the benchmarks it sets in terms of operational efficiency and excellence will set the bar for what other cash transfer programs, including government-led ones, should be able to achieve. #### All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

Track record: Cash transfers are one of the most-studied development interventions, though evidence drawing a direct connection to particular humanitarian outcomes is sparse. We put the most weight on a randomized controlled trial of the short-term effects of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. This trial indicated that unconditional cash grants lead to large increases in recipients\' consumption, assets, business investment, and revenue, but did not observe a short-term increase in profits. Studies of cash transfer programs that differ in meaningful ways from GiveDirectly\'s have suggested that transfers may be invested at high rates of return over the long term. Cost-effectiveness: Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, and cash transfers are in the same range of cost-effectiveness of other priority programs we have considered. Bottom line: Cash transfers have the strongest track record we\'ve seen for a non-health intervention, and are a priority program of ours. === Page 2 ===\n\n_Published: December 2012; Last updated: November 2018_\n\nPrevious versions of this page:\n\nNovember 2017 version\n\nNovember 2015 version\n\n2014 version\n\n2013 version\n\n2012 version\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProgram description\n\nProgram Track Record\n\nHow do people spend the money they receive via cash\n\ntransfers?

Our process\n\n2012\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n#### Program description\n\nThere are three types of cash transfer programs that have been studied:\n\n* Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), in which recipients receive cash only if they fulfill various requirements such as rates of school attendance or visits to health centers. There is a subset of CCTs in which the conditions are announced but are not formally monitored, so all participants receive a transfer regardless of compliance with the announced conditions.1\n* Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), in which selected participants receive funds without a requirement to meet additional conditions. * Business grant programs, in which unconditional in-kind or cash grants are given to micro-enterprises that have no paid employees other than the owners. The program conducted by GiveDirectly is different from most of the cash transfer programs that have previously been studied because it aims to transfer _wealth_ rather\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nthan _income_, and not exclusively to business-owners. In practice, this means that participants receive large sums of money (~100% of per-capita annual consumption) over a relatively short period of time (~8 months), with no formal or informal restrictions on how the funds are used. We review the results of all three different types of cash transfer programs that have been studied, including a **randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program**, in order to address the likely effects of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers. In the case of conditional cash transfers, we focus on impacts that do not seem relevant to the conditionality itself, e.g., impacts on consumption rather than on school attendance or other behaviors that are conditions of receiving the transfers. ## Program Track Record\n\nBelow is a list of the cash transfer programs evaluated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that we reviewed for our initial report in 2012.2 This list includes basic information about the program and key findings from the RCT that studied the program. We discuss many of the studies in more detail on **our old cash transfer review page**. For a list of the studies we identified in our 2013 update of this report, see this footnote.3\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\n9/10/2020\nRed De\nCCT\nHealth: workshops,\nProteccion\n\nregular health care visits,\n\nup-to-date vaccinations,\n\n(2000-). adequate weight gain;\n\nEducation: enrollment,\n\n85% attendance, grade\n\npromotion.13\nAtencion a\nCCT\nEducation: enrollment,\n\nCrisis (2005),\n\n85% attendance;\n\noccupational training\n\ncourse; business grant\n\nplan.17\n\nplan.17\n\n18% of PCE;18\n\n-30% higher food\n\nbimonthly19\nconsumption; more use\n\nof health services;\n\nimproved self-reported\n\nhealth but unimproved\n\non anthropometric\n\nmeasures (more)\n\nBono de\nCCT but\nNo monitoring.

GiveDirectly\'s program is substantially different from nearly all cash transfer programs that have previously been studied. Accordingly, it is not clear that evidence from most academic studies (of very differently-structured cash transfer programs) will provide accurate estimates of the effect of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers on their recipients; GiveDirectly\'s transfers might be either far more or far less effective than more conventionally-structured cash transfers: receiving large lump sums might lead people to spend more frivolously; or lump sums might be invested at higher rates than ongoing transfers would be, leading to higher long-term consumption. For this reason, in assessing GiveDirectly\'s impact, we put the most weight on the results of an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, discussed below. Despite the questions about the applicability of the evidence from other cash transfer programs to GiveDirectly\'s programs, we review this evidence below. === Page 8 ===\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on cash transfers but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nAs discussed at our old in-depth review of cash transfer impacts, most of the studies we have reviewed on cash transfers show meaningful impacts on food consumption (~20% increase over baseline/control group spending on food). In addition, the World Bank\'s review states, "There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, within the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels"46 - such as milk, meat, fruits, vegetables, and eggs.47\n\nAcross the four randomized controlled trials where it is measured in comparable terms, increases in spending on food makes up more than half of the transfer amount:\n\nIn a randomized study of the Mexican Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program, approximately three quarters of transfers are estimated to be spent on food.48\n\nA second study from Mexico, of the Programa Apoyo Alimentario, an unmonitored conditional cash transfer, found that nearly all (94%) of cash transfers were spent on food.49\n\nA randomized study of the RPS conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua estimated that roughly three quarters of the transfer was spent on food.50\n\nIn a randomized controlled trial of the CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program in Kenya, roughly half of transfers are spent on food.51\n\n=== Page 9 ===\n\n## Alcohol and tobacco\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on this topic but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, which did not find an increase in spending on alcohol or tobacco. For more on recipients\' spending on alcohol and tobacco in this study, see below._\n\nCash transfers could be used for alcohol or tobacco, which may have adverse effects. Three randomized controlled trials of cash transfers that report spending on alcohol or tobacco do not find large increases due to cash transfers:\n\nA randomized study of the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario food security program in Mexico, which had formal conditions that were not enforced, found that cash transfers caused an increase in alcohol consumption equivalent to 1.5% of the value of the transfer, and no increase in tobacco consumption.52 The authors add, "Only 5% of households report consuming alcohol in any amount. This is most likely an underestimate as the survey was usually answered by the female head of the households who might not be aware of all alcohol purchases by other family members. Importantly, given the large increase in consumption of non-alcohol goods under both transfer types, there is little leeway for household members to purchase non-recorded alcohol. "53\n\nIn a randomized study of the Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer program Red de Proteccion Social, alcohol and tobacco made up 0.5% of food expenditures, and the effect of cash transfers was small (0.1% of food expenditures) and statistically insignificant.54 However, this study also states, "Information about alcohol and tobacco expenditures in these types of surveys is often unreliable; it is presented separately and we draw no conclusions from the reported information. "55\n\n=== Page 10 ===\n\nA randomized evaluation of Kenya\'s CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program found a small and statistically insignificant decrease in alcohol consumption.56\n\nIn all three studies, these results come from surveys of how people spend money in general, rather than specifically asking about the spending of cash transfer funds, and then comparing reported spending on alcohol and tobacco across the treatment and control groups. Different forms of misreporting of spending would have different effects on the validity of the estimates, but we would guess that the misreporting would lead the estimated effects to be biased downward (i.e. to underestimate the effect of transfers on alcohol consumption).57\n\nA study by the World Bank, which we haven\'t looked at closely, reviewed "19 studies with quantitative evidence on the impact of cash transfers on temptation goods [primarily alcohol and tobacco], as well as 11 studies that surveyed the number of respondents who reported they used transfers for temptation goods" and concluded that "Almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of transfers on temptation goods [and in] the only (two, non-experimental) studies with positive significant impacts, the magnitude is small. "58\n\nTaking into account the three studies, the review and the potential for bias, we would guess that any increases in consumption of alcohol or tobacco due to cash transfers would be small. ### Investment\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012.

Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nWe have seen five studies examining the extent to which people invest their cash transfers, leading to longer-term gains:\n\n**Gertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012** is a followup of a randomized rollout of the Oportunidades program in Mexico, in which the treatment group was randomly selected to receive conditional cash transfers a year and a half earlier than the control group. It finds that people in the treatment group saw faster increases in their ownership of farm assets like land, started more microenterprises-"mainly production of handcrafts for sale"-and ultimately saw ~5% higher consumption levels than those in the control group, even four years after the latter had been enrolled in the program.59 The authors estimate that 74% of transfers are consumed and 26% are invested, an estimate that we discuss in more depth below.60 They go on to say:61\n\nNote that our estimate of the [marginal propensity to consume] MPC is consistent with other estimates in developing countries. For example, Musgrove (1979) estimates MPCs of 0.881 for urban Colombia, 0.896 for urban Ecuador, and, 0.776 for urban Peru; and Bhalla (1979) reports an MPC of 0.61 for rural India. Moreover, its value is relatively high, which is suggestive that beneficiaries are perceiving the program as a permanent --as opposed to transitory--source of income: Paxson (1992) reports MPCs out of permanent income from 0.56 to 0.84, and MPCs out of transitory income ranging from 0.17 to 0.27 for a sample of rice farmers in Thailand. A randomized evaluation of the Nicaraguan _Red de Proteccion Social_, a conditional cash transfer program, did not find any change in investment (except in human capital) due to the cash transfers.62 However, the authors note that, "households are indeed following the recommendations of the program; that is, they are spending most of their income from the program on current (food and education) expenditures. "63\n\n=== Page 12 ===\n\nA randomized evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), an ongoing unconditional cash transfer program, found that 87% of the transfer was consumed.64 The remaining 13% is not accounted for by the study, but the authors speculate that it may be invested.65 It could also have been saved (without investment), transferred to other individuals, or simply mismeasured.66 In a randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Sri Lanka, recipients reported that 58% of their unconditional grants were immediately invested in the business, another 12% was saved, and the remaining 30% was spent on household consumption, investment, or other uses.67 Measures of the impact of the grants on capital stock show more dramatic effects, suggesting that cash grants increase capital stock for the recipient\'s micro-enterprise by as much as 100% of the grant amount.68 A similar randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Ghana estimated that cash grants to women increased household spending by 50-80% of their value during the quarter following grant receipt and cash grants to men increased household spending by 33-50% of their value, though the estimate for men was not statistically significant. The variation in estimated spending, especially amongst women, arises from very high levels of household spending amongst relatively few individuals, though the results for women remain significant after truncating at various levels.69 The estimated effects of the cash grants on business capital stock were not statistically significant, but varied between roughly one third and one half of the transfer value for women and between roughly zero and 20% of the transfer value for men, depending on whether full or truncated values were used.70 Note, though, that the cash transfers by GiveDirectly are both larger and made to poorer individuals than any of the transfers discussed above: Economic theory and the citations quoted above from Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) suggest that larger, shorter term transfers are more likely to be invested than smaller, ongoing transfers, and comparing the results from the\n\n=== Page 13 ===\n\nongoing cash transfers and the business grants appears to bear this conclusion out, though the estimates overlap significantly. However, there is also a potential tradeoff with beneficiary wealth: poorer recipients are typically expected to consume more of a cash transfer, relative to wealthier individuals. This coincides with our worry that GiveDirectly\'s focus on targeting the poorest may be systematically targeting individuals who are less likely to invest or, if they do invest, to reap large returns. ## What return on investment do cash-transfer recipients earn? _Note: the section below was originally published in December 2012. In September-October 2013, we searched for additional literature on this topic (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in which recipients earned substantially smaller returns. Two other new studies found high returns from unconditional cash grants with features encouraging investment.78 In November 2013, we updated this section to include results from these three studies._\n\n## A variant of GiveDirectly\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.72 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.73 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.74\n\n=== Page 14 ===\n\nGiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.77 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.78 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is discussed in much more detail below. ### Unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTwo studies of unconditional wealth transfers in Uganda both found high annual returns of 30%-39% on the original grant.79 Both of these programs included many features designed to encourage investment and improve returns, which distinguish them from GiveDirectly\'s intervention. The studies are discussed in more detail below. ### Conditional cash transfers\n\n=== Page 15 ===\n\nThe only randomized controlled trial of ongoing cash transfers that discusses the returns that recipients earn on their investments is based on the Dportunidades conditional cash transfer program in Mexico, described above.80 Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that, four years after the control group began to receive treatment and five and a half years after the treatment group began to receive transfers, the treatment group continued to have consumption 5.6% higher than the control group.81 This implies, by our calculation, a 1.7% monthly return, and a 21% annual return, on the transfers,82 which further implies a 3.6% monthly, and 42.6% annual, rate of return on investment.83 Using a different method, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that for every hundred dollars transferred more than two years ago, recipients continue to earn $1.60 per month in additional income, for an annual return of 19.2%, even though they estimate that only 26% of transfers are invested.84 Since only 26% of transfers are invested, this implies an even higher rate of return on _investments_, of roughly 75% per year, or 6% per month.85 In these calculations, the authors do not rely purely on the randomized comparison between the treatment and control group. Instead, they estimate current consumption as a result of current and past cumulative transfers, which depend both on the randomized roll-out of the program, and on the number, age, gender, and school attendance of the children in a family. While the number, age, and gender of children are plausibly exogenous (i.e. they are not influenced by current consumption), and thus can just be included in the regressions as controls, the school attendance of children in the family is endogenous: worse school attendance is likely to lead to both decreased transfers (since the conditions punish families for not sending children to school) and increased consumption, since children not in school may be more likely to work. For exogenous variation in the transfers, the authors use instruments consisting of the _maximum amount of transfers that the family could have received_ had their children had perfect attendance.86 This explains a large portion of the variation in actual transfers received, and is likely exogenous (i.e. maximum potential transfers are\n\n=== Page 16 ===\n\nlikely "as good as random" once family demographics are controlled for, and family demographics are likely not influenced by consumption). Regressing current consumption on the current transfers and cumulative transfers from previous years, the authors estimate that every $100 in current transfers translates into an additional $48.70 of reported spending during the past month, and every $100 in transfers from more than 2 years ago translates into an additional $1.50 of reported spending during the past month.87 However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the total effect because many students worked, causing both a reduction in transfers for them relative to the maximum possible and an increase in consumption for their families (through their wages).88 By assuming that maximum potential transfers influence current consumption only through actually received transfers, which seems plausible, (i.e. by using maximum potential transfers as an instrument for actual transfers) the authors estimate that $100 of actually received transfers this month increases consumption by $74, and $100 of actually received transfers from more than two years ago increases consumption this month by $1.60.89\n\nThe authors pursue this instrumental variables strategy, rather than just regressing current consumption on total realized transfers, because the realized transfers are negatively correlated with consumption because of the child labor effects of conditionality, which would lead to an underestimate of the effects of transfers. The three different estimates discussed for long-term annual returns on cash transfers are quite similar (20.4%, 18%, 19.2%), though the estimated returns on _investment_ differ significantly (42.6%, 35%, 73.8%), because of different estimates of how much of the transfers are consumed. ## Business grants\n\nThese estimated returns seem quite high, but there is a separate literature on the returns to capital in micro-enterprises that is relevant to this issue. In a series of experiments in Sri Lanka, Mexico, and Ghana, researchers giving grants on the order\n\n=== Page 17 ===\n\nof $100 to micro-enterprises without any paid employees have found high returns on investment, in the range of 6%-46% _per month_.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

papers by de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff based on a randomized controlled trial of one-time grants to micro-enterprises in Sri Lanka have found large positive effects on profits for male owners.90 Approximately five years after initially making grants of $100-$200, divided between cash and in-kind gifts, to microenterprises that did not have any non-owner employees, the authors found $8-$12 higher monthly profits in male-owned businesses that received grants.91 This translates to a 6-12% monthly real return amongst male-owned businesses (with no measured benefits amongst businesses owned by women).92 In earlier work covering the first two years after the grants were made, the authors found similar monthly rates of return, and could not reject the hypothesis that cash and in-kind grants had similar effects on profits.93 During the first two years after the grants were made, the combined effect of the cash on men and women was large and statistically significant, though the returns for men were substantially larger than for women,94 but after five years, the combined effect for men and women appears to no longer be statistically significant (this is our conjecture; we cannot confirm it without examining the raw data and calculations for the study, which we have not done).95 In a similar randomized experiment conducted in Ghana, with a larger sample size and shorter follow-up period, Fafchamps et al. (2011) found comparable large effects on microenterprise profits for in-kind transfers (~20% return per month), but effects on business profits for cash were statistically indistinguishable from zero.96 As discussed above, this may be a result of recipients spending transfers in the household rather than investing in their businesses. A similar randomized controlled trial in Mexico, which gave cash or in-kind grants of about $140 to retail micro-enterprises (all owned by men and without paid employees), found returns to capital of 28 to 46% per month over a 3-12 month follow-up period, with indistinguishable differences between cash and in-kind grants.97 The biggest effects (~100% return per month) were concentrated within the 38% of micro-enterprises that were very credit-constrained.98 Although the\n\n=== Page 18 ===\n\neffects in the credit-constrained subgroup were large and precisely-estimated, the study suffered from substantial attrition (>50% in both treatment and control groups, with similar rates for the two), harming its power and calling the accuracy of the estimates into question.99\n\n### RCT of GiveDirectly's program\n\nWe place very high weight on the results of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, a publicly pre-registered, randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly's program in Rarieda, Western Kenya, because the intervention it evaluated was the most similar to GiveDirectly's standard program out of all of the RCTs we have seen and because it explicitly addressed issues related to selective reporting bias and multiple comparison problems.100 The trial differed from GiveDirectly's standard program in one key way: while GiveDirectly currently transfers $1,000 to program recipients, 72% of treatment group members in the evaluation received just $287, less than 30% of the standard amount (one smaller treatment arm did receive $1,085 transfers).101 When interpreting the results, we keep this difference in mind because we believe that the size of a transfer probably has substantial effects on the magnitude of its impact and its effect on recipients' behavior. ### How the program worked\n\nGiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.102 While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.103 Please see our review of GiveDirectly for much more detail on GiveDirectly's program. === Page 19 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013's evaluation of GiveDirectly was randomized on two levels: eligible villages were randomly sorted into treatment and control groups and eligible households within treatment villages were randomized again into treatment households and controls.104 Researchers were therefore able to calculate treatment effects by comparing treatment households to control households within treatment villages.105 They could also calculate the spillover effects the transfers had on non-recipients by comparing control households in treatment villages to otherwise similar households in control villages.106\n\nDifferent variations of the program were evaluated. Treatment households were cross-randomized into three arms, which varied the gender of the recipient (when households had both male and female household heads), the frequency of the transfer (lump-sum v. monthly installment), and the size of the transfer ($287 v. $1,085).107 The study measured short-term effects of the transfer.108 The time between end-line survey and receipt of final transfer ranged from zero months (for households still receiving transfers when they were surveyed) to fifteen months.109\n\n## Effects on GiveDirectly recipients\n\n72% of treatment group households in the evaluation received just $287; the rest received $1,085.100 In the sections below, we use the outcomes from the larger transfer group unless otherwise specified, because GiveDirectly typically gives transfers of similar size.11 For every outcome, the larger transfer led to more spending compared to the smaller transfer with a few exceptions, where we have noted the outcome for the smaller transfer group in the text, and for tobacco and alcohol and indices of health and education, where the effects were not statistically different from zero. Though we report transfer sizes in exchange-rate adjusted terms, we report the outcomes in purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted U.S. dollars.12\n\n=== Page 20 ===\n\n### How GiveDirectly transfers were spent\n\nResearchers collected data by surveying members of the treatment and control groups about their recent spending. All data that follows comes from participant self-reports. GiveDirectly recipients increased the value of their non-land assets and their monthly consumption.103 Their spending is broken down in more detail below. ##### Total non-land assets.104\n\nReceipt of large transfers increased households' non-land assets by an average of $463 (95% CI: $378 to $549).105 The largest categories of asset increases were livestock ($131, 95% CI: $79 to $183), durable goods ($100, 95% CI: $71 to $129; primarily furniture), and savings ($18, 95% CI: $9 to $27).106 Households receiving transfers (small or large) were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 17% to 29%) more likely to have an iron roof than the control households.107 Though Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 doesn't report the change in likelihood for recipients of large transfers alone, recipients of large transfers were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 13% to 33%) more likely to have iron roofs at end-line than recipients of small transfers.108 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 estimated that iron roofs cost about $564 USD PPP based on a survey of one respondent in each of 20 villages.109 GiveDirectly ran a survey that sampled a respondent from each of 20 villages and found that iron roofs cost $418 USD PPP on average.100 We do not know what explains this discrepancy. ##### Business expenses. Households receiving large transfers spent about $13 per month (95% CI: $1 to $25) more than control households on business expenses, which were primarily made up of non-durable expenses on non-agricultural businesses.102 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $13 more per month (95% CI: $4 to $22).102\n\n##### Health expenditures\n\nRecipients of large transfers spent about $3 (95% CI: -$1 to $6) per month more than control households on health expenditures.103 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $3 (95% CI: $1 to $5) more.104 This spending was also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below. ##### Education expenditures. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $1.89 (95% CI: $0.20 to $3.58) more than\n\n=== Page 21 ===\n\nthe control households on education expenditures and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $0.79 (95% CI: -$0.31 to $1.89) more.285 We're not sure of the time period over which this estimate is calculated. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 also reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $16.26 (95% CI: -$6.50 to $39.02) more than control households on education expenditures in the past month and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $19.41 (95% CI: -$12.22 to $44.74) more.286 We're not sure if the difference between the two estimates is due to the difference in the samples used to calculate them (they have different sample sizes) or the different time periods over which they might be calculated or some other explanation.287 Education expenditures were also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below. **Consumption. ** Treatment households consumed about $51 more per month (95% CI: $32 to $70) than control households.128 About half of this additional consumption was on food.129 This additional consumption also included increased spending on social expenditures and various other expenditures.130\n\n**Alcohol and tobacco. ** Treatment households did not increase their spending on alcohol or on tobacco.131\n\n### Impacts of GiveDirectly transfers on recipients\n\n**Food security. ** At baseline, food security was low among participants.132 Program participants reported a 0.37 standard deviation (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57) increase in a food security index over controls.133\n\n**Health and education. ** The study did not detect an effect on indices of health and educational outcomes.134\n\n**Revenue and profits. ** Receipt of large transfers lead to a $15 per month (95% CI: -$1 to $32) increase in total revenues and receipt of small transfers lead to a $17 (95% CI: $4 to $30) increase but neither resulted in a detectable increase in profits.135 We\n\n=== Page 22 ===\n\nemphasize that these are very short-run effects and we do not know whether participants' business investments might lead to profits in the longer run. Researchers also considered more subjective measures of impact on recipients' quality of life:\n\nPsychological well-being. Treatment improved an index of psychological wellbeing by 0.45 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.65).36 There was no observable effect on cortisol for the treatment group as a whole although cortisol, an indicator of stress, was slightly lower in the large transfer group than the small transfer group, a difference that was statistically significant at the 10% level when controls were included in the model.37\n\nFemale empowerment. Control households in treatment villages measure 0.23 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.41) higher on an index of female empowerment than control households in control villages.38 This suggests that cash transfers to a village unexpectedly empowered females in both recipient and non-recipient households. The researchers propose potential mechanisms for this effect, but are explicit that these measured results are surprising and warrant further investigation.39 Note that we report this result for the sake of comprehensiveness but would guess that it is more likely to be random than real. ### Spillover effects and village-level effects\n\n_Update (November 2018): We provide a more recent and detailed discussion of these effects below._\n\nOther than the potential positive effects on female empowerment. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 found no statistically significant spillover effects (i.e., effects on non-recipient households in recipient villages).140 However, imprecise and statistically insignificant point estimates suggest the possibility of moderate negative effects on non-recipient households.141\n\n=== Page 23 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nThe study found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, wages, or crime but estimates are imprecise.142\n\n## Program variations\n\nThe study did not find statistically discernible differences when it varied the gender of the recipient.143 There was some evidence suggesting that recipients of lump-sum transfers were more likely to purchase assets and recipients of monthly installments were more likely to spend their transfers on food.144\n\n### Limitations\n\nSpillover and village-level effects: differences from GiveDirectly's standard model. Large transfers might have very different spillover effects and village-level effects from small transfers. Spillover effects and village-level effects also might be larger in GiveDirectly's standard model, where all eligible households in treatment villages receive transfers, than in the RCT, where a control group within the village does not receive transfers. **Medium and long-term results. **Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is a short-term evaluation of GiveDirectly.\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

know whether the additional consumption enabled by the transfers will persist over the long-term and whether households\' investment in business expenditures might lead to long-term profits.145 The long-term effects of cash transfers are a key question that affects our estimate of the intervention\'s cost effectiveness. **Dynamics of transfers. ** The dynamics of the program\'s effects are particularly difficult to interpret because some households were still receiving payments at the time of the survey while others received their final transfers more than a year prior to the endline survey.146 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 may have\n\n=== Page 24 ===\n\nunderestimated effects on investment spending and farm revenue by asking backwards looking questions about treatment households\' spending in time periods before some households received their transfers.147\n\nData on roofs. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.148 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.149 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.150 GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.151 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.152 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.153 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.154 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Lack of statistical powerThe study included 471 households cross-randomized among three treatment arms, which led to eight possible treatment groups.155 Some treatment arms therefore have fairly small sample sizes (for example, only 128 households received large transfers) and estimates of relative effects of treatment arms are imprecise. Self-reporting biasOutcome data in this study are self-reported, which could lead to positive bias if treatment households sought to please researchers with their use of the transfers. We are especially concerned that treatment households might under-report their use of alcohol and tobacco. === Page 25 ===\n\n#### Positive bias due to negative spillovers. The study estimates treatment effects by comparing treatment households in treatment villages to control households in treatment villages.156 If transfers had negative spillover effects on control households in treatment villages, estimates of their effects on recipients would be overestimated. The researchers address this issue explicitly in their paper.157\n\n### Our interpretation of the results\n\nWe place high weight on Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 because we believe it is a well-executed, pre-registered RCT and because it directly measures variations on GiveDirectly\'s program. We believe that the RCT supports the notion that, in the short-run, participating in GiveDirectly is likely to increase recipients\' assets and consumption.158\n\nBecause of the study\'s short-term nature, we cannot confidently determine whether recipients\' increased spending on livestock, agriculture, non-agricultural businesses, and (possibly) education have positive returns but, as of the time of the end-line survey, recipients\' additional business spending had not yielded additional profits.159\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 supports the notion that GiveDirectly has meaningful impacts on asset holdings and consumption for recipients. However, it also provides initial evidence that GiveDirectly recipients are unlikely to invest their transfers in business activities at high returns, as seen in RCTs of programs that provide business training in addition to cash transfers and/or require recipients to propose business plans. === Page 26 ===\n\n# Evidence from two studies of unrestricted wealth transfers\n\nHere we provide more detail on two studies which provided unrestricted cash grants to recipients in Uganda, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) (evaluated by Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013) and the Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program (evaluated by Blattman et al 2013). We discuss these programs in detail because they are the best evidence, other than the RCT of GiveDirectly\'s program, of the effects of unrestricted wealth transfers to individuals. However, both program differ from GiveDirectly\'s in key ways including their features that encourage recipients to invest their transfers. ## The Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda\n\n### How the program worked\n\nIn YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.160 In general, participants were "young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed. "161 Groups submitted written proposals and could request up to $1,000 for non-agricultural skills training and start up costs.162 Cash was transferred to bank accounts in the name of treatment groups\' management committees and no restrictions were placed on the money\'s use.163 The size of the grants varied widely; the average grant was $382 per capita and 80% of grants were between $200 and $600 per capita.164\n\n### How did YOP recipients spend the transfers? Most groups chose one trade and chose to have all members enter that trade.165 Strong evidence suggests that participants invested a large majority of their funds. At the median, treatment group members estimated that their group and fellow members spent 11% on skills training, 52% on tools, 13% on materials, and 24% shared\n\n=== Page 27 ===\n\nin cash or spent on other things.166 When asked about their own investments two years after the distribution, treatment group members reported 340 more hours of vocational training than controls, most of which was in tailoring, carpentry, metalwork, or hairstyling.167 On average, treatment group members also reported $219 more in business assets than controls two years after the disbursement, although this difference was reduced to $130 after four years.168\n\n### What were the overall effects of YOP? **Labor supply. ** Program participants worked 4.1 more hours per week than controls in 2010 and 5.5 more hours per week in 2012.169 In general, participants increased the hours that they spent working in skilled trades to supplement their agricultural income but continued to spend the same amount of time working in agriculture as controls.170\n\n**Return on investment. ** There is fairly strong evidence that YOP participants received large returns on their investments, leading to higher income than controls in the long-run. Members of treatment groups earned $8.50 more per month than controls in 2010 and $10.50 more per month in 2012.171 Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 estimate that the increased earnings in 2010 and 2013 represent average annual returns on the original grant of 30% and 39% respectively.172 There is no evidence that treatment group members earned more per hour than control group members, so the return probably comes from increased opportunities to do profitable work.173\n\n**Other impacts. ** Participation in YOP also lead to increased durable assets, non-durable consumption, and subjective well-being.174 There was no evidence that YOP affected non-economic factors such as kin integration, community participation, community and public good contributions, anti-social behavior, and protest attitudes and participation.175\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from YOP to GiveDirectly\'s program. === Page 28 ===\n\n#### Group structure. The group structure of YOP may have acted as a commitment device, leading recipients to invest a greater portion of their grants than recipients of unconditional transfers directly to individuals, like GiveDirectly.176\n\n##### Application process. Groups had to apply for grants with a proposal for investing in skilled trades.177 Motivated, patient, or talented individuals may have been more likely to apply and less likely to be screened out, which could have increased the propensity to invest or returns on investment.178 The application process could also have led to more investment through a mental accounting mechanism, by framing the grant in terms of business.179\n\n##### Size of grant. YOP grants were, on average, $382 per group member.180 Like GiveDirectly, YOP\'s grants are one-time unconditional wealth transfers. However, YOP\'s grants are less than 40% of the size of GiveDirectly\'s. We do not have a strong intuition about whether this would lead GiveDirectly recipients to invest a larger or smaller portion of their transfers. However, GiveDirectly participants may have lower ROIs if recipients experience diminishing returns on investment. ##### Long-run effects and divestment. Treatment members\' increased earnings can only be interpreted as return on investment if they are expected to be maintained in the long-run. There is evidence that some recipients divested from their grant over time, which could mean that earning gains were not permanent.181\n\n##### Demographic limitations. Program participants were mostly young adults.182 The effects on business assets and earnings largely disappear if the data is reweighted to reflect the demographic distribution of the entire population.183\n\n##### The Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program in Northern Uganda\n\n##### How the program worked\n\nVillages in WINGS were randomly assigned to one of two phases.184 Participants assigned to phase one entered WINGS in mid-2009 and received five days of business\n\n=== Page 29 ===\n\nskills training, a $150 startup grant (once they had a business plan approved), and follow up visits and advice from AVSI staff.185 Half of phase 1 participants were also randomly assigned to receive business networking training.186 An end-line survey in November 2010 allowed Blattman et al 2013 to estimate the medium-term effects of the full WINGS program by comparing phase 1 villages to phase 2 villages (who had not yet entered the program).187\n\nPhase 2 villages (which served as controls during phase 1) entered WINGS in early 2011.188 To disentangle the effects of the cash grants from the effects of follow-up, researchers randomly assigned one-third of these villages to receive no follow-up.189\n\nIn all, 1,800 of the most vulnerable 14-30 year olds in 120 villages in two districts were selected by AVSI and community leaders to participate in WINGS\' two phases.190\n\n"[T]he typical WINGS candidate was a young woman between the ages of 20 and 35, with little or no formal education, low income and limited access to credit. "191\n\n### How did WINGS recipients spend the transfers? Over half of all participants proposed selling mixed items in their AVSI-approved business plans.192 The vast majority of other business involved the selling of livestock, fish, and farm products.193\n\nWhen participants themselves estimated the proportion of the grant they spent on different categories, those recipients who did not receive follow up from AVSI staff reported that 27% of the grant was spent on business, 15% was spent on long-term consumption, 2% was spent on short-term consumption, and 54% was saved.194 However, when recipients were asked to estimate the cash amount that they spent on their businesses, they reported an average of just $14.50 of business expenditures, suggesting that they spent less than 10% of the grant on business expenditures.195\n\n### What were the overall effects of WINGS 18 months after the grants were distributed? Phase 1 and phase 2 villages were surveyed eighteen months after phase 1 villages entered WINGS (and before phase 2 villages entered). === Page 30 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\n**Labor supply. ** Participating in WINGS caused a 61% increase in employment hours, which consisted of a 41% increase in hours spent on subsistence work and a 79% increase in hours spent on market activities.196\n\n**Earnings and return on investment.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences.

We attempted to combine the results from these studies and create a model of the magnitude of possible spillover effects. However, we did not feel comfortable relying on this model because we lack basic information on a number of key parameters, such as how many non-recipient households may be affected by spillover effects for each treated household and how the magnitude of spillover effects changes with\n\n=== Page 37 ===\n\ndistance. We would revisit this explicit model if further academic analysis is able to shed light on these parameters. In the meantime, our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. We believe potential negative spillover effects of GiveDirectly\'s program are likely to be minimal on net for a number of reasons, including: the largest and highest quality study (the GE study) found no evidence of negative spillovers, and we have not seen strong evidence on the mechanisms for large negative spillover effects. However, given that negative spillover effects via inflation are theoretically plausible, and given that three studies find evidence of negative spillovers, we do include a small negative discount in our cost-effectiveness analysis for this concern. We emphasize that our conclusion at this point is very tentative, and we hope to update our views next year if there is more public discussion or research on the areas of uncertainty highlighted in our analysis. For more, see our full report on this question. ## What versions of the intervention are best? We have reviewed one RCT comparing physical cash transfers with electronic transfers to a recipient\'s cell phone.224 The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash. Had the study continued longer, the cheaper ongoing costs of the cell phone transfer mechanism would have made up for the higher initial costs.225 The study also finds that recipients of the cell phone transfer recipients had to walk less than 25% as far, on average, as those who received physical cash in order to "cash out" their transfers (0.9 vs. 4.04 km).226 The cell phone transfers also appear to have\n\n=== Page 38 ===\n\nincreased the diversity of crops grown and consumed by people who received them, relative to the "placebo" group that just received physical transfers and a cell phone.227\n\nThe study did not find any adverse effects of using cell phone transfers relative to handing out physical cash. ## 2012\n\nInitially, we conducted searches on JSTOR and Google Scholar for terms related to cash transfers, especially seeking out systematic reviews, and tracing citations in order to find randomized trials. We relied particularly heavily on two major literature reviews in our research on CCTs: a World Bank review228 and a Cochrane review.229 Of the literature reviews that we found, we relied on these two because they included a high percentage of RCTs and they presented the data from the studies clearly. We also searched the World Bank DIME database for relevant studies, discussed with GiveDirectly staff, and added studies as they arose in the process of drafting and updating this report. ## 2013\n\nMany new studies on cash transfers have been published since December 2012. For this update we have not attempted to thoroughly read all new research published on\n\n=== Page 39 ===\n\ncash transfers over the course of the last year. We focused on a recently released RCT of a variation on GiveDirectly\'s program in Kenya.230\n\nWe also looked for RCTs with evidence on programs that were unconditional, large, wealth transfers (the approach taken by GiveDirectly) and research that appeared most likely to affect our views of the evidence for this intervention. We relied heavily on studies and commentary on cash transfers that were sent to us by people who follow GiveWell. We also looked at the abstracts of studies cited by two papers by Chris Blattman231, which reported results from experiments involving large, unconditional cash transfers. In addition, we searched Google Scholar for studies with "cash transfers" in the title from 2011-2013. We listed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cash transfers in a spreadsheet and read the abstract for all studies to try to identify studies that might change our views on the intervention. We also looked for evidence on the propensity to invest cash transfers, returns to investment, inflation, economic effects on non-recipients, spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients. ## Changes in our views\n\nIn general, the additional evidence we reviewed did not substantively change our assessment of the impact of cash transfers. We found little evidence that cash transfers caused inflation, negative economic effects on non-recipients, recipient spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients. The most significant updates to the evidence are results from a randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in Western Kenya. These results are broadly consistent with results measured in other cash transfer programs, but do\n\n=== Page 40 ===\n\nsuggest that GiveDirectly recipients may earn lower investment returns on their transfers than recipients in previously studied cash transfer programs. These results are particularly significant because they assess GiveDirectly\'s program itself. We continue to interpret other evidence for cash transfers cautiously, as most research examines programs that differ from GiveDirectly in that: 1) the transfers are conditional or framed heavily in terms of investment; 2) the transfers are 60% to 90% smaller than GiveDirectly\'s; 3) trainings or other services are provided alongside the transfers. We are not aware of any other studies of the propensity to invest large wealth transfers that were not framed as business grants, restricted to participants with investment proposals and/or provided alongside some form of business training or technical assistance. ### Studies we considered\n\nA list of the studies reviewed for our initial report in 2012 is available above. A list of the research on cash transfers that we have seen between December 2012 and December 2013 is available at this footnote.232\n\nThis list includes all new RCTs we have seen but does not attempt to comprehensively list every non-RCT that has been published, instead focusing on studies most likely to affect our views. ## 2014\n\nWe reviewed a list of studies and articles on cash transfers that we\'d come across or were sent to us throughout the year and conducted an informal search for additional studies that might substantively change our view on cash transfers. We did not find any study that passed that threshold and continue to rely on the studies identified in\n\n=== Page 41 ===\n\nour last review. We think that (a) studies of large, unrestricted cash transfers or (b) studies that rigorously examine the negative effects of cash transfers could potentially change our view. ## 2015\n\nWe primarily searched for new studies on (a) large, unconditional cash transfers and/or (b) the negative effects of cash transfers because we think these are the types of studies that would be most likely to affect our view of GiveDirectly\'s program. ### New studies on large, unconditional cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on large, unconditional cash transfers, we (a) searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 that contained the keywords "Haushofer and Shapiro 2013" (without the quotes) or "GiveDirectly", (b) reviewed studies mentioned in a section of a World Bank blog post on education and cash transfers and (c) reviewed a list of studies sent to us by Paul Niehaus of GiveDirectly. We identified the following papers as warranting further investigation, but all of the studies differed enough from GiveDirectly\'s program that they did not substantively change our view:233\n\nHarris 2015 is an observational study comparing households in Ethiopia that received very large cash transfers (5x annual consumption expenditure on average) as compensation for the government taking a substantial portion of their land (70% on average) to households that did not get their land taken away.234\n\nBlattman, Jamison and Sheridan 2015 randomly assigned $200 grants (about 3 months wages) to criminally engaged Liberian men (some also received therapy).235\n\nEmergency Economics 2014 examined a program that provided cash transfers ($575 USD per household over 5 months) to Syrian refugees in Lebanon during the winter.236\n\nWe also found a published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) whereas we previously relied on the policy report (Blattman et al 2013). The updated analysis did\n\n=== Page 42 ===\n\nnot substantively change our view, but we have added a small update from the new analysis about the effects of WINGS on non-participating households in the relevant section above. Finally, we examined a pilot study run by GiveDirectly, which they had previously sent to us, that randomized young women to receive large, unconditional transfers.237 This pilot study did not substantively change our view because it had a very small sample size, differed from GiveDirectly\'s core program, and did not seem to analyze return on investment of transfers.238\n\n## New studies on the negative effects of cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on the negative effects of cash transfers, we searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 with "cash randomized, "cash randomised", "cash experimental", or "cash experiment" (all without the quotes) in the title. We culled the studies based on their titles.239 We skimmed the 5 remaining studies for discussion on any negative effects of the transfer programs.240 We identified one of the studies (White and Basu 2014) as warranting further investigation (based on a cursory look, none of the other studies reported negative effects). White and Basu 2014, which examined the effect of change in payment schedule for a cash transfer program in Peru on expenditures on temptation goods, did not substantively change our view because it did not, in our view, find meaningfully negative effects (see following footnote for details).241\n\nWe also looked for discussion of negative effects in the new studies of large, unconditional transfers that we identified as warranting further investigation. None of the studies reported findings on negative effects that substantively changed our view because either (a) they did not find meaningfully negative effects of transfers, or (b) the potential negative effects seemed to be unlikely to apply to GiveDirectly\'s program.242\n\nHaushofer, Reisinger and Shapiro 2015 was released after we finished the search described above. We wrote up our view of the study. For more information on our search for studies, see this spreadsheet. === Page 43 ===\n\n## Other studies\n\nWe de-prioritized further investigation of two RCTs examining the effect of cash transfers on cognitive development (Barham, Macours and Maluccio 2013 and Gilligan and Roy 2014), because it seemed that the conditionality (or perceived conditionality) of the transfers in both studies played a key role in the outcomes, which makes these studies less relevant to GiveDirectly\'s unconditional transfer program.243\n\n## 2017\n\nThroughout the year we tracked new literature that might be relevant to assessing the impact of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfer program by:\n\nSetting up alerts so that we were notified whenever new studies cited key studies such as Haushofer and Shapiro 2013. Reviewing papers that were sent to us or that were discussed by various development economics blogs and social media accounts that we follow. We did not find any studies that we thought warranted deeper investigation at this time. We would conduct a deeper investigation of a cash transfer study if, based on the abstract, it seemed that it might provide high-quality information about the humanitarian impacts of unconditional cash transfers in contexts similar to those in which GiveDirectly operates.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

subtracting out the effects of follow-up visits by AVSI staff, we estimate that the other components of WINGS increased beneficiaries\' monthly net earnings by an average of about $4.49/month.197 From these earnings numbers we can estimate a mean monthly return on investment of about 3.0% and a mean annual return on investment of about 35.9% on the original $150 grant.198 These calculations are an overestimate of the return on the grant itself, however, because they include the benefits but not the (quite high) costs of services like business skills training, targeting and disbursement, and (for some recipients) group dynamics training.199 We cannot confidently disentangle the effects of the $150 grant from the effects of the add-on services. **Other economic effects. ** Participation in WINGS increased short-term spending, wealth, and savings.200\n\n**Inflation, economic externalities, and general equilibrium effects. ** Researchers surveyed randomly chosen non-participant households in treatment and control villages in order to measure WINGS\' effects on non-participants (who made up 75%-85% of households in treatment villages).201 By going into trade and increasing the supply of scarce goods, WINGS recipients appear to have created slightly lower prices for all village members.202 Blattman et al 2013 suggests that WINGS led to decreased profits for existing microentrepreneurs (through enhanced competition) and increased wages and income for non-participating agricultural workers (through reduced supply of agricultural labor as WINGS participants work less on others households\' plots).203 The published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) suggests that WINGS had little effect on the incomes or occupational choice of nonparticipating households.204 We have not attempted to reconcile these findings though it seems like the updated analysis makes a weaker claim about negative effects on nonparticipants than the policy report and it strikes us as reasonable to rely on the updated analysis. === Page 31 ===\n\n#### Hostility towards recipients\n\nOverall, recipients report a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.205\n\n##### Health and social impacts\n\nDespite large economic returns, WINGS led to few observable medium-run health and social improvements for participants.206\n\n##### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from WINGS to GiveDirectly\'s program. ##### Business plan requirement\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which the requirement to have a business plan approved encouraged participants to invest more money at higher returns than they would have in the absence of such a requirement. ##### Disentangling program elements\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which WINGS\' business skills training and group dynamics training may have contributed to positive outcomes. While we were able to adjust estimated returns to subtract out the effects of follow-up by AVSI workers, doing so also increases our uncertainty about the magnitude of returns. ##### Demographics\n\nWINGS participants were chosen as the most vulnerable members of their communities, while GiveDirectly transfers cash to about 40% of the households in a given village.207This could lead WINGS to have higher returns than GiveDirectly (if the poorest of the poor have the greatest credit constraints and therefore the greatest returns to capital) or could lead GiveDirectly to have higher returns (if the poorest of the poor have worse spending opportunities or make worse spending decisions). ##### Grant size\n\nWINGS\' grant of $150 is only 15% the size of GiveDirectly\'s $1,000 transfers. This could lead to GiveDirectly recipients achieving a higher or lower return on their transfers than WINGS recipients. This difference could also lead to differing effects on inflation and on village-wide economies. ##### Long-run effects and divestment\n\nThe longest run effects measured by Blattman et al 2013 were eighteen months. Our return on investment calculations assume that\n\n=== Page 32 ===\n\nearnings gains sustained over eighteen months are permanent and we would guess that these earnings gains are maintained in the long-term. However, households may gradually divest from their investments, causing temporary earnings gains. **Conflicting data on investment spending. **Blattman et al 2013 measures investment spending in two ways: 1) by asking grant recipients to estimate the portion of their grant that they spent on business expenditures; and 2) by surveying treatment and control households on their expenditures over the course of a month and comparing investment by treatment households against investment by controls.208 These methods result in very different estimates of investment spending, which leave us very uncertain about the proportion of grants that were invested and also decrease our certainty in the reliability of the study\'s (self-reported) survey data on the whole. **Incomplete description of methodology. **Blattman et al 2013 is a policy brief and does not contain the complete methodological description that we would ideally like to see in order to evaluate a study. For example, the study does not describe how data on participants\' net earnings or savings are measured. We believe that accurately measuring earnings and savings among the very poor is difficult so our uncertainty about this data somewhat reduces our confidence in our ROI estimates. ## Our interpretation of studies of unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTogether, Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 provide strong evidence that cash grants of about $150 to $600 to groups of poor applicants and to very poor, uneducated women with business training and business plans can lead to high returns in the medium-term. Blattman et al 2013 also provides some of the most relevant evidence we\'ve seen suggesting that hostility from neighbors is not a major\n\n=== Page 33 ===\n\nproblem for most recipients of cash transfers and that cash transfers do not cause inflation. However, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013\'s evaluation of GiveDirectly itself found much smaller business returns. We believe that some combination of GiveDirectly\'s lack of a business plan requirement, lack of business skills training, and broader age-range of participants is the best explanation for the apparently lower returns earned by its participants. However, it is also possible that the failure to find investment returns was caused by the shorter time horizon of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 and GiveDirectly participants\' investments may still mature. ## Cost-effectiveness of cash transfers\n\nSee the most recent version of our cash cost-effectiveness analysis on this page. In practice, these calculations are sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding:\n\nthe investment returns to cash transfers;\n\nthe subjective assessment of the relative value of averting child mortality and improving incomes for adults. We estimate that cash transfer programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. === Page 34 ===\n\n# What are the potential downsides of the intervention? There are a few potential adverse effects of cash transfers:\n\nInflation: a sudden injection of cash into an area may cause inflation. We reviewed four randomized controlled trials investigating this issue:\n\nIn Programa de Apoyo Alimentario, an un-monitored conditional cash transfer program, no significant effect on inflation was found. The researchers used surveys of stores and households to measure prices of goods at baseline and one year after cash transfers began.209 The reported prices were 2.7% higher in villages receiving cash transfers than in control villages after one year, though the increases were not statistically significant.200 We do not have a clear understanding of how the authors picked the prices they reported from the larger universe of prices they collected.201\n\nA randomized study of the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program finds small increases in prices of 5 of 36 food items for sale in treatment villages immediately following deployment of the cash transfers.202 Although the authors do not observe meaningful increases in prices, they do find positive externalities of cash transfers on ineligible families in treatment villages, equivalent to ~10% of consumption (which is about 2/3 of the benefits experienced by the eligible families in the treatment villages).203\n\nBlattman et al 2013, the study of WINGS in Uganda, found evidence of a slight decrease in village-wide prices.204\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, but estimates are imprecise and may not rule out the possibility of substantial inflation.205\n\n=== Page 35 ===\n\n### Cash transfers could discourage wage-earning work by adults. If adults can control the distribution of their work and leisure time, cash transfers may lead them to substitute some leisure for work, leading to a decrease in wages earned (but most likely not a decrease in overall income). A World Bank review of the evidence on cash transfers (which we have not vetted) examines this question and concludes that transfers "appear to have had, at most, modest disincentives for adult work"; it discusses 5 studies, of which 4 found no impact along this dimension.26\n\nBlattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 both found that cash transfers with features encouraging investment _increased_ hours worked by recipients.27Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found evidence of a $17/month increase in recipients\' total revenue, which suggests that did not decrease their hours worked.28\n\nNote that there is substantially more evidence suggesting that conditional cash transfer programs lead to reductions in _child_ labor,29 which may help explain the gap between transfer sizes and observed increases in consumption.220\n\n### Giving cash to some and not others could possibly cause social unrest. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no significant effects of transfers on the rate of crime in treatment villages221 or on instances of physical, sexual, or emotional violence in treatment households as compared to control households in treatment villages.222 In Blattman et al 2013, recipients reported a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.223 We have not seen any other rigorous evidence discussing this issue. ### Diversion of transfers to wealthier individuals. It\'s not clear to us whether this problem would be more or less of an issue in the case of cash transfers than in-kind transfers, and we would guess that the extent of the problem depends heavily on the method of making transfers. Our review of GiveDirectly discusses the extent to which this appears to have been a problem in their distributions. === Page 36 ===\n\n## Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients? We revisited the relevant evidence on this question and shared our updated analysis in November 2018. We concluded:\n\nGiveDirectly, one of our top charities, provides cash transfers to extremely low-income households. We wrote in May 2018 about new research on potential "negative spillover" effects of cash transfers: i.e., negative effects that cash transfers might have on people who live nearby transfer recipients. At that time, we wrote that we would reassess this evidence when we had results from GiveDirectly\'s "general equilibrium" (GE) study, which we expected to play a major role in our conclusions because it is the largest and highest quality study on spillover effects that we are aware of. We have now seen private draft results from the GE study. In brief, it did not find negative spillover effects of cash transfers. Considering the GE study alongside other relevant studies of the spillover effects of cash transfers, it appears that the overall evidence base is mixed.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

We also believe that our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly is relatively robust since we estimate that a large portion of the humanitarian benefit of the intervention comes from temporarily raising recipients' consumption. === Page 44 ===\n\n9/10/2020\nWe expect to reevaluate our views on cash transfers when results from a large, new study of GiveDirectly's program are released; this study will assess the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers: see General Equilibrium Effects of Cash\n\n### Transfers in Kenya, AEA RCT Registry. We also edited the negative spillovers section of this report because we believe that the previous version of this section provided too many speculative caveats on the findings of potential negative effects. We plan to revisit this evidence in the future alongside the evidence from the general equilibrium study mentioned above to consider whether we should directly factor in negative effects to our cost-effectiveness analysis. ## 2018\n\nIn this May 2018 post, we explained that we were aware of recently released research which suggested that cash transfers may be less effective than we previously believed in two ways:\n\n1. Cash may have negative spillovers on non-recipient households who live close to recipient households. 2. The benefits of cash for recipients may fade quickly over time. We conducted a more thorough literature review on the spillover effects of cash transfers and shared our updated conclusions in November 2018. We concluded that our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. For more, see the full report. We plan to address the concern about the duration of benefits at a later date because we believe it has less potential to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis for cash transfers, for reasons that are explained in this post.24\n\n=== Page 45 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nSources\n\n=== Page 46 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nFafchamps et al. 2011\n\nFiszbein and Schady 2009\n\nGertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012\n\nGilligan and Roy 2014\n\nGiveWell.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            Compare the Original Text:\n            An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2.

We owe it to each other - and our donors - to instill this confidence even though giving and receiving information candidly are unusual in both professional and social life, and can be very uncomfortable. ## 4 Create positive energy. _We strive to be a source - not drain - of energy for our colleagues._\n\nOur work is hard, practically and emotionally, and we cannot overemphasize the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, enjoying the company of our colleagues, and not taking ourselves too seriously. In doing so, we require answers and excitement amongst our colleagues in meeting. === Page 2 ===\n\n## 5. Think rigorously; act quickly. _We are intellectually rigorous with a drive towards action - not debate._\n\nWe reason from first principles, grounding our decisions in objective claims about the world, rather than hard-to-disprove assertions or hierarchy. We aim to brainstorm inclusively and respectfully, but critically self-vet ideas we put forward, so as to ensure productive and prudent decision making. Demanding this level of rigor forces us to think harder about decisions and our assumptions than we otherwise might. This is a real cost. It can be taken too far: it is possible to overthink decisions, and we avoid debate for the sake of debate. We are not here to philosophize or ensure consensus. We decide and act quickly, avoiding getting bogged down in debates. ## 6. Know yourself and grow. _We recognize and accept our imperfections with a focus on growth._\n\nWe are an organization of exceptional people and trust in each other\'s abilities, yet we recognize that none of us is perfect. We strive to maintain an accurate understanding of our individual and institutional strengths and weaknesses, in order to position ourselves to maximize our chances of success. At the same time, we seek personal growth for ourselves and our teammates. Feedback is given with a spirit of helpfulness; and sought out with a desire to learn. ## 7. Accept reality. Propose solutions. _We do not dwell on problems. We work actively to create solutions._\n\nThere will always be an endless list of things to improve. We focus on the things that can be changed; find the most important of those things, and propose actionable answers. We do not allow "problems" to weigh us down and be a source of negativity.

We owe it to each other - and our donors - to instill this confidence even though giving and receiving information candidly are unusual in both professional and social life, and can be very uncomfortable.\n  \n## 4 Create positive energy. _We strive to be a source - not drain - of energy for our colleagues._\n\nOur work is hard, practically and emotionally, and we cannot overemphasize the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, enjoying the company of our colleagues, and not taking ourselves too seriously. In doing so, we require answers and excitement amongst our colleagues in meeting.\n  \n## 5. Think rigorously; act quickly. _We are intellectually rigorous with a drive towards action - not debate._\n\nWe reason from first principles, grounding our decisions in objective claims about the world, rather than hard-to-disprove assertions or hierarchy. We aim to brainstorm inclusively and respectfully, but critically self-vet ideas we put forward, so as to ensure productive and prudent decision making. Demanding this level of rigor forces us to think harder about decisions and our assumptions than we otherwise might. This is a real cost. It can be taken too far: it is possible to overthink decisions, and we avoid debate for the sake of debate. We are not here to philosophize or ensure consensus. We decide and act quickly, avoiding getting bogged down in debates.\n  \n## 6. Know yourself and grow. _We recognize and accept our imperfections with a focus on growth._\n\nWe are an organization of exceptional people and trust in each other\'s abilities, yet we recognize that none of us is perfect. We strive to maintain an accurate understanding of our individual and institutional strengths and weaknesses, in order to position ourselves to maximize our chances of success. At the same time, we seek personal growth for ourselves and our teammates. Feedback is given with a spirit of helpfulness; and sought out with a desire to learn.\n  \n## 7. Accept reality. Propose solutions. _We do not dwell on problems. We work actively to create solutions._\n\nThere will always be an endless list of things to improve. We focus on the things that can be changed; find the most important of those things, and propose actionable answers. We do not allow "problems" to weigh us down and be a source of negativity. We are forward looking, which we believe not only leads to better team outcomes, but also creates a more enjoyable, energizing environment for all.\n  \n## 8. Be productively ambitious. _We take the risks to pursue industry-changing success, not incremental progress._\n\nWe seek step-change improvements at all levels, and are willing to make big-bets; we do not accept complacency nor do we simply optimize existing processes.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Recommendation\nNo further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria.

GiveDirectly has found a poverty rate in Homa Bay similar to that of Siaya and Rarieda. However, more people in Homa Bay have metal roofs than in Siaya. This is likely because the grass for thatched roofs does not grow in Homa Bay, so the price of thatch is less competitive. This may mean that Homa Bay residents spend a higher percentage of their income on housing.\n\n#### Return on investment (ROI) in Homa Bay\n\nBecause Homa Bay residents are less likely to spend their cash transfers on roofs, the ROI from these transfers may differ from that seen in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly is generally not focused on ROI. Its first randomized controlled trial measured a wide range of indicators (including mental health, education, child nutrition, and income), and it has not closely examined ROI.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            Compare the Original Text:\n            At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study. === Page 6 ===\n\n### Basic income guarantee study\n\nGiveDirectly would like to conduct a separate study on the effects of a basic income guarantee. The annual cash transfers involved would be smaller than those in GiveDirectly's standard program but granted consistently throughout the recipient's life.

The team, headed by Mr. Faye, consists of:\n\n* A chief of staff\n* A Vice President of engineering\n* Two full-time engineers\n* A full-time designer\n* A part-time employee in a product role\n\nSegovia's engineering team is currently working exclusively on GiveDirectly deployment. Mr. Faye and Dr. Niehaus are currently seeking Segovia's first non-GiveDirectly paying client. Segovia is not currently designed to implement programs. In the future, it may be able to offer technical assistance or implementation services. If both GiveDirectly and Segovia were offering these services, GiveDirectly would likely be more selective about the type of projects it undertakes, while Segovia would be willing to implement projects that are not designed in a way that GiveDirectly would consider optimal. Dr. Niehaus would step out of board decisions determining whether GiveDirectly should take a certain project. Segovia talks to GiveDirectly staff members Piali Mukhopadhyay, Joe Huston, and Stuart Skeates once per week, and Caroline Toth daily. Dr. Niehaus has been spending about 5-10% of his time on Segovia, which is slightly less than he had expected to spend during the past months. ### New board members\n\nGiveDirectly recently added two new board members:\n\n* Jacquelline Fuller, Director\n* Bill Meehan, Director\n\n=== Page 7 ===\n\nIt was important for GiveDirectly to find new board members who are closely aligned with GiveDirectly's vision, because decisions will likely arise for which board members who have roles at Segovia will have to step out. ### The Rarieda Randomized Control Trial (RCT)\n\nThe Rarieda RCT, which included both a $300 transfer treatment group and a $1000 transfer treatment group, did not provide strong evidence on what the best transfer size would be, because it is difficult to assess the relative value of how people use the 1000th dollar versus the 300th. There are also large confidence intervals around any of the findings based on sub-groups because of the relatively small sample size. Dr. Niehaus thinks it is unlikely $1000 is exactly the optimal size for transfers, but expects returns to be relatively flat around the $1000 mark, and so feels the costs to slight variance from the optimal transfer size are low. GiveDirectly has considered experimenting with different transfer sizes to determine the optimal amount, but feels that other research questions are more important. GiveDirectly is not concerned that recipients will run out of good ways to spend $1000 in transfer funds (e.g., purchasing an iron roof, a cow, and paying school fees for a year will use up most of a transfer). GiveDirectly also believes that while testing transfer sizes could improve its own program, it would be unlikely to affect other cash transfer programs. For example, if a government was considering providing large, one-time transfers, it would not be as concerned with whether $1000 is the right amount, but rather whether the model of large, one-time grants is effective. GiveDirectly prefers to pursue research questions that it sees as likely to influence public policy quickly (e.g., giving people control over the timing of their transfers). GiveDirectly sees the question of optimal transfer size as one that would require rigorous research to learn about, so it is not inclined to simply vary the size of its transfers as an informal experiment. It is widely accepted that periodic income transfers can reduce human suffering, but it is much less accepted that large one-time transfers can be effective ways of investing in people. There is less literature on the latter, and therefore more to be gained from researching it. Dr. Niehaus believes that some people mistakenly believe that in-kind transfers of low value can significantly change a poor person's life, when in fact it requires significant investment to lift someone out of poverty. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.\n\n### Basic income guarantee study\n\nGiveDirectly would like to conduct a separate study on the effects of a basic income guarantee.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Recommendation\nNo further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            An evaluation comprising recipient surveys, focus group discussions, and individual interviews evaluated the feasibility, reported spending, and indicative impact of $1,500 cash transfers to households impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Maria.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            No further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            ## 3 Be proactively candid. _We say what we believe, and are honest in sharing information._\n\nHaving confidence that other people are telling us what they truly believe, without gloss or omission, is critical to effective communication and to our ability to learn and grow from feedback.

In doing so, we require answers and excitement amongst our colleagues in meeting.\n  \n## 5. Think rigorously; act quickly. _We are intellectually rigorous with a drive towards action - not debate._\n\nWe reason from first principles, grounding our decisions in objective claims about the world, rather than hard-to-disprove assertions or hierarchy.

Demanding this level of rigor forces us to think harder about decisions and our assumptions than we otherwise might. This is a real cost. It can be taken too far: it is possible to overthink decisions, and we avoid debate for the sake of debate. We are not here to philosophize or ensure consensus.

We strive to maintain an accurate understanding of our individual and institutional strengths and weaknesses, in order to position ourselves to maximize our chances of success. At the same time, we seek personal growth for ourselves and our teammates. Feedback is given with a spirit of helpfulness; and sought out with a desire to learn.\n  \n## 7. Accept reality. Propose solutions. _We do not dwell on problems. We work actively to create solutions._\n\nThere will always be an endless list of things to improve. We focus on the things that can be changed; find the most important of those things, and propose actionable answers. We do not allow "problems" to weigh us down and be a source of negativity. We are forward looking, which we believe not only leads to better team outcomes, but also creates a more enjoyable, energizing environment for all.\n  \n## 8. Be productively ambitious. _We take the risks to pursue industry-changing success, not incremental progress._\n\nWe seek step-change improvements at all levels, and are willing to make big-bets; we do not accept complacency nor do we simply optimize existing processes.

If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Recommendation\nNo further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.\n\n### Basic income guarantee study\n\nGiveDirectly would like to conduct a separate study on the effects of a basic income guarantee. The annual cash transfers involved would be smaller than those in GiveDirectly's standard program but granted consistently throughout the recipient's life. GiveDirectly is interested in whether people would take greater risks if they know that their basic needs are met. This study could use the same control-group villages as the GE study.\n\n### Segovia\n\nSegovia, a new for-profit company started by GiveDirectly board member Michael Faye, with the involvement of Dr. Niehaus and GiveDirectly board member Chris Hughes, has been incorporated, received a convertible note, and will be working on Series A financing over the next few months. The team, headed by Mr. Faye, consists of:\n\n* A chief of staff\n* A Vice President of engineering\n* Two full-time engineers\n* A full-time designer\n* A part-time employee in a product role\n\nSegovia's engineering team is currently working exclusively on GiveDirectly deployment. Mr. Faye and Dr. Niehaus are currently seeking Segovia's first non-GiveDirectly paying client. Segovia is not currently designed to implement programs. In the future, it may be able to offer technical assistance or implementation services. If both GiveDirectly and Segovia were offering these services, GiveDirectly would likely be more selective about the type of projects it undertakes, while Segovia would be willing to implement projects that are not designed in a way that GiveDirectly would consider optimal. Dr. Niehaus would step out of board decisions determining whether GiveDirectly should take a certain project. Segovia talks to GiveDirectly staff members Piali Mukhopadhyay, Joe Huston, and Stuart Skeates once per week, and Caroline Toth daily. Dr. Niehaus has been spending about 5-10% of his time on Segovia, which is slightly less than he had expected to spend during the past months.\n\n### New board members\n\nGiveDirectly recently added two new board members:\n\n* Jacquelline Fuller, Director\n* Bill Meehan, Director\n\nIt was important for GiveDirectly to find new board members who are closely aligned with GiveDirectly's vision, because decisions will likely arise for which board members who have roles at Segovia will have to step out.\n\n### The Rarieda Randomized Control Trial (RCT)\n\nThe Rarieda RCT, which included both a $300 transfer treatment group and a $1000 transfer treatment group, did not provide strong evidence on what the best transfer size would be, because it is difficult to assess the relative value of how people use the 1000th dollar versus the 300th. There are also large confidence intervals around any of the findings based on sub-groups because of the relatively small sample size. Dr. Niehaus thinks it is unlikely $1000 is exactly the optimal size for transfers, but expects returns to be relatively flat around the $1000 mark, and so feels the costs to slight variance from the optimal transfer size are low. GiveDirectly has considered experimenting with different transfer sizes to determine the optimal amount, but feels that other research questions are more important. GiveDirectly is not concerned that recipients will run out of good ways to spend $1000 in transfer funds (e.g., purchasing an iron roof, a cow, and paying school fees for a year will use up most of a transfer). GiveDirectly also believes that while testing transfer sizes could improve its own program, it would be unlikely to affect other cash transfer programs. For example, if a government was considering providing large, one-time transfers, it would not be as concerned with whether $1000 is the right amount, but rather whether the model of large, one-time grants is effective. GiveDirectly prefers to pursue research questions that it sees as likely to influence public policy quickly (e.g., giving people control over the timing of their transfers). GiveDirectly sees the question of optimal transfer size as one that would require rigorous research to learn about, so it is not inclined to simply vary the size of its transfers as an informal experiment. It is widely accepted that periodic income transfers can reduce human suffering, but it is much less accepted that large one-time transfers can be effective ways of investing in people. There is less literature on the latter, and therefore more to be gained from researching it. Dr. Niehaus believes that some people mistakenly believe that in-kind transfers of low value can significantly change a poor person's life, when in fact it requires significant investment to lift someone out of poverty. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study. === Page 6 ===\n\n### Basic income guarantee study\n\nGiveDirectly would like to conduct a separate study on the effects of a basic income guarantee.

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Page Label Removal\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 1 ===\n\nWe\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively.

The following notes include an overview of the Dispensers for Safe Water program and the chronology of its development, as well as DSW's explanation of its process, from how it chooses areas in which to work to the continuing operational support it provides. GiveWell and Good Ventures also visited two of DSW's chlorine dispensers and talked with members of the community who were collecting water. Our notes from those visits are included in this document as well. **Note:** This is a set of summary notes compiled by GiveWell in order to give an overview of the major points made by DSW in our conversations. **Overview of Dispensers for Safe Water**\n\nInnovation for Poverty Action's (IPA's) project, Dispensers for Safe Water, installs chlorine dispensers near water collection points. Chlorine is dispensed at the source, stays in the water and continues to neutralize bacteria for a period of up to three days after the time of treatment, which addresses the issue of contamination between source and consumption. Each chlorine dispenser issues a pre-set amount of chlorine (3 mL) that is sufficient to treat about 20 liters of water, the amount held by a standard size jerry can that is commonly used for water in the villages in which DSW works. IPA has already installed 2,000 chlorine dispensers, providing access to 400,000 people. In the area that encompasses all of these dispensers, there may be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 dispensers per square kilometer. DSW has plans to add 1,000-1,100 more dispensers in Western Kenya by February 2013. Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality. **Chronology of DSW**\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nWith water source improvement interventions, the main problems are that while water quality is improved at the source, a) in some cases, not all contamination is significantly reduced and b) many of those gains are lost at the household level because of recontamination during transport and storage, which limits the reduction in diarrhea rates. So then the question becomes, how can you improve water quality at the household level? IPA began water research in Kenya about 10 years ago to address this question. Chlorine stays in water for 1-3 days, depending on how the water is stored. This is one of big reasons to focus on chlorine - the residual effect. The way this works is that chlorine continues to bind to and neutralize organic matter and bacteria in water for as long as it has excess capacity. There is variation in the measured effects of chlorine, but on average it has been found to reduce diarrhea rates by 40%, and it is inexpensive. This number is approximate, because most data on diarrhea relies on care-givers' reports of children's illness. But chlorine decreases the contamination of water, and there is a strong case that contaminants like E. Coli and Rotavirus cause illnesses. As for why chlorine should be provided for free, studies have shown a low willingness to pay for water treatment products. One study conducted in western Kenya examined price sensitivity to bottled chlorine products sold through retail outlets. It found that charging above $0 dramatically decreased uptake. After an RCT of chlorine dispensers from 2006-2007 showed initial promising results, 20 dispensers were installed, serving a total of 3000-4000 people. From March 2009-July 2012 IPA launched multiple pilots of chlorine dispenser programs. In these pilots, IPA has partnered with a variety of government institutions, as well as explored different models of dispensers and approaches to supply chain management, promotion efforts, forms of delivery, and getting the buy in of the people involved. During this time, there were also multiple RCTs run. These studies assessed various aspects of chlorination programs, including community financing, promoter monitoring and incentives, and how public officials make decisions about the provision of public goods. DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%,and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches. For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water. === Page 3 ===\n\nAt baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%. After the dispensers were installed in the first RCT study of dispensers, 50-60% of people were treating their water, and this was verified up to 4 years after installation. **Evolution of dispensers**\n\nOver time, DSW has tried out a number of different dispenser models. Chlorine dispensers are now made of plastic. In 2010 and before, dispensers were made of metal. One issue with earlier models was that metal (especially the metal paddocks used) tended to corrode; now the containers and paddocks have been replaced with more corrosion-resistant materials. Note that when GiveWell/Good Ventures visited the IPA office in Kisumu, we saw a number of examples of dispensers that were tried out and replaced with newer versions. **Costs to implement dispensers for safe water**\n\nDSW breaks down the direct implementation costs into 2 buckets:\n\n1. Initial implementation (from the decision to install dispensers through the installation, including materials, community education, transportation, staff time, etc.) costs $200/chlorine dispenser; this will go down over time. 2. Ongoing operations (ensuring that the dispensers continue to function and increasing the rate at which they are used) are projected to cost $65/dispenser/year at scale. This includes chlorine supply, maintenance, hardware replacement after its projected lifespan, M&E, management costs and all overheads. **DSW implementation process**\n\n1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density. 2. **Meet local stakeholders from the district to location-level governments. **\n3. **Meet with local leaders** (e.g., church leaders, village elders) to discuss the possibility of installing dispensers. These officials provide lists of all water points in the areas they represent. 4. **Select the water points at which DSW will work. **\n5. **Host community meetings in areas that DSW has selected**. The meeting is advertised by calling village elders, posting notices, announcements by megaphone, and by meeting with a couple villagers initially and asking them to tell others about the meeting. Community meetings serve to sensitize the community members to the program and inform them of the benefits of chlorine, as well as to ask if they are ready to have the program (to formally secure their\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nbuy in). At community meetings, DSW staff explain how to use the chlorine dispensers to treat water, address any problems people raise, and collect phone numbers of community members for use when DSW sends text messages to promote the use of the dispensers. DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it. 6. **Choose water points for dispensers. ** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria. 7. **Install the dispensers. **\n8. **Host a smaller meeting at each water point** where a dispenser was installed so that people can see it and be reminded of how to treat their water. 9. **Attendees of this meeting elect a person from the village to be the official chlorine dispenser promoter** by show of hands or secret ballot. The promoters are charged with refilling dispensers with the chlorine supplies that DSW delivers, ensuring the dispenser is in working order, communicating any issues to DSW staff, and reaching out to people to encourage them to use the dispenser. Promoters are given chlorine dispenser promoter T-shirts, and are sometimes given a small gift such as $1 of phone credit per month, but in the past have otherwise been unpaid. DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water. 10. **Provide services for ongoing operation** of each water point: chlorine supply, fixing malfunctioning dispensers, marketing to increase uptake, monitoring and evaluation (DSW conducts 2-month, 4-month and 12-month evaluations for the 2100 dispensers it has installed) DSW's field work is done by field associates who collect data, hold community meetings, etc, and by community field assistants who deliver the chlorine. DSW also has an area coordinator and associate area coordinator, to whom the field staff report. They in turn report to the Operations Manager. Field visits for chlorine delivery currently occur about every 3 months, but DSW is exploring reducing visits to 2-3 times per year. === Page 5 ===\n\nThe field associates visit a sample of households using the chlorine dispenser, and test for levels of chlorine present in stored household drinking water. [We did not discuss the results in depth during this meeting]. DSW also collects survey data in addition to monitoring chlorine levels. **Observations from visit to chlorine dispenser sites**\n\nWe visited two chlorine dispensers installed at water points located close together (no more than a half mile apart), in a rural area of Busia. We had the opportunity to speak with the DSW promoter at the first spring. The spring was protected in 2009 (spring protection involves building a cement structure to encase the spring area and inserting pipes to channel spring water. This prevents water from the spring becoming mixed with contaminants from the pooling water around it before it is collected). The promoter at the first dispenser site told us that about 300 people collect water from this spring, and DSW told us that the usage rate at this location was 33% (meaning that during the last random visit to this spring, 33% of the households sampled had detectable chlorine in their stored drinking water). The promoter said that he comes to the spring weekly to encourage people to use the chlorine.\n</text to be cleaned>\n", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Topics discussed in this conversation include Mr. Skeates\' previous work experience and future work responsibilities at GiveDirectly, changes implemented in response to the case of staff fraud in Uganda, and various issues that can compromise the success of GiveDirectly\'s work. ### About Stuart Skeates\n\nStuart Skeates is GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director. Prior to his role at GiveDirectly, Mr. Skeates was at McKinsey & Company, where he worked with the government of Ethiopia on energy and water projects. ### Mr. Skeates\' work plan in 2015\n\nAround early November 2014, Mr. Skeates will transition from working full time in Uganda as the Field Director to being based out of GiveDirectly\'s Kenya office. Mr. Skeates will still spend one week per month in Mbale, Uganda, to oversee the ongoing Uganda 2M campaign. In total, he expects to spend one third of his time on work specific to Uganda. The other two thirds of his time will be spent on miscellaneous projects, including:\n\n* Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly\'s program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs. * Assisting Joe Huston, GiveDirectly Kenya Field Director, with some of GiveDirectly\'s research projects. Mr. Skeates is planning to supervise data collection for the behavioral study. * Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households. * Helping with the deployment of Segovia technology. ### Changes implemented in response to staff fraud\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nIn the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:\n\n* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents. * Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents. * Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) for their time during a cash out day. * Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient\'s phone after the recipient passed away. * Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale. * Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly. * Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent\'s account. For more on the staff fraud, see this blog post that GiveDirectly published after our site visit: https://www.givedirectly.org/blog_post.php?id=6720123171950519215 (archived version available here: http://www.webcitation.org/6TwrteHbT). ## Issues\n\n### Security of phones and mobile money accounts\n\nSome recipients, especially elderly ones, have to learn how to use cell phones for the first time in order to manage the GiveDirectly transfers in mobile money accounts. These people have a more difficult time understanding how to keep their phones secure; for example, they often keep the phone in its original packaging and do not conceal it. Another problem with security is that some recipients will share the PIN numbers for their mobile money accounts, either intentionally or unintentionally by handing the phone to a mobile money agent before pressing "Send" (so the PIN number is still apparent on the screen of the phone.) This makes recipients more vulnerable to people who wanted to steal money from their accounts. Teaching PIN saftey has long been a priority, and GiveDirectly has added additional emphasis on the topic (e.g.,\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\nemphasis during village meetings, additional trainings given by the mobile provider) Improved security is a reason why GiveDirectly is interested in piloting biometric authentication for mobile money accounts, though it does not currently have plans to do so. ### Increased gaming\n\nOne village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there was also one village with high levels of gaming. GiveDirectly mentioned two possible contributing factors: 1) the village was close to another village that had already received transfers, so it is likely that there was a higher level of awareness of GiveDirectly\'s targeting criteria at the outset, enabling people to pose as meeting the criteria from the census stage; 2) evidence that a corrupt staff member planted a false recipient in the village. ### Theft\n\nThere are cases of theft from individual recipients. Most of the theft of transfers is happening from within villages, rather than external people coming to the villages to steal funds. ### Transfer size\n\nIn 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            ## Conversation with Stuart Skeates of GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014\n\n### Participants\n\n* Stuart Skeates - Uganda Field Director, GiveDirectly\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Josh Rosenberg - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n### Note: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by GiveDirectly. ### Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director, while visiting GiveDirectly in Uganda.

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

We asked why the dispenser was placed in this position rather than in a place that people would be able to access it more easily, but there was not a clear reason. DSW explained that this was one of their earlier pilots, and clearer placement instructions for dispenser installation staff had been put in place since then. DSW also explained that people are instructed to add chlorine to their containers first so as to avoid having to lift 20 liters of water while standing across the spring.

We spent less time at the second chlorine dispenser location. People in this area were collecting water from multiple points along an above ground stream, as well as from a protected spring. The dispenser was placed several yards (at least 4) away from any of these collection points, and appeared to be removed from where most people were gathered. DSW staff told us that they considered this to be a poorly designed dispenser installation, and improved placement guidelines after this dispenser was installed.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text.

For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nWe have seen five studies examining the extent to which people invest their cash transfers, leading to longer-term gains:\n\n**Gertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012** is a followup of a randomized rollout of the Oportunidades program in Mexico, in which the treatment group was randomly selected to receive conditional cash transfers a year and a half earlier than the control group. It finds that people in the treatment group saw faster increases in their ownership of farm assets like land, started more microenterprises-"mainly production of handcrafts for sale"-and ultimately saw ~5% higher consumption levels than those in the control group, even four years after the latter had been enrolled in the program.59 The authors estimate that 74% of transfers are consumed and 26% are invested, an estimate that we discuss in more depth below.60 They go on to say:61\n\nNote that our estimate of the [marginal propensity to consume] MPC is consistent with other estimates in developing countries. For example, Musgrove (1979) estimates MPCs of 0.881 for urban Colombia, 0.896 for urban Ecuador, and, 0.776 for urban Peru; and Bhalla (1979) reports an MPC of 0.61 for rural India. Moreover, its value is relatively high, which is suggestive that beneficiaries are perceiving the program as a permanent --as opposed to transitory--source of income: Paxson (1992) reports MPCs out of permanent income from 0.56 to 0.84, and MPCs out of transitory income ranging from 0.17 to 0.27 for a sample of rice farmers in Thailand. A randomized evaluation of the Nicaraguan _Red de Proteccion Social_, a conditional cash transfer program, did not find any change in investment (except in human capital) due to the cash transfers.62 However, the authors note that, "households are indeed following the recommendations of the program; that is, they are spending most of their income from the program on current (food and education) expenditures. "63\n\n=== Page 12 ===\n\nA randomized evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), an ongoing unconditional cash transfer program, found that 87% of the transfer was consumed.64 The remaining 13% is not accounted for by the study, but the authors speculate that it may be invested.65 It could also have been saved (without investment), transferred to other individuals, or simply mismeasured.66 In a randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Sri Lanka, recipients reported that 58% of their unconditional grants were immediately invested in the business, another 12% was saved, and the remaining 30% was spent on household consumption, investment, or other uses.67 Measures of the impact of the grants on capital stock show more dramatic effects, suggesting that cash grants increase capital stock for the recipient\'s micro-enterprise by as much as 100% of the grant amount.68 A similar randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Ghana estimated that cash grants to women increased household spending by 50-80% of their value during the quarter following grant receipt and cash grants to men increased household spending by 33-50% of their value, though the estimate for men was not statistically significant. The variation in estimated spending, especially amongst women, arises from very high levels of household spending amongst relatively few individuals, though the results for women remain significant after truncating at various levels.69 The estimated effects of the cash grants on business capital stock were not statistically significant, but varied between roughly one third and one half of the transfer value for women and between roughly zero and 20% of the transfer value for men, depending on whether full or truncated values were used.70 Note, though, that the cash transfers by GiveDirectly are both larger and made to poorer individuals than any of the transfers discussed above: Economic theory and the citations quoted above from Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) suggest that larger, shorter term transfers are more likely to be invested than smaller, ongoing transfers, and comparing the results from the\n\n=== Page 13 ===\n\nongoing cash transfers and the business grants appears to bear this conclusion out, though the estimates overlap significantly. However, there is also a potential tradeoff with beneficiary wealth: poorer recipients are typically expected to consume more of a cash transfer, relative to wealthier individuals. This coincides with our worry that GiveDirectly\'s focus on targeting the poorest may be systematically targeting individuals who are less likely to invest or, if they do invest, to reap large returns. ## What return on investment do cash-transfer recipients earn? _Note: the section below was originally published in December 2012. In September-October 2013, we searched for additional literature on this topic (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in which recipients earned substantially smaller returns. Two other new studies found high returns from unconditional cash grants with features encouraging investment.78 In November 2013, we updated this section to include results from these three studies._\n\n## A variant of GiveDirectly\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.72 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.73 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.74\n\n=== Page 14 ===\n\nGiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.77 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.78 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is discussed in much more detail below. ### Unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTwo studies of unconditional wealth transfers in Uganda both found high annual returns of 30%-39% on the original grant.79 Both of these programs included many features designed to encourage investment and improve returns, which distinguish them from GiveDirectly\'s intervention. The studies are discussed in more detail below. ### Conditional cash transfers\n\n=== Page 15 ===\n\nThe only randomized controlled trial of ongoing cash transfers that discusses the returns that recipients earn on their investments is based on the Dportunidades conditional cash transfer program in Mexico, described above.80 Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that, four years after the control group began to receive treatment and five and a half years after the treatment group began to receive transfers, the treatment group continued to have consumption 5.6% higher than the control group.81 This implies, by our calculation, a 1.7% monthly return, and a 21% annual return, on the transfers,82 which further implies a 3.6% monthly, and 42.6% annual, rate of return on investment.83 Using a different method, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that for every hundred dollars transferred more than two years ago, recipients continue to earn $1.60 per month in additional income, for an annual return of 19.2%, even though they estimate that only 26% of transfers are invested.84 Since only 26% of transfers are invested, this implies an even higher rate of return on _investments_, of roughly 75% per year, or 6% per month.85 In these calculations, the authors do not rely purely on the randomized comparison between the treatment and control group. Instead, they estimate current consumption as a result of current and past cumulative transfers, which depend both on the randomized roll-out of the program, and on the number, age, gender, and school attendance of the children in a family. While the number, age, and gender of children are plausibly exogenous (i.e. they are not influenced by current consumption), and thus can just be included in the regressions as controls, the school attendance of children in the family is endogenous: worse school attendance is likely to lead to both decreased transfers (since the conditions punish families for not sending children to school) and increased consumption, since children not in school may be more likely to work. For exogenous variation in the transfers, the authors use instruments consisting of the _maximum amount of transfers that the family could have received_ had their children had perfect attendance.86 This explains a large portion of the variation in actual transfers received, and is likely exogenous (i.e. maximum potential transfers are\n\n=== Page 16 ===\n\nlikely "as good as random" once family demographics are controlled for, and family demographics are likely not influenced by consumption). Regressing current consumption on the current transfers and cumulative transfers from previous years, the authors estimate that every $100 in current transfers translates into an additional $48.70 of reported spending during the past month, and every $100 in transfers from more than 2 years ago translates into an additional $1.50 of reported spending during the past month.87 However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the total effect because many students worked, causing both a reduction in transfers for them relative to the maximum possible and an increase in consumption for their families (through their wages).88 By assuming that maximum potential transfers influence current consumption only through actually received transfers, which seems plausible, (i.e. by using maximum potential transfers as an instrument for actual transfers) the authors estimate that $100 of actually received transfers this month increases consumption by $74, and $100 of actually received transfers from more than two years ago increases consumption this month by $1.60.89\n\nThe authors pursue this instrumental variables strategy, rather than just regressing current consumption on total realized transfers, because the realized transfers are negatively correlated with consumption because of the child labor effects of conditionality, which would lead to an underestimate of the effects of transfers. The three different estimates discussed for long-term annual returns on cash transfers are quite similar (20.4%, 18%, 19.2%), though the estimated returns on _investment_ differ significantly (42.6%, 35%, 73.8%), because of different estimates of how much of the transfers are consumed. ## Business grants\n\nThese estimated returns seem quite high, but there is a separate literature on the returns to capital in micro-enterprises that is relevant to this issue. In a series of experiments in Sri Lanka, Mexico, and Ghana, researchers giving grants on the order\n\n=== Page 17 ===\n\nof $100 to micro-enterprises without any paid employees have found high returns on investment, in the range of 6%-46% _per month_.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of_GiveDirectly\'s program. For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below.\n\nWe have seen five studies examining the extent to which people invest their cash transfers, leading to longer-term gains:\n\n**Gertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012** is a followup of a randomized rollout of the Oportunidades program in Mexico, in which the treatment group was randomly selected to receive conditional cash transfers a year and a half earlier than the control group. It finds that people in the treatment group saw faster increases in their ownership of farm assets like land, started more microenterprises-"mainly production of handcrafts for sale"-and ultimately saw ~5% higher consumption levels than those in the control group, even four years after the latter had been enrolled in the program.59 The authors estimate that 74% of transfers are consumed and 26% are invested, an estimate that we discuss in more depth below.60 They go on to say:61\n\nNote that our estimate of the [marginal propensity to consume] MPC is consistent with other estimates in developing countries. For example, Musgrove (1979) estimates MPCs of 0.881 for urban Colombia, 0.896 for urban Ecuador, and, 0.776 for urban Peru; and Bhalla (1979) reports an MPC of 0.61 for rural India. Moreover, its value is relatively high, which is suggestive that beneficiaries are perceiving the program as a permanent --as opposed to transitory--source of income: Paxson (1992) reports MPCs out of permanent income from 0.56 to 0.84, and MPCs out of transitory income ranging from 0.17 to 0.27 for a sample of rice farmers in Thailand. A randomized evaluation of the Nicaraguan _Red de Proteccion Social_, a conditional cash transfer program, did not find any change in investment (except in human capital) due to the cash transfers.62 However, the authors note that, "households are indeed following the recommendations of the program; that is, they are spending most of their income from the program on current (food and education) expenditures. "63\n\nA randomized evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), an ongoing unconditional cash transfer program, found that 87% of the transfer was consumed.64 The remaining 13% is not accounted for by the study, but the authors speculate that it may be invested.65 It could also have been saved (without investment), transferred to other individuals, or simply mismeasured.66 In a randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Sri Lanka, recipients reported that 58% of their unconditional grants were immediately invested in the business, another 12% was saved, and the remaining 30% was spent on household consumption, investment, or other uses.67 Measures of the impact of the grants on capital stock show more dramatic effects, suggesting that cash grants increase capital stock for the recipient\'s micro-enterprise by as much as 100% of the grant amount.68 A similar randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Ghana estimated that cash grants to women increased household spending by 50-80% of their value during the quarter following grant receipt and cash grants to men increased household spending by 33-50% of their value, though the estimate for men was not statistically significant. The variation in estimated spending, especially amongst women, arises from very high levels of household spending amongst relatively few individuals, though the results for women remain significant after truncating at various levels.69 The estimated effects of the cash grants on business capital stock were not statistically significant, but varied between roughly one third and one half of the transfer value for women and between roughly zero and 20% of the transfer value for men, depending on whether full or truncated values were used.70 Note, though, that the cash transfers by GiveDirectly are both larger and made to poorer individuals than any of the transfers discussed above: Economic theory and the citations quoted above from Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) suggest that larger, shorter term transfers are more likely to be invested than smaller, ongoing transfers, and comparing the results from the ongoing cash transfers and the business grants appears to bear this conclusion out, though the estimates overlap significantly. However, there is also a potential tradeoff with beneficiary wealth: poorer recipients are typically expected to consume more of a cash transfer, relative to wealthier individuals. This coincides with our worry that GiveDirectly\'s focus on targeting the poorest may be systematically targeting individuals who are less likely to invest or, if they do invest, to reap large returns.\n\n## What return on investment do cash-transfer recipients earn?\n\n_Note: the section below was originally published in December 2012. In September-October 2013, we searched for additional literature on this topic (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in which recipients earned substantially smaller returns. Two other new studies found high returns from unconditional cash grants with features encouraging investment.78 In November 2013, we updated this section to include results from these three studies._\n\n## A variant of GiveDirectly\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.72 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.73 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.74\n\nGiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.77 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.78 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is discussed in much more detail below.\n\n### Unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTwo studies of unconditional wealth transfers in Uganda both found high annual returns of 30%-39% on the original grant.79 Both of these programs included many features designed to encourage investment and improve returns, which distinguish them from GiveDirectly\'s intervention.

We attempted to combine the results from these studies and create a model of the magnitude of possible spillover effects. However, we did not feel comfortable relying on this model because we lack basic information on a number of key parameters, such as how many non-recipient households may be affected by spillover effects for each treated household and how the magnitude of spillover effects changes with\n\n=== Page 37 ===\n\ndistance. We would revisit this explicit model if further academic analysis is able to shed light on these parameters. In the meantime, our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. We believe potential negative spillover effects of GiveDirectly\'s program are likely to be minimal on net for a number of reasons, including: the largest and highest quality study (the GE study) found no evidence of negative spillovers, and we have not seen strong evidence on the mechanisms for large negative spillover effects. However, given that negative spillover effects via inflation are theoretically plausible, and given that three studies find evidence of negative spillovers, we do include a small negative discount in our cost-effectiveness analysis for this concern. We emphasize that our conclusion at this point is very tentative, and we hope to update our views next year if there is more public discussion or research on the areas of uncertainty highlighted in our analysis. For more, see our full report on this question. ## What versions of the intervention are best? We have reviewed one RCT comparing physical cash transfers with electronic transfers to a recipient\'s cell phone.224 The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash. Had the study continued longer, the cheaper ongoing costs of the cell phone transfer mechanism would have made up for the higher initial costs.225 The study also finds that recipients of the cell phone transfer recipients had to walk less than 25% as far, on average, as those who received physical cash in order to "cash out" their transfers (0.9 vs. 4.04 km).226 The cell phone transfers also appear to have\n\n=== Page 38 ===\n\nincreased the diversity of crops grown and consumed by people who received them, relative to the "placebo" group that just received physical transfers and a cell phone.227\n\nThe study did not find any adverse effects of using cell phone transfers relative to handing out physical cash. ## 2012\n\nInitially, we conducted searches on JSTOR and Google Scholar for terms related to cash transfers, especially seeking out systematic reviews, and tracing citations in order to find randomized trials. We relied particularly heavily on two major literature reviews in our research on CCTs: a World Bank review228 and a Cochrane review.229 Of the literature reviews that we found, we relied on these two because they included a high percentage of RCTs and they presented the data from the studies clearly. We also searched the World Bank DIME database for relevant studies, discussed with GiveDirectly staff, and added studies as they arose in the process of drafting and updating this report. ## 2013\n\nMany new studies on cash transfers have been published since December 2012. For this update we have not attempted to thoroughly read all new research published on\n\n=== Page 39 ===\n\ncash transfers over the course of the last year. We focused on a recently released RCT of a variation on GiveDirectly\'s program in Kenya.230\n\nWe also looked for RCTs with evidence on programs that were unconditional, large, wealth transfers (the approach taken by GiveDirectly) and research that appeared most likely to affect our views of the evidence for this intervention. We relied heavily on studies and commentary on cash transfers that were sent to us by people who follow GiveWell. We also looked at the abstracts of studies cited by two papers by Chris Blattman231, which reported results from experiments involving large, unconditional cash transfers. In addition, we searched Google Scholar for studies with "cash transfers" in the title from 2011-2013. We listed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cash transfers in a spreadsheet and read the abstract for all studies to try to identify studies that might change our views on the intervention. We also looked for evidence on the propensity to invest cash transfers, returns to investment, inflation, economic effects on non-recipients, spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients. ## Changes in our views\n\nIn general, the additional evidence we reviewed did not substantively change our assessment of the impact of cash transfers. We found little evidence that cash transfers caused inflation, negative economic effects on non-recipients, recipient spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients. The most significant updates to the evidence are results from a randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in Western Kenya. These results are broadly consistent with results measured in other cash transfer programs, but do\n\n=== Page 40 ===\n\nsuggest that GiveDirectly recipients may earn lower investment returns on their transfers than recipients in previously studied cash transfer programs. These results are particularly significant because they assess GiveDirectly\'s program itself. We continue to interpret other evidence for cash transfers cautiously, as most research examines programs that differ from GiveDirectly in that: 1) the transfers are conditional or framed heavily in terms of investment; 2) the transfers are 60% to 90% smaller than GiveDirectly\'s; 3) trainings or other services are provided alongside the transfers. We are not aware of any other studies of the propensity to invest large wealth transfers that were not framed as business grants, restricted to participants with investment proposals and/or provided alongside some form of business training or technical assistance. ### Studies we considered\n\nA list of the studies reviewed for our initial report in 2012 is available above. A list of the research on cash transfers that we have seen between December 2012 and December 2013 is available at this footnote.232\n\nThis list includes all new RCTs we have seen but does not attempt to comprehensively list every non-RCT that has been published, instead focusing on studies most likely to affect our views. ## 2014\n\nWe reviewed a list of studies and articles on cash transfers that we\'d come across or were sent to us throughout the year and conducted an informal search for additional studies that might substantively change our view on cash transfers. We did not find any study that passed that threshold and continue to rely on the studies identified in\n\n=== Page 41 ===\n\nour last review. We think that (a) studies of large, unrestricted cash transfers or (b) studies that rigorously examine the negative effects of cash transfers could potentially change our view. ## 2015\n\nWe primarily searched for new studies on (a) large, unconditional cash transfers and/or (b) the negative effects of cash transfers because we think these are the types of studies that would be most likely to affect our view of GiveDirectly\'s program. ### New studies on large, unconditional cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on large, unconditional cash transfers, we (a) searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 that contained the keywords "Haushofer and Shapiro 2013" (without the quotes) or "GiveDirectly", (b) reviewed studies mentioned in a section of a World Bank blog post on education and cash transfers and (c) reviewed a list of studies sent to us by Paul Niehaus of GiveDirectly. We identified the following papers as warranting further investigation, but all of the studies differed enough from GiveDirectly\'s program that they did not substantively change our view:233\n\nHarris 2015 is an observational study comparing households in Ethiopia that received very large cash transfers (5x annual consumption expenditure on average) as compensation for the government taking a substantial portion of their land (70% on average) to households that did not get their land taken away.234\n\nBlattman, Jamison and Sheridan 2015 randomly assigned $200 grants (about 3 months wages) to criminally engaged Liberian men (some also received therapy).235\n\nEmergency Economics 2014 examined a program that provided cash transfers ($575 USD per household over 5 months) to Syrian refugees in Lebanon during the winter.236\n\nWe also found a published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) whereas we previously relied on the policy report (Blattman et al 2013). The updated analysis did\n\n=== Page 42 ===\n\nnot substantively change our view, but we have added a small update from the new analysis about the effects of WINGS on non-participating households in the relevant section above. Finally, we examined a pilot study run by GiveDirectly, which they had previously sent to us, that randomized young women to receive large, unconditional transfers.237 This pilot study did not substantively change our view because it had a very small sample size, differed from GiveDirectly\'s core program, and did not seem to analyze return on investment of transfers.238\n\n## New studies on the negative effects of cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on the negative effects of cash transfers, we searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 with "cash randomized, "cash randomised", "cash experimental", or "cash experiment" (all without the quotes) in the title. We culled the studies based on their titles.239 We skimmed the 5 remaining studies for discussion on any negative effects of the transfer programs.240 We identified one of the studies (White and Basu 2014) as warranting further investigation (based on a cursory look, none of the other studies reported negative effects). White and Basu 2014, which examined the effect of change in payment schedule for a cash transfer program in Peru on expenditures on temptation goods, did not substantively change our view because it did not, in our view, find meaningfully negative effects (see following footnote for details).241\n\nWe also looked for discussion of negative effects in the new studies of large, unconditional transfers that we identified as warranting further investigation. None of the studies reported findings on negative effects that substantively changed our view because either (a) they did not find meaningfully negative effects of transfers, or (b) the potential negative effects seemed to be unlikely to apply to GiveDirectly\'s program.242\n\nHaushofer, Reisinger and Shapiro 2015 was released after we finished the search described above. We wrote up our view of the study. For more information on our search for studies, see this spreadsheet. === Page 43 ===\n\n## Other studies\n\nWe de-prioritized further investigation of two RCTs examining the effect of cash transfers on cognitive development (Barham, Macours and Maluccio 2013 and Gilligan and Roy 2014), because it seemed that the conditionality (or perceived conditionality) of the transfers in both studies played a key role in the outcomes, which makes these studies less relevant to GiveDirectly\'s unconditional transfer program.243\n\n## 2017\n\nThroughout the year we tracked new literature that might be relevant to assessing the impact of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfer program by:\n\nSetting up alerts so that we were notified whenever new studies cited key studies such as Haushofer and Shapiro 2013. Reviewing papers that were sent to us or that were discussed by various development economics blogs and social media accounts that we follow. We did not find any studies that we thought warranted deeper investigation at this time. We would conduct a deeper investigation of a cash transfer study if, based on the abstract, it seemed that it might provide high-quality information about the humanitarian impacts of unconditional cash transfers in contexts similar to those in which GiveDirectly operates.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            Of the five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which look at the spillover effects of unconditional cash transfers on consumption in sub-Saharan African countries, three RCTs find substantial negative spillover effects, one RCT finds no spillover effects, and the GE study finds no or even a small positive spillover effect. We attempted to combine the results from these studies and create a model of the magnitude of possible spillover effects. However, we did not feel comfortable relying on this model because we lack basic information on a number of key parameters, such as how many non-recipient households may be affected by spillover effects for each treated household and how the magnitude of spillover effects changes with distance. We would revisit this explicit model if further academic analysis is able to shed light on these parameters. In the meantime, our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. We believe potential negative spillover effects of GiveDirectly\'s program are likely to be minimal on net for a number of reasons, including: the largest and highest quality study (the GE study) found no evidence of negative spillovers, and we have not seen strong evidence on the mechanisms for large negative spillover effects.

Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            Compare the Original Text:\n            However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households. #### Mobile money partnership\n\nGiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\npossible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located. #### Kenya\n\n#### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly has nearly exhausted its ability to enroll households in Siaya County, although it would be possible to treat the control group in Siaya from the General Equilibrium (GE) study. The control households make up slightly less than half the eligible households in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly wants to maintain the Siaya control group as a control for long-term follow-up purposes, and it does not anticipate problems getting further approvals from the Kenyan government for work elsewhere. GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward. #### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison. In about two months, GiveDirectly expects to have more details about the study design and which program will be compared to cash transfers. In the future, GiveDirectly may invest its own funding in Rwanda for other cash transfer campaigns, but this depends largely on the total amount of funding it receives and on how GiveDirectly's work in Rwanda progresses. #### Modified criteria for eligibility\n\nThe presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed. === Page 7 ===\n\nGiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well. GiveDirectly has found that different groups of respondents give very different answers, or that the same respondents will give very different answers on multiple tests. ### Trustee and helper system\n\nTo help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipient whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs. A helper is a position of lower responsibility. Helpers may be chosen for recipients who are very old or blind. The transfer can thus be registered in the recipient's name, but the helper retrieves the transfer or assists the recipient in using the phone. ### Security risks\n\n#### Risk of targeting for robbery on cashout days\n\nLarge volumes of cash brought into villages on cashout days, making them a possible target for robbery. However, the banks or mobile money providers that GiveDirectly works with provide armored vehicles, security personnel, and valuable cash handling expertise for the cash out days. #### Risk due to increased prominence\n\nGiveDirectly does not anticipate increased risk of robbery as it becomes better known in the areas where it works. In Siaya in Kenya, GiveDirectly was extremely well known, so it seems unlikely that criminal activity in new areas where GiveDirectly is less recognized would be greater than it was in Siaya. However, likelihood of crime might vary from region to region. GiveDirectly does not consider security risk to be very high in Homa Bay County, but acknowledges that it could be more of a concern in an urban area. One of the benefits of the distributed cashout model is that it makes it easier to keep recipients' identities secret and therefore limit the potential for robbery. As part of its follow-up procedure, GiveDirectly asks recipients security-related questions,\n\n=== Page 8 ===\n\nsuch as whether anyone knows that they are recipients and knew when they went to cash out, to monitor security risk. _Policy on reimbursing stolen transfers_\n\nWhen theft of a transfer occurs that is out of GiveDirectly's control, GiveDirectly generally does not reimburse the recipient, although it will try to help recover the money by negotiating with the thief or involving the police or local government. ### Impact of research studies on GiveDirectly's activities\n\n#### Approach to incorporating research studies\n\nA large number of GiveDirectly's enrollees are now participants in one of several ongoing research studies. The model for some of these studies may be significantly different from GiveDirectly's regular campaigns (i.e., the transfer amounts may be higher or lower). When a study's model deviates significantly from the way GiveDirectly publicly presents its campaigns, GiveDirectly finds an independent source of funding and does not use any retail donations to finance the study. For example, one study was funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The ideas42 study, which also represented a substantial deviation from GiveDirectly's core model, was also independently funded. Examples of retail donation-funded research projects are the GE study and the forthcoming aspirations study, which both use the model described on GiveDirectly's website. GiveDirectly is now trying to include all of its recipients in either a study or a learning objective. Learning objectives are internal tests conducted by GiveDirectly in which the standard campaign model is slightly varies. GiveDirectly uses results from learning objective campaigns to gather information about how it might adjust its operating procedures (e.g., experimentation with proxy means tests). #### Research studies under rolling-campaign model\n\nThe rolling model is preferable in most ways to the discrete-campaign model. It allows GiveDirectly to employ people for longer than a few months at a time, and to operate more as an organization rather than a standalone project. Though it is not necessarily more difficult to incorporate a study into the rolling model, it does introduce some complexities. The rolling model places some pressure on academics to organize their studies in a way that fits into GiveDirectly's timeline. The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers. The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not\n\n=== Page 9 ===\n\nwant to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual. ### Operational updates\n\n#### Segovia platform\n\nGiveDirectly expects some efficiency gains from adopting Segovia, but no more than what could be expected from any upgrade in technology, such as an upgrade in finance software. GiveDirectly's chairman, Michael Faye, is the lead on Segovia, while Dr. Niehaus leads on GiveDirectly's work, and each provides occasional support to the other. Combined, the two of them dedicate the equivalent of two CEOs' hours to Segovia and GiveDirectly. #### US staffing\n\nTo help fill the general management position in its New York office, GiveDirectly has engaged a recruiter, which has supplied several candidates. Some of these are in late-stage conversations with GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has seen high interest in its open partnerships lead position, but identifying candidates with the right level of talent has been challenging. Recruiting for this role has been conducted mainly through networking. The candidates GiveDirectly has seen so far would likely take on more of a supporting role, assisting with analysis and strategy. GiveDirectly is also interested in a candidate who could explore more traditionally fundraising-oriented partnerships, such as corporate partnerships that could raise GiveDirectly's retail profile, as well as speak with family foundations and conduct more one-on-one discussions. Finding candidates for its open digital marketing and products position has also been a challenge, as quality talent in this field is in high demand. GiveDirectly's current management do not have many marketed-related contacts, but have started investigating personal networks more deeply. GiveDirectly has also enlisted another recruiter to help expand the pipeline of candidates. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households.\n\n#### Mobile money partnership\n\nGiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN.

This trial indicated that unconditional cash grants lead to large increases in recipients\' consumption, assets, business investment, and revenue, but did not observe a short-term increase in profits. Studies of cash transfer programs that differ in meaningful ways from GiveDirectly\'s have suggested that transfers may be invested at high rates of return over the long term. Cost-effectiveness: Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, and cash transfers are in the same range of cost-effectiveness of other priority programs we have considered.

Our process\n\n2012\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n#### Program description\n\nThere are three types of cash transfer programs that have been studied:\n\n* Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), in which recipients receive cash only if they fulfill various requirements such as rates of school attendance or visits to health centers. There is a subset of CCTs in which the conditions are announced but are not formally monitored, so all participants receive a transfer regardless of compliance with the announced conditions.1\n* Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), in which selected participants receive funds without a requirement to meet additional conditions. * Business grant programs, in which unconditional in-kind or cash grants are given to micro-enterprises that have no paid employees other than the owners. The program conducted by GiveDirectly is different from most of the cash transfer programs that have previously been studied because it aims to transfer _wealth_ rather\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nthan _income_, and not exclusively to business-owners. In practice, this means that participants receive large sums of money (~100% of per-capita annual consumption) over a relatively short period of time (~8 months), with no formal or informal restrictions on how the funds are used. We review the results of all three different types of cash transfer programs that have been studied, including a **randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program**, in order to address the likely effects of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers. In the case of conditional cash transfers, we focus on impacts that do not seem relevant to the conditionality itself, e.g., impacts on consumption rather than on school attendance or other behaviors that are conditions of receiving the transfers. ## Program Track Record\n\nBelow is a list of the cash transfer programs evaluated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that we reviewed for our initial report in 2012.2 This list includes basic information about the program and key findings from the RCT that studied the program. We discuss many of the studies in more detail on **our old cash transfer review page**.

GiveDirectly\'s program is substantially different from nearly all cash transfer programs that have previously been studied. Accordingly, it is not clear that evidence from most academic studies (of very differently-structured cash transfer programs) will provide accurate estimates of the effect of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers on their recipients; GiveDirectly\'s transfers might be either far more or far less effective than more conventionally-structured cash transfers: receiving large lump sums might lead people to spend more frivolously; or lump sums might be invested at higher rates than ongoing transfers would be, leading to higher long-term consumption. For this reason, in assessing GiveDirectly\'s impact, we put the most weight on the results of an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, discussed below. Despite the questions about the applicability of the evidence from other cash transfer programs to GiveDirectly\'s programs, we review this evidence below. === Page 8 ===\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on cash transfers but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nAs discussed at our old in-depth review of cash transfer impacts, most of the studies we have reviewed on cash transfers show meaningful impacts on food consumption (~20% increase over baseline/control group spending on food). In addition, the World Bank\'s review states, "There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, within the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels"46 - such as milk, meat, fruits, vegetables, and eggs.47\n\nAcross the four randomized controlled trials where it is measured in comparable terms, increases in spending on food makes up more than half of the transfer amount:\n\nIn a randomized study of the Mexican Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program, approximately three quarters of transfers are estimated to be spent on food.48\n\nA second study from Mexico, of the Programa Apoyo Alimentario, an unmonitored conditional cash transfer, found that nearly all (94%) of cash transfers were spent on food.49\n\nA randomized study of the RPS conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua estimated that roughly three quarters of the transfer was spent on food.50\n\nIn a randomized controlled trial of the CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program in Kenya, roughly half of transfers are spent on food.51\n\n=== Page 9 ===\n\n## Alcohol and tobacco\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on this topic but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, which did not find an increase in spending on alcohol or tobacco. For more on recipients\' spending on alcohol and tobacco in this study, see below._\n\nCash transfers could be used for alcohol or tobacco, which may have adverse effects. Three randomized controlled trials of cash transfers that report spending on alcohol or tobacco do not find large increases due to cash transfers:\n\nA randomized study of the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario food security program in Mexico, which had formal conditions that were not enforced, found that cash transfers caused an increase in alcohol consumption equivalent to 1.5% of the value of the transfer, and no increase in tobacco consumption.52 The authors add, "Only 5% of households report consuming alcohol in any amount. This is most likely an underestimate as the survey was usually answered by the female head of the households who might not be aware of all alcohol purchases by other family members. Importantly, given the large increase in consumption of non-alcohol goods under both transfer types, there is little leeway for household members to purchase non-recorded alcohol. "53\n\nIn a randomized study of the Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer program Red de Proteccion Social, alcohol and tobacco made up 0.5% of food expenditures, and the effect of cash transfers was small (0.1% of food expenditures) and statistically insignificant.54 However, this study also states, "Information about alcohol and tobacco expenditures in these types of surveys is often unreliable; it is presented separately and we draw no conclusions from the reported information. "55\n\n=== Page 10 ===\n\nA randomized evaluation of Kenya\'s CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program found a small and statistically insignificant decrease in alcohol consumption.56\n\nIn all three studies, these results come from surveys of how people spend money in general, rather than specifically asking about the spending of cash transfer funds, and then comparing reported spending on alcohol and tobacco across the treatment and control groups. Different forms of misreporting of spending would have different effects on the validity of the estimates, but we would guess that the misreporting would lead the estimated effects to be biased downward (i.e. to underestimate the effect of transfers on alcohol consumption).57\n\nA study by the World Bank, which we haven\'t looked at closely, reviewed "19 studies with quantitative evidence on the impact of cash transfers on temptation goods [primarily alcohol and tobacco], as well as 11 studies that surveyed the number of respondents who reported they used transfers for temptation goods" and concluded that "Almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of transfers on temptation goods [and in] the only (two, non-experimental) studies with positive significant impacts, the magnitude is small. "58\n\nTaking into account the three studies, the review and the potential for bias, we would guess that any increases in consumption of alcohol or tobacco due to cash transfers would be small. ### Investment\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012.

Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients? What versions of the intervention are best? Our process\n\n2012\n\n#### Program description\n\nThere are three types of cash transfer programs that have been studied:\n\n* Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), in which recipients receive cash only if they fulfill various requirements such as rates of school attendance or visits to health centers. There is a subset of CCTs in which the conditions are announced but are not formally monitored, so all participants receive a transfer regardless of compliance with the announced conditions.1\n* Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), in which selected participants receive funds without a requirement to meet additional conditions.\n* Business grant programs, in which unconditional in-kind or cash grants are given to micro-enterprises that have no paid employees other than the owners. The program conducted by GiveDirectly is different from most of the cash transfer programs that have previously been studied because it aims to transfer _wealth_ rather than _income_, and not exclusively to business-owners. In practice, this means that participants receive large sums of money (~100% of per-capita annual consumption) over a relatively short period of time (~8 months), with no formal or informal restrictions on how the funds are used. We review the results of all three different types of cash transfer programs that have been studied, including a **randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program**, in order to address the likely effects of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers. In the case of conditional cash transfers, we focus on impacts that do not seem relevant to the conditionality itself, e.g., impacts on consumption rather than on school attendance or other behaviors that are conditions of receiving the transfers.\n\n## Program Track Record\n\nBelow is a list of the cash transfer programs evaluated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that we reviewed for our initial report in 2012.2 This list includes basic information about the program and key findings from the RCT that studied the program. We discuss many of the studies in more detail on **our old cash transfer review page**. For a list of the studies we identified in our 2013 update of this report, see this footnote.3\n\n9/10/2020\nRed De\nCCT\nHealth: workshops, Proteccion regular health care visits, up-to-date vaccinations, (2000-). adequate weight gain;\nEducation: enrollment, 85% attendance, grade promotion.13\nAtencion a\nCCT\nEducation: enrollment, Crisis (2005), 85% attendance; occupational training course; business grant plan.17\nplan.17\n18% of PCE;18 -30% higher food bimonthly19 consumption; more use of health services; improved self-reported health but unimproved on anthropometric measures (more)\nBono de\nCCT but No monitoring.

Accordingly, it is not clear that evidence from most academic studies (of very differently-structured cash transfer programs) will provide accurate estimates of the effect of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers on their recipients; GiveDirectly\'s transfers might be either far more or far less effective than more conventionally-structured cash transfers: receiving large lump sums might lead people to spend more frivolously; or lump sums might be invested at higher rates than ongoing transfers would be, leading to higher long-term consumption. For this reason, in assessing GiveDirectly\'s impact, we put the most weight on the results of an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, discussed below. Despite the questions about the applicability of the evidence from other cash transfer programs to GiveDirectly\'s programs, we review this evidence below.\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on cash transfers but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nAs discussed at our old in-depth review of cash transfer impacts, most of the studies we have reviewed on cash transfers show meaningful impacts on food consumption (~20% increase over baseline/control group spending on food). In addition, the World Bank\'s review states, "There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, within the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels"46 - such as milk, meat, fruits, vegetables, and eggs.47\n\nAcross the four randomized controlled trials where it is measured in comparable terms, increases in spending on food makes up more than half of the transfer amount:\n\nIn a randomized study of the Mexican Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program, approximately three quarters of transfers are estimated to be spent on food.48\n\nA second study from Mexico, of the Programa Apoyo Alimentario, an unmonitored conditional cash transfer, found that nearly all (94%) of cash transfers were spent on food.49\n\nA randomized study of the RPS conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua estimated that roughly three quarters of the transfer was spent on food.50\n\nIn a randomized controlled trial of the CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program in Kenya, roughly half of transfers are spent on food.51\n\n## Alcohol and tobacco\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on this topic but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, which did not find an increase in spending on alcohol or tobacco. For more on recipients\' spending on alcohol and tobacco in this study, see below._\n\nCash transfers could be used for alcohol or tobacco, which may have adverse effects. Three randomized controlled trials of cash transfers that report spending on alcohol or tobacco do not find large increases due to cash transfers:\n\nA randomized study of the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario food security program in Mexico, which had formal conditions that were not enforced, found that cash transfers caused an increase in alcohol consumption equivalent to 1.5% of the value of the transfer, and no increase in tobacco consumption.52 The authors add, "Only 5% of households report consuming alcohol in any amount. This is most likely an underestimate as the survey was usually answered by the female head of the households who might not be aware of all alcohol purchases by other family members. Importantly, given the large increase in consumption of non-alcohol goods under both transfer types, there is little leeway for household members to purchase non-recorded alcohol."53\n\nIn a randomized study of the Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer program Red de Proteccion Social, alcohol and tobacco made up 0.5% of food expenditures, and the effect of cash transfers was small (0.1% of food expenditures) and statistically insignificant.54 However, this study also states, "Information about alcohol and tobacco expenditures in these types of surveys is often unreliable; it is presented separately and we draw no conclusions from the reported information."55\n\nA randomized evaluation of Kenya\'s CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program found a small and statistically insignificant decrease in alcohol consumption.56\n\nIn all three studies, these results come from surveys of how people spend money in general, rather than specifically asking about the spending of cash transfer funds, and then comparing reported spending on alcohol and tobacco across the treatment and control groups. Different forms of misreporting of spending would have different effects on the validity of the estimates, but we would guess that the misreporting would lead the estimated effects to be biased downward (i.e. to underestimate the effect of transfers on alcohol consumption).57\n\nA study by the World Bank, which we haven\'t looked at closely, reviewed "19 studies with quantitative evidence on the impact of cash transfers on temptation goods [primarily alcohol and tobacco], as well as 11 studies that surveyed the number of respondents who reported they used transfers for temptation goods" and concluded that "Almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of transfers on temptation goods [and in] the only (two, non-experimental) studies with positive significant impacts, the magnitude is small."58\n\nTaking into account the three studies, the review and the potential for bias, we would guess that any increases in consumption of alcohol or tobacco due to cash transfers would be small.\n\n### Investment\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012.

Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.148 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.149 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.150 GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.151 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.152 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.153 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.154 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Lack of statistical powerThe study included 471 households cross-randomized among three treatment arms, which led to eight possible treatment groups.155 Some treatment arms therefore have fairly small sample sizes (for example, only 128 households received large transfers) and estimates of relative effects of treatment arms are imprecise. Self-reporting biasOutcome data in this study are self-reported, which could lead to positive bias if treatment households sought to please researchers with their use of the transfers. We are especially concerned that treatment households might under-report their use of alcohol and tobacco. === Page 25 ===\n\n#### Positive bias due to negative spillovers. The study estimates treatment effects by comparing treatment households in treatment villages to control households in treatment villages.156 If transfers had negative spillover effects on control households in treatment villages, estimates of their effects on recipients would be overestimated. The researchers address this issue explicitly in their paper.157\n\n### Our interpretation of the results\n\nWe place high weight on Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 because we believe it is a well-executed, pre-registered RCT and because it directly measures variations on GiveDirectly\'s program. We believe that the RCT supports the notion that, in the short-run, participating in GiveDirectly is likely to increase recipients\' assets and consumption.158\n\nBecause of the study\'s short-term nature, we cannot confidently determine whether recipients\' increased spending on livestock, agriculture, non-agricultural businesses, and (possibly) education have positive returns but, as of the time of the end-line survey, recipients\' additional business spending had not yielded additional profits.159\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 supports the notion that GiveDirectly has meaningful impacts on asset holdings and consumption for recipients. However, it also provides initial evidence that GiveDirectly recipients are unlikely to invest their transfers in business activities at high returns, as seen in RCTs of programs that provide business training in addition to cash transfers and/or require recipients to propose business plans. === Page 26 ===\n\n# Evidence from two studies of unrestricted wealth transfers\n\nHere we provide more detail on two studies which provided unrestricted cash grants to recipients in Uganda, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) (evaluated by Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013) and the Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program (evaluated by Blattman et al 2013). We discuss these programs in detail because they are the best evidence, other than the RCT of GiveDirectly\'s program, of the effects of unrestricted wealth transfers to individuals. However, both program differ from GiveDirectly\'s in key ways including their features that encourage recipients to invest their transfers. ## The Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda\n\n### How the program worked\n\nIn YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.160 In general, participants were "young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed. "161 Groups submitted written proposals and could request up to $1,000 for non-agricultural skills training and start up costs.162 Cash was transferred to bank accounts in the name of treatment groups\' management committees and no restrictions were placed on the money\'s use.163 The size of the grants varied widely; the average grant was $382 per capita and 80% of grants were between $200 and $600 per capita.164\n\n### How did YOP recipients spend the transfers? Most groups chose one trade and chose to have all members enter that trade.165 Strong evidence suggests that participants invested a large majority of their funds. At the median, treatment group members estimated that their group and fellow members spent 11% on skills training, 52% on tools, 13% on materials, and 24% shared\n\n=== Page 27 ===\n\nin cash or spent on other things.166 When asked about their own investments two years after the distribution, treatment group members reported 340 more hours of vocational training than controls, most of which was in tailoring, carpentry, metalwork, or hairstyling.167 On average, treatment group members also reported $219 more in business assets than controls two years after the disbursement, although this difference was reduced to $130 after four years.168\n\n### What were the overall effects of YOP? **Labor supply. ** Program participants worked 4.1 more hours per week than controls in 2010 and 5.5 more hours per week in 2012.169 In general, participants increased the hours that they spent working in skilled trades to supplement their agricultural income but continued to spend the same amount of time working in agriculture as controls.170\n\n**Return on investment. ** There is fairly strong evidence that YOP participants received large returns on their investments, leading to higher income than controls in the long-run. Members of treatment groups earned $8.50 more per month than controls in 2010 and $10.50 more per month in 2012.171 Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 estimate that the increased earnings in 2010 and 2013 represent average annual returns on the original grant of 30% and 39% respectively.172 There is no evidence that treatment group members earned more per hour than control group members, so the return probably comes from increased opportunities to do profitable work.173\n\n**Other impacts. ** Participation in YOP also lead to increased durable assets, non-durable consumption, and subjective well-being.174 There was no evidence that YOP affected non-economic factors such as kin integration, community participation, community and public good contributions, anti-social behavior, and protest attitudes and participation.175\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from YOP to GiveDirectly\'s program. === Page 28 ===\n\n#### Group structure. The group structure of YOP may have acted as a commitment device, leading recipients to invest a greater portion of their grants than recipients of unconditional transfers directly to individuals, like GiveDirectly.176\n\n##### Application process. Groups had to apply for grants with a proposal for investing in skilled trades.177 Motivated, patient, or talented individuals may have been more likely to apply and less likely to be screened out, which could have increased the propensity to invest or returns on investment.178 The application process could also have led to more investment through a mental accounting mechanism, by framing the grant in terms of business.179\n\n##### Size of grant. YOP grants were, on average, $382 per group member.180 Like GiveDirectly, YOP\'s grants are one-time unconditional wealth transfers. However, YOP\'s grants are less than 40% of the size of GiveDirectly\'s. We do not have a strong intuition about whether this would lead GiveDirectly recipients to invest a larger or smaller portion of their transfers. However, GiveDirectly participants may have lower ROIs if recipients experience diminishing returns on investment. ##### Long-run effects and divestment. Treatment members\' increased earnings can only be interpreted as return on investment if they are expected to be maintained in the long-run. There is evidence that some recipients divested from their grant over time, which could mean that earning gains were not permanent.181\n\n##### Demographic limitations. Program participants were mostly young adults.182 The effects on business assets and earnings largely disappear if the data is reweighted to reflect the demographic distribution of the entire population.183\n\n##### The Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program in Northern Uganda\n\n##### How the program worked\n\nVillages in WINGS were randomly assigned to one of two phases.184 Participants assigned to phase one entered WINGS in mid-2009 and received five days of business\n\n=== Page 29 ===\n\nskills training, a $150 startup grant (once they had a business plan approved), and follow up visits and advice from AVSI staff.185 Half of phase 1 participants were also randomly assigned to receive business networking training.186 An end-line survey in November 2010 allowed Blattman et al 2013 to estimate the medium-term effects of the full WINGS program by comparing phase 1 villages to phase 2 villages (who had not yet entered the program).187\n\nPhase 2 villages (which served as controls during phase 1) entered WINGS in early 2011.188 To disentangle the effects of the cash grants from the effects of follow-up, researchers randomly assigned one-third of these villages to receive no follow-up.189\n\nIn all, 1,800 of the most vulnerable 14-30 year olds in 120 villages in two districts were selected by AVSI and community leaders to participate in WINGS\' two phases.190\n\n"[T]he typical WINGS candidate was a young woman between the ages of 20 and 35, with little or no formal education, low income and limited access to credit. "191\n\n### How did WINGS recipients spend the transfers? Over half of all participants proposed selling mixed items in their AVSI-approved business plans.192 The vast majority of other business involved the selling of livestock, fish, and farm products.193\n\nWhen participants themselves estimated the proportion of the grant they spent on different categories, those recipients who did not receive follow up from AVSI staff reported that 27% of the grant was spent on business, 15% was spent on long-term consumption, 2% was spent on short-term consumption, and 54% was saved.194 However, when recipients were asked to estimate the cash amount that they spent on their businesses, they reported an average of just $14.50 of business expenditures, suggesting that they spent less than 10% of the grant on business expenditures.195\n\n### What were the overall effects of WINGS 18 months after the grants were distributed? Phase 1 and phase 2 villages were surveyed eighteen months after phase 1 villages entered WINGS (and before phase 2 villages entered). === Page 30 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\n**Labor supply. ** Participating in WINGS caused a 61% increase in employment hours, which consisted of a 41% increase in hours spent on subsistence work and a 79% increase in hours spent on market activities.196\n\n**Earnings and return on investment.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            We do not know whether the additional consumption enabled by the transfers will persist over the long-term and whether households\' investment in business expenditures might lead to long-term profits.145 The long-term effects of cash transfers are a key question that affects our estimate of the intervention\'s cost effectiveness. **Dynamics of transfers. ** The dynamics of the program\'s effects are particularly difficult to interpret because some households were still receiving payments at the time of the survey while others received their final transfers more than a year prior to the endline survey.146 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 may have underestimated effects on investment spending and farm revenue by asking backwards looking questions about treatment households\' spending in time periods before some households received their transfers.147\n\nData on roofs. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.148 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.149 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.150 GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.151 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.152 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.153 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.154 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources.\n\nLack of statistical power. The study included 471 households cross-randomized among three treatment arms, which led to eight possible treatment groups.155 Some treatment arms therefore have fairly small sample sizes (for example, only 128 households received large transfers) and estimates of relative effects of treatment arms are imprecise. Self-reporting bias. Outcome data in this study are self-reported, which could lead to positive bias if treatment households sought to please researchers with their use of the transfers. We are especially concerned that treatment households might under-report their use of alcohol and tobacco.\n\n#### Positive bias due to negative spillovers. The study estimates treatment effects by comparing treatment households in treatment villages to control households in treatment villages.156 If transfers had negative spillover effects on control households in treatment villages, estimates of their effects on recipients would be overestimated. The researchers address this issue explicitly in their paper.157\n\n### Our interpretation of the results\n\nWe place high weight on Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 because we believe it is a well-executed, pre-registered RCT and because it directly measures variations on GiveDirectly\'s program. We believe that the RCT supports the notion that, in the short-run, participating in GiveDirectly is likely to increase recipients\' assets and consumption.158\n\nBecause of the study\'s short-term nature, we cannot confidently determine whether recipients\' increased spending on livestock, agriculture, non-agricultural businesses, and (possibly) education have positive returns but, as of the time of the end-line survey, recipients\' additional business spending had not yielded additional profits.159\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 supports the notion that GiveDirectly has meaningful impacts on asset holdings and consumption for recipients. However, it also provides initial evidence that GiveDirectly recipients are unlikely to invest their transfers in business activities at high returns, as seen in RCTs of programs that provide business training in addition to cash transfers and/or require recipients to propose business plans.\n\n# Evidence from two studies of unrestricted wealth transfers\n\nHere we provide more detail on two studies which provided unrestricted cash grants to recipients in Uganda, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) (evaluated by Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013) and the Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program (evaluated by Blattman et al 2013). We discuss these programs in detail because they are the best evidence, other than the RCT of GiveDirectly\'s program, of the effects of unrestricted wealth transfers to individuals. However, both program differ from GiveDirectly\'s in key ways including their features that encourage recipients to invest their transfers.\n\n## The Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda\n\n### How the program worked\n\nIn YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.160 In general, participants were "young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed."161 Groups submitted written proposals and could request up to $1,000 for non-agricultural skills training and start up costs.162 Cash was transferred to bank accounts in the name of treatment groups\' management committees and no restrictions were placed on the money\'s use.163 The size of the grants varied widely; the average grant was $382 per capita and 80% of grants were between $200 and $600 per capita.164\n\n### How did YOP recipients spend the transfers? \n\nMost groups chose one trade and chose to have all members enter that trade.165 Strong evidence suggests that participants invested a large majority of their funds.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?".

Topics discussed in this conversation include Mr. Skeates\' previous work experience and future work responsibilities at GiveDirectly, changes implemented in response to the case of staff fraud in Uganda, and various issues that can compromise the success of GiveDirectly\'s work. ### About Stuart Skeates\n\nStuart Skeates is GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director. Prior to his role at GiveDirectly, Mr. Skeates was at McKinsey & Company, where he worked with the government of Ethiopia on energy and water projects. ### Mr. Skeates\' work plan in 2015\n\nAround early November 2014, Mr. Skeates will transition from working full time in Uganda as the Field Director to being based out of GiveDirectly\'s Kenya office. Mr. Skeates will still spend one week per month in Mbale, Uganda, to oversee the ongoing Uganda 2M campaign. In total, he expects to spend one third of his time on work specific to Uganda. The other two thirds of his time will be spent on miscellaneous projects, including:\n\n* Conducting a cost benefit analysis of GiveDirectly\'s program to better understand the tradeoffs of cutting certain costs.\n* Assisting Joe Huston, GiveDirectly Kenya Field Director, with some of GiveDirectly\'s research projects. Mr. Skeates is planning to supervise data collection for the behavioral study.\n* Changing protocols such as conducting a cash out day with GiveDirectly filling the role of the mobile money provider, and modifying targeting criteria to a "Thatch Plus" model that includes some additional types of households.\n* Helping with the deployment of Segovia technology. ### Changes implemented in response to staff fraud\n\nIn the Uganda pilot campaign, GiveDirectly cash out days were managed by the Uganda Senior Field Officer, the Uganda Office Manager who also managed the GiveDirectly hotline, and mobile money agents. After these people fraudulently diverted funds from recipients, GiveDirectly implemented a series of changes:\n\n* Terminated the GiveDirectly staff who had been involved in the fraud; started working with new mobile money agents.\n* Removed all of its staff from the cash out day process except the Uganda Field Director. The Uganda Field Director had previously been making planned visits to oversee some of the cash out days; he now actively manages all of them along with new mobile money agents.\n* Appointed community-nominated monitors to assist the Uganda Field Director on the cash out day with translation, observe transactions between recipients and mobile money agents, and report any issues they see. GiveDirectly compensates the monitors with 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) for their time during a cash out day.\n* Developed networks of English-speaking informants who are not formally announced within the villages, but are tasked with also reporting any issues they see regarding transfers. To date, 4 of the 9 informants have provided GiveDirectly with helpful information, such as identifying that households in the enrollment process were actually ineligible, and telling GiveDirectly that someone had taken a recipient\'s phone after the recipient passed away.\n* Moved the GiveDirectly call center (hotline) to Kampala, to increase the separation of call center staff from field staff, who are based in Mbale.\n* Tasked the call center with calling a randomly selected 10% of the village during a cash out day to see if it is going smoothly.\n* Changed the contractual agreement GiveDirectly has with mobile money agents to include an indemnity clause, so that in the case of stolen funds, GiveDirectly could remove funds directly from a mobile money agent\'s account.\n\nFor more on the staff fraud, see this blog post that GiveDirectly published after our site visit: https://www.givedirectly.org/blog_post.php?id=6720123171950519215 (archived version available here: http://www.webcitation.org/6TwrteHbT). ## Issues\n\n### Security of phones and mobile money accounts\n\nSome recipients, especially elderly ones, have to learn how to use cell phones for the first time in order to manage the GiveDirectly transfers in mobile money accounts. These people have a more difficult time understanding how to keep their phones secure; for example, they often keep the phone in its original packaging and do not conceal it. Another problem with security is that some recipients will share the PIN numbers for their mobile money accounts, either intentionally or unintentionally by handing the phone to a mobile money agent before pressing "Send" (so the PIN number is still apparent on the screen of the phone.) This makes recipients more vulnerable to people who wanted to steal money from their accounts. Teaching PIN saftey has long been a priority, and GiveDirectly has added additional emphasis on the topic (e.g., emphasis during village meetings, additional trainings given by the mobile provider) Improved security is a reason why GiveDirectly is interested in piloting biometric authentication for mobile money accounts, though it does not currently have plans to do so. ### Increased gaming\n\nOne village in Kenya had a significantly higher than average level of gaming (ineligible residents falsely posing as meeting the eligibility requirements). The gaming seemed to be coordinated across the village, though GiveDirectly did not know who had orchestrated it. In this case, GiveDirectly responded by holding a community meeting to acknowledge the issue and announce that it would be pausing transfers for all recipients until the cases of gaming were resolved. GiveDirectly also asked community members to report any information they had on these cases. In the Uganda 2M campaign, there was also one village with high levels of gaming. GiveDirectly mentioned two possible contributing factors: 1) the village was close to another village that had already received transfers, so it is likely that there was a higher level of awareness of GiveDirectly\'s targeting criteria at the outset, enabling people to pose as meeting the criteria from the census stage; 2) evidence that a corrupt staff member planted a false recipient in the village. ### Theft\n\nThere are cases of theft from individual recipients. Most of the theft of transfers is happening from within villages, rather than external people coming to the villages to steal funds. ### Transfer size\n\nIn 2014, GiveDirectly decided to adjust the size of future transfers to keep up with inflation. This will come into effect during 2015. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n## Conversation with Stuart Skeates of GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014\n\n### Participants\n\n* Stuart Skeates - Uganda Field Director, GiveDirectly\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Josh Rosenberg - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n### Note: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by GiveDirectly. ### Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Stuart Skeates, GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director, while visiting GiveDirectly in Uganda.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively.

Conversation topics included GiveDirectly\'s goals for 2016, deprioritized areas of work, budget allocation, impact on charitable giving and development assistance, and operations updates. ## Goals for 2016\n\n### Doubling non-Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to approximately double the amount of non-Good Ventures funding it receives, from about $25 million in 2015 to $50-55 million this year. This is because GiveDirectly would prefer not to assume that the Good Ventures funding is ongoing from year to year. ### Advancing institutional partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to finalize its next two major partnerships this year. However, the likelihood of this will largely depend on how quickly these potential institutional partners are able to act. Currently GiveDirectly is prioritizing the largest donors in the international aid sector. If GiveDirectly is able to hire a partnerships manager in the near future, it may begin to look at the next tier of funders. Through these partnerships, GiveDirectly aims to influence the movement of official development assistance towards more cost-effective programs. It also hopes to have a similar effect on retail donations in the US, and on the actions of NGOs. ### Testing a basic income guarantee program\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to launch a test of a program that would guarantee a basic income to participants over the course of several years. The idea for a universal basic income has gained some traction around the world but has never been done in its full form and evaluated, so GiveDirectly believes this is a good time to test it. === Page 2 ===\n\nGiveDirectly has not yet finalized the amount of the basic income it would provide through this program. GiveDirectly wants the income to provide a meaningful level of support. The amount will likely be between 25 cents and just over $1 per day. The income would be transferred in regular installments over at least ten years. While a full universal basic income would not be feasible at the present time in some of the least developed countries because of budget constraints, there are other countries where it would be feasible. GiveDirectly also believes that the experiment will still be policy relevant even to budget-constrained country governments, as there are many potential variations that would be feasible (e.g., versions targeted to particular regions). GiveDirectly will study the impacts, many of which they expect to see in the first few years of the program. ### Doubling field staff capacity and hiring for future growth\n\nIn 2016, GiveDirectly would like to double the amount of money moved through its cash transfer programs. It also intends to conduct additional hiring and planning so that it can double its capacity again in 2017. GiveDirectly finds that its rate of growth is one of the most important factors affecting its ability to recruit and hire talent for more senior positions. It also believes that this growth is an important factor in driving the policy impacts it seeks to have by generating attention on GiveDirectly\'s model and on the questions that model raises for other, existing interventions. ### Testing program variations\n\nGiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:\n\n* **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches: * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out. * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others\' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once. * **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly. ** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment. === Page 3 ===\n\n### Deprioritized areas for 2016\n\n#### Generic outreach to foundations\n\nGiveDirectly has been deprioritizing foundation outreach unrelated to specific projects for approximately the last year. #### Other learning projects\n\nGiveDirectly has deprioritized several learning projects that it concluded were not as important as the basic income guarantee experiment, such as distributing cash transfers in an urban setting or providing cash transfers to sex workers. #### Partnerships with combined funding/implementing organizations\n\nGiveDirectly is often approached by organizations such as UNICEF and World Food Programme (WFP) to provide assistance with running a cash transfer program or program component. However, GiveDirectly has generally chosen not to enter into such partnerships with organizations that are not the ultimate funders of international aid. The ultimate funders of aid programs are usually national governments, which then fund the World Bank and UN organizations. #### 2016 budget allocations\n\n#### Allocation of funds across countries\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable. #### Marketing budget\n\nFor both retail marketing and partnership projects, GiveDirectly plans to spend approximately $3-4 million, depending on when various personnel are hired. #### Good Ventures funding\n\nIf progress on partnership discussions is not satisfactory, GiveDirectly may dedicate some Good Ventures funding to other projects, such as the basic income guarantee program or some of the previously deprioritized learning projects described above. A third option would be further investment in building capacity in Rwanda. #### Room for more funding\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nCurrently GiveDirectly has the capacity needed to move the amount of funding it has secured and what it estimates it will receive in the future. If GiveDirectly had substantially greater funding, it would have to decide whether to hire more staff to expand its capacity, or redirect some of its existing staff\'s time away from more complex projects and operations and onto a simpler method of distributing cash transfers. Additional funding would likely be allocated to standard cash transfers in Kenya, Uganda, or Rwanda. The basic income guarantee program will allow for a higher volume of cash distributed by each field director, since by its nature it commits a larger amount of money to each participant than the standard cash transfer programs. ### GiveDirectly\'s broader impact on the aid sector\n\nGiveDirectly conducts three activities that it believes may broadly affect aid policy:\n\n* Routine cash transfers funded by retail donors\n* Experimental cash transfers evaluated by outside researchers\n* Cash transfers delivered through a strategic partnership with an institutional funder. Dr. Niehaus believes that strategic partnerships may be the most influential of these three activities, but its impact is also the hardest to measure. ### Indirect impact on institutional policy through diffuse channels\n\nThere is currently an ongoing debate within the UN over how cash transfers might be incorporated into humanitarian aid, as the present system is largely built around in-kind assistance such as food, clothing, and shelter. Cash does not have an obvious place in the existing system. However, Dr. Niehaus believes that significant impact may come first through indirect influence of high-level officials. For example, in a recently released report, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that cash transfers should be the default form of aid to refugees where possible. This could have hypothetically resulted from conversations with his staffers who were aware of GiveDirectly. The statement could then influence other UN agencies to incorporate cash transfers into their activities. However, it is difficult to conclusively attribute any of these events to GiveDirectly\'s work. Mr. Bassin believes that public support from a highly placed official (such as the UN secretary-general) for a nontraditional form of aid like cash transfers can carry significant weight with institutional funders and staff decision makers, who tend to be very risk-averse. Second, Dr. Niehaus believes that the work of GiveDirectly, its findings, and its popularity with donors and the press can provide a tool for staff within bi-lateral and multi-lateral institutions to begin conversations about the efficacy of cash and how favorably it compares to other existing interventions. ### Impact on other implementing organizations\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nAssessing to what extent GiveDirectly\'s work has influenced other implementing organizations is also a challenge. GiveDirectly can provide examples that hint at its impact; for example, one group has written a grant proposal that includes several alternative models of aid, one of which is explicitly called "the GiveDirectly model." However, systematic measurement of how widespread this impact is would be very difficult. ### Overall strategy for influencing policy\n\nGiveDirectly believes influencing institutional funders is a complex process. It believes that its best strategic approach is to set up on-the-ground projects incorporating cash transfers, whenever possible with institutional funders as a partner, rather than to attend conferences or produce papers on the subject. Starting these projects requires operational capacity, the ability to find a strong and credible team of researchers, and some creativity in figuring out how to bring a project into accord with the regulations of the institutional partner. GiveDirectly has also found it especially helpful to be able to bring private dollars to the table to leverage matching dollars from institutional funders in order to catalyze their participation. GiveDirectly is among the few organizations with the skills and willingness to take on this kind of work, with the aim of setting up projects that will foster debate within the international aid community. ### Operational update on Homa Bay County\n\n#### Increase in refusal rate\n\nGiveDirectly has seen an uptick in the rate of refusal to participate in its cash transfer program in Homa Bay. The root of this development is not clear, and GiveDirectly has not yet identified a solution. In some cases, community members are led by local religious leaders or local government to mistrust the program. In Siaya County, this issue did not arise, possibly because GiveDirectly covered such a large portion of the county that in any new area it entered, people were already aware of the program and knew that it was trustworthy. GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program\'s purpose. In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion. For this reason, it has not attempted to re-enroll those who refused, but might do so in the future. #### Targeting in Homa Bay\n\nAll enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **A conversation with Paul Niehaus, Carolina Toth, and Ian Bassin, February 23, 2016**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Ian Bassin - Chief Operating Officer (Domestic), GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Finance and Operations Manager, GiveDirectly\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by GiveDirectly.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus, Ms. Toth, and Mr. Bassin of GiveDirectly for a general update.

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Page Label Removal\n\n**Input:**\n=== Page 1 ===\n\nWe\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively.

In addition to conversations with GiveDirectly staff, GiveWell went to 2 villages to meet with recipients and observed a cash out day. ## Meeting with recipients\n\nOn October 20, 2014, we (GiveWell staff) travelled with GiveDirectly to Kavo and Apungure, adjacent villages located about one hour\'s drive outside of Mbale, a small city in southeastern Uganda. Both villages had been part of GiveDirectly\'s first campaign in Uganda (the "Uganda pilot"). At the time of our visit, all transfers had been made to households in that campaign, and final follow up surveys were ongoing. GiveDirectly had randomly selected a short list of households that we could visit, and then called each of them ahead of time to make an appointment. We ended up visiting 2 households in Kavo and 2 households in Apungure. We were accompanied on these visits by GiveDirectly staff, one of which translated our conversations with recipients. The below notes summarize what recipients told us in those conversations. **Household #1 (Paul)**\n\n* There are 11 people in Paul\'s family who all live on the same compound. * Paul is not married, he lives alone, and he is the only beneficiary in his family. * Paul farms, as does the rest of his family; Paul does not have any other jobs. * Paul received 2.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$960) from GiveDirectly. (50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) had been deducted because Paul opted to buy a cell phone through GiveDirectly, and the other 50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) was taken in the case of GD staff fraud.) * Paul used 1 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$450) to cover 2 years of school fees (Senior 1 and Senior 2 levels.) Paul thinks he could pass the exams necessary to finish school, but has not sat for them (there are fees associated with secondary school exams).Paul said that if he were able to complete Senior 4, he could then go to school to become a mechanic, but he does not currently have enough funds to\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\ncomplete Senior 4. Paul said that in the long run, he will be better off because of his spending on education. * Paul used 450,000 UGX (~$180) to purchase 18 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX per sheet. He stores these iron sheets inside his father\'s house, which is larger and has an iron roof. Paul said that he does not have enough sheets for a full roof yet. * Paul said that he is trying to make bricks out of mud so that he can build a new house and put a roof on it by February 2015. * Paul said that he wants to replace his thatch roof because finding the special kind of grass needed for the roofs is difficult, and because sometimes termites attack him. * Paul used some of the funds for domestic expenses. * Paul has 300,000 UGX (~$120) left from the transfer; he is keeping this money (in cash) in case of an emergency. * Paul said that he chose to spend the money in these ways because his father has some land, which Paul expects to inherit some day. * When we asked about the money that had been deducted from his transfer, Paul said that he had been told 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the phone and 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the SIM card, and that no one called the hotline to report this extremely high price for a SIM card because the person running the hotline was one of the staff who told recipients about the SIM card deduction. * When we asked if Paul thinks it would be better to give a smaller sized transfer to more people (rather than keeping transfer size at $1000), he said that since he\'s in need of more money, he wouldn\'t want to reduce the size of the transfer. * When we asked if there is anything that GD could do differently, Paul said increase the transfer size. * We also asked if Paul had seen any good or bad spending, and he said that some people spent money on alcohol. * Paul asked GiveDirectly staff if the deduction from his transfer was "genuine" and whether it would be replaced. GiveDirectly staff explained that the deduction for the phone was genuine, and the second one for the SIM card was not. ### Household #2 (Gilbert)\n\n* There are 5 people in Gilbert\'s household: Gilbert, his wife, and 3 children. * Gilbert said that he received 2.39 million UGX (~$960) from GiveDirectly. * The first thing that Gilbert spent transfer funds on was domestic items that he lacked, including a mattress, plates, saucepans, and cups. * Gilbert used some of the transfer funds to build a brick and cement house with iron roof: * Iron sheets were purchased from Katongole; 14 sheets at a price of 26,000 UGX per sheet * Other building materials were purchased within his village * Labor costs: 400,000 UGX (~$160) for masons, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for mixers, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for water for laborers * House took 3 months to build\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\n* Gilbert said that the problems with having a match roof are that heavy rains can blow the roof off, and moderate rains will cause the roof to leak. * Gilbert spent some of the transfer funds on medical treatments for malaria and other illnesses. * Gilbert spent some of the transfer funds on supplies for agriculture (he specifically mentioned seeds and leasing land for one year.) Gilbert said that he farms mainly for consumption, but could sell some of the produce in case of financial hardship. Gilbert farms maize, cassava, sweet potato and soya beans. * Gilbert said that he does not have enough land, so cannot raise animals. * Gilbert does not have any funds remaining from the transfer. * Gilbert said that he withdrew cash at the cash out days GiveDirectly coordinated at a nearby church, and that he stored materials because he could not store cash. * When we asked whether Gilbert thought it was better for households in one village to receive $1000 each or households in 2 villages to receive $500, he said that the amount of the transfer ($1000) should stay the same. * Gilbert said that no other charities work in his village. **Household #3 (Scovia)**\n\n* 5 people in Scovia\'s household: Scovia, her husband, their child, her husband\'s other wife (Scovia\'s "co-wife"), child of husband and co-wife. * Scovia was the official recipient. When we met with her near her household, her husband joined. Scovia\'s husband answered nearly all of the questions that we asked. * Scovia\'s husband told us that his father had incurred a debt of 20 cows, which he asked his sons for help in paying off. The debt was: 10 cows for the dowry from the father\'s marriage 10 cows for traditional healing the father had sought as treatment for a problem with spirits\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he spent 1.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$560) to purchase 2 bulls and 2 cows to help his father pay off this debt. * Paying off the debt from the traditional healing enabled Scovia\'s husband to reclaim some land. * Scovia\'s husband also spent 425,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$170) on 17 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10) per sheet. Scovia\'s husband said that he wanted to use the money to construct a new house but could not do so with the debt outstanding. He said that match roofs leak and the wind can blow them away. * Separate from the transfer, Scovia\'s husband had saved 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260) over about 1 year to buy a motorcycle, and he said he used the rest of the transfer (about 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260)) to top up these funds and make the purchase. Scovia\'s husband said he has been working as a motorcycle taxi driver. On a bad day, his revenue is 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4), on a good day, his revenue is 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10), and he spends about 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) per day on food and gas when he is working. === Page 4 ===\n\n* Scovia\'s husband also said that he/his household [we didn\'t clarify] earn money by planting rice. In a good season, they will harvest 10 bags of 100kg each of rice, which brings in 2.5 million UGX ($1000). * Scovia\'s husband said that before receiving the transfer from GiveDirectly, getting a meal was a problem, and he didn\'t have seeds or land. Since receiving the transfer, he bought animals and got married. * Scovia said that she and her husband had agreed as to how to spend the money. * Scovia\'s husband said that he thinks his elder wife should be eligible for a transfer, though she did not receive one. He also asked about the transfer deductions from the staff fraud. #### Household #4 (Betty)\n\n* Betty lives in a match-roof house with her very young child, on a compound owned by her relatives. * Betty said that she has lived on her own for 3 years. * Betty farms, mostly for consumption, but will sell crops if she needs money for an emergency or to buy basics like soap, sugar, and medical treatments. * Betty used 2 million UGX (~$800) to buy a piece of land from her great uncle, which she paid for in installments as she received the transfer. Betty said that the time will come when she needs to be independent of her family and will build a house on the land. Currently she has used the land to plant cassava. * Other purchases: 60,000 UGX (~$24) on a mattress, 80,000 UGX (~$32) on bedding, 180,000 UGX (~$72) on pigs. Betty said that she bought the pigs young and plans to sell them once they reach adulthood. * There were multiple people sitting nearby as we spoke to Betty, she said that they are happy for her even though they didn\'t benefit, and that they think GiveDirectly might come back and give them transfers. * When we asked Betty if she thinks GiveDirectly should continue to give $1000 to people in one village or a smaller amount to people in more villages, she said that GiveDirectly should increase the amount of the transfer. ### Observing a cash out day\n\n#### Why GiveDirectly conducts cash out days\n\nIn Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent. #### Our observations of a cash out day\n\nWe observed a cash out day in Uganda that took place in October 2014 as part of the Uganda 2M campaign. The below information is based on our observations of that cash out day and conversations about it with GiveDirectly staff. === Page 5 ===\n\nPrior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals. Upon arriving at the designated site for the cash out day (near a secondary school), many village members were already gathered.\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?".

We attempted to combine the results from these studies and create a model of the magnitude of possible spillover effects. However, we did not feel comfortable relying on this model because we lack basic information on a number of key parameters, such as how many non-recipient households may be affected by spillover effects for each treated household and how the magnitude of spillover effects changes with distance. We would revisit this explicit model if further academic analysis is able to shed light on these parameters. In the meantime, our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. We believe potential negative spillover effects of GiveDirectly\'s program are likely to be minimal on net for a number of reasons, including: the largest and highest quality study (the GE study) found no evidence of negative spillovers, and we have not seen strong evidence on the mechanisms for large negative spillover effects. However, given that negative spillover effects via inflation are theoretically plausible, and given that three studies find evidence of negative spillovers, we do include a small negative discount in our cost-effectiveness analysis for this concern. We emphasize that our conclusion at this point is very tentative, and we hope to update our views next year if there is more public discussion or research on the areas of uncertainty highlighted in our analysis. For more, see our full report on this question.\n\n## What versions of the intervention are best?\n\nWe have reviewed one RCT comparing physical cash transfers with electronic transfers to a recipient\'s cell phone.224 The study found that transferring money to cell phones was cheaper than transferring physical cash to individuals, though the initial cost of the cell phones made the cell phone transfer more expensive than handing out cash. Had the study continued longer, the cheaper ongoing costs of the cell phone transfer mechanism would have made up for the higher initial costs.225 The study also finds that recipients of the cell phone transfer recipients had to walk less than 25% as far, on average, as those who received physical cash in order to "cash out" their transfers (0.9 vs. 4.04 km).226 The cell phone transfers also appear to have increased the diversity of crops grown and consumed by people who received them, relative to the "placebo" group that just received physical transfers and a cell phone.227\n\nThe study did not find any adverse effects of using cell phone transfers relative to handing out physical cash.\n\n## 2012\n\nInitially, we conducted searches on JSTOR and Google Scholar for terms related to cash transfers, especially seeking out systematic reviews, and tracing citations in order to find randomized trials. We relied particularly heavily on two major literature reviews in our research on CCTs: a World Bank review228 and a Cochrane review.229 Of the literature reviews that we found, we relied on these two because they included a high percentage of RCTs and they presented the data from the studies clearly. We also searched the World Bank DIME database for relevant studies, discussed with GiveDirectly staff, and added studies as they arose in the process of drafting and updating this report.\n\n## 2013\n\nMany new studies on cash transfers have been published since December 2012. For this update we have not attempted to thoroughly read all new research published on cash transfers over the course of the last year. We focused on a recently released RCT of a variation on GiveDirectly\'s program in Kenya.230\n\nWe also looked for RCTs with evidence on programs that were unconditional, large, wealth transfers (the approach taken by GiveDirectly) and research that appeared most likely to affect our views of the evidence for this intervention. We relied heavily on studies and commentary on cash transfers that were sent to us by people who follow GiveWell. We also looked at the abstracts of studies cited by two papers by Chris Blattman231, which reported results from experiments involving large, unconditional cash transfers. In addition, we searched Google Scholar for studies with "cash transfers" in the title from 2011-2013. We listed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cash transfers in a spreadsheet and read the abstract for all studies to try to identify studies that might change our views on the intervention. We also looked for evidence on the propensity to invest cash transfers, returns to investment, inflation, economic effects on non-recipients, spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients.\n\n## Changes in our views\n\nIn general, the additional evidence we reviewed did not substantively change our assessment of the impact of cash transfers. We found little evidence that cash transfers caused inflation, negative economic effects on non-recipients, recipient spending on alcohol and tobacco, and community resentment or hostility toward recipients. The most significant updates to the evidence are results from a randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in Western Kenya. These results are broadly consistent with results measured in other cash transfer programs, but do suggest that GiveDirectly recipients may earn lower investment returns on their transfers than recipients in previously studied cash transfer programs. These results are particularly significant because they assess GiveDirectly\'s program itself. We continue to interpret other evidence for cash transfers cautiously, as most research examines programs that differ from GiveDirectly in that: 1) the transfers are conditional or framed heavily in terms of investment; 2) the transfers are 60% to 90% smaller than GiveDirectly\'s; 3) trainings or other services are provided alongside the transfers. We are not aware of any other studies of the propensity to invest large wealth transfers that were not framed as business grants, restricted to participants with investment proposals and/or provided alongside some form of business training or technical assistance.\n\n### Studies we considered\n\nA list of the studies reviewed for our initial report in 2012 is available above. A list of the research on cash transfers that we have seen between December 2012 and December 2013 is available at this footnote.232\n\nThis list includes all new RCTs we have seen but does not attempt to comprehensively list every non-RCT that has been published, instead focusing on studies most likely to affect our views.\n\n## 2014\n\nWe reviewed a list of studies and articles on cash transfers that we\'d come across or were sent to us throughout the year and conducted an informal search for additional studies that might substantively change our view on cash transfers. We did not find any study that passed that threshold and continue to rely on the studies identified in our last review. We think that (a) studies of large, unrestricted cash transfers or (b) studies that rigorously examine the negative effects of cash transfers could potentially change our view.\n\n## 2015\n\nWe primarily searched for new studies on (a) large, unconditional cash transfers and/or (b) the negative effects of cash transfers because we think these are the types of studies that would be most likely to affect our view of GiveDirectly\'s program.\n\n### New studies on large, unconditional cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on large, unconditional cash transfers, we (a) searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 that contained the keywords "Haushofer and Shapiro 2013" (without the quotes) or "GiveDirectly", (b) reviewed studies mentioned in a section of a World Bank blog post on education and cash transfers and (c) reviewed a list of studies sent to us by Paul Niehaus of GiveDirectly. We identified the following papers as warranting further investigation, but all of the studies differed enough from GiveDirectly\'s program that they did not substantively change our view:233\n\nHarris 2015 is an observational study comparing households in Ethiopia that received very large cash transfers (5x annual consumption expenditure on average) as compensation for the government taking a substantial portion of their land (70% on average) to households that did not get their land taken away.234\n\nBlattman, Jamison and Sheridan 2015 randomly assigned $200 grants (about 3 months wages) to criminally engaged Liberian men (some also received therapy).235\n\nEmergency Economics 2014 examined a program that provided cash transfers ($575 USD per household over 5 months) to Syrian refugees in Lebanon during the winter.236\n\nWe also found a published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) whereas we previously relied on the policy report (Blattman et al 2013). The updated analysis did not substantively change our view, but we have added a small update from the new analysis about the effects of WINGS on non-participating households in the relevant section above. Finally, we examined a pilot study run by GiveDirectly, which they had previously sent to us, that randomized young women to receive large, unconditional transfers.237 This pilot study did not substantively change our view because it had a very small sample size, differed from GiveDirectly\'s core program, and did not seem to analyze return on investment of transfers.238\n\n## New studies on the negative effects of cash transfers\n\nTo find new studies on the negative effects of cash transfers, we searched Google scholar for studies published since 2014 with "cash randomized, "cash randomised", "cash experimental", or "cash experiment" (all without the quotes) in the title. We culled the studies based on their titles.239 We skimmed the 5 remaining studies for discussion on any negative effects of the transfer programs.240 We identified one of the studies (White and Basu 2014) as warranting further investigation (based on a cursory look, none of the other studies reported negative effects). White and Basu 2014, which examined the effect of change in payment schedule for a cash transfer program in Peru on expenditures on temptation goods, did not substantively change our view because it did not, in our view, find meaningfully negative effects (see following footnote for details).241\n\nWe also looked for discussion of negative effects in the new studies of large, unconditional transfers that we identified as warranting further investigation. None of the studies reported findings on negative effects that substantively changed our view because either (a) they did not find meaningfully negative effects of transfers, or (b) the potential negative effects seemed to be unlikely to apply to GiveDirectly\'s program.242\n\nHaushofer, Reisinger and Shapiro 2015 was released after we finished the search described above. We wrote up our view of the study. For more information on our search for studies, see this spreadsheet.\n\n## Other studies\n\nWe de-prioritized further investigation of two RCTs examining the effect of cash transfers on cognitive development (Barham, Macours and Maluccio 2013 and Gilligan and Roy 2014), because it seemed that the conditionality (or perceived conditionality) of the transfers in both studies played a key role in the outcomes, which makes these studies less relevant to GiveDirectly\'s unconditional transfer program.243\n\n## 2017\n\nThroughout the year we tracked new literature that might be relevant to assessing the impact of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfer program by:\n\nSetting up alerts so that we were notified whenever new studies cited key studies such as Haushofer and Shapiro 2013. Reviewing papers that were sent to us or that were discussed by various development economics blogs and social media accounts that we follow. We did not find any studies that we thought warranted deeper investigation at this time. We would conduct a deeper investigation of a cash transfer study if, based on the abstract, it seemed that it might provide high-quality information about the humanitarian impacts of unconditional cash transfers in contexts similar to those in which GiveDirectly operates.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            Of the five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which look at the spillover effects of unconditional cash transfers on consumption in sub-Saharan African countries, three RCTs find substantial negative spillover effects, one RCT finds no spillover effects, and the GE study finds no or even a small positive spillover effect.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively.

GiveDirectly collaborates with a wide range of leading independent researchers to measure the impacts of cash transfers and answer complex design questions through more than a dozen randomized controlled trials. We report the results of our evaluations and also announce studies in progress before the data are in, so that we can be held accountable for the results. We also run smaller, non-experimental tests to learn more about what works best and how different types of recipients spend funds they receive. ## Published randomized controlled trial studies\n\n### The impact of unconditional cash transfers on poor households in rural Kenya\n\n**Researchers:**: Johannes Haushofer (Princeton) and Jeremy Shapiro (Princeton) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n**Location:**: Siaya County, Kenya\n**Overview:**: The study documented large, positive impacts of cash transfers averaging ~$500 across a wide range of outcomes including assets, earnings, food security, psychological well-being, and domestic violence, an average four months after transfers ended. It also examined a number of design questions such as how to size transfers and whether to give them to men or women. A second endline survey >2 years after the end of transfers found "cash transfers result in sustained increases in assets.

It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study\'s primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey.

It found that both programs increased productive hours, assets, savings, and subjective well-being. Only youth training improved business knowledge, and only cash transfers improved consumption, income, and wealth. When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), "cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge". The study found little evidence that combining cash with training improved cost-effectiveness, compared to delivering cash on its own. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. **Status:** Working paper published in 2020, second endline planned for early 2021\n\n**Media and blogs:** [Blog] What we\'ve learned by comparing cash to job training\n\n### How do cash transfers impact local economies? **Researchers:** Dennis Egger (UC Berkeley), Johannes Haushofer (Princeton), Ted Miguel (UC Berkeley), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Walker (UC Berkeley), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action. **Location:** Siaya County, Kenya\n\n**Overview:** This study found that the consumption expenditure and income increased for both people who received cash, and those who did not. Over the course of 27 months, the total economic impact of a $1,000 transfer was approximately $2,600 (a fiscal multiplier of about 2.6) when impacts for recipients and non-recipients are combined. There were also gains in psychological wellbeing, food security, education and security for recipients, and no significant negative impacts were recorded for non-recipients.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # No further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households.\n\n#### Mobile money partnership\n\nGiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN. A distributed cashout model allows recipients to withdraw their cash from any MTN agent at any time; under a payday model, recipients are told to assemble at a certain place and time to withdraw their cash. GiveDirectly believes that using distributed cashouts where possible is preferred. In Uganda, MTN is the mobile provider with the broadest distribution network, making it GiveDirectly's preferred partner. Previously GiveDirectly thought that a distributed cashout model would not be feasible in Uganda, as cell phone penetration is limited and recipients would have to travel long distances to reach mobile agents. This is why programs in Uganda began under a payday model. GiveDirectly is now trying to improve the effectiveness of the distributed cashout model in Uganda by communicating extensively with recipients about where agents are located.\n\n#### Kenya\n\n#### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly has nearly exhausted its ability to enroll households in Siaya County, although it would be possible to treat the control group in Siaya from the General Equilibrium (GE) study. The control households make up slightly less than half the eligible households in Siaya. However, GiveDirectly wants to maintain the Siaya control group as a control for long-term follow-up purposes, and it does not anticipate problems getting further approvals from the Kenyan government for work elsewhere. GiveDirectly has county-level approval to enroll approximately 70,000 more households in Kenya, the vast majority in Homa Bay County, but still needs approval from some specific districts before it can begin operating in them. However, previous approval for a district in Homa Bay County took only a few days to secure, so this should not be a barrier going forward.\n\n#### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will soon begin a $4 million study comparing cash transfers to other interventions in Rwanda. The study is funded by Google.org and a bilateral aid agency. GiveDirectly's funding partners have provided a list of potential programs against which to benchmark cash transfers. GiveDirectly is now narrowing down the list to the options that make most sense as a basis for comparison. In about two months, GiveDirectly expects to have more details about the study design and which program will be compared to cash transfers. In the future, GiveDirectly may invest its own funding in Rwanda for other cash transfer campaigns, but this depends largely on the total amount of funding it receives and on how GiveDirectly's work in Rwanda progresses.\n\n#### Modified criteria for eligibility\n\nThe presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.\n\nGiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data. Community-based targeting (which relies on reports from other community members about a household's status) has not thus far been a strategy that has performed well. GiveDirectly has found that different groups of respondents give very different answers, or that the same respondents will give very different answers on multiple tests.\n\n### Trustee and helper system\n\nTo help some recipients obtain their transfers, GiveDirectly has instituted a system of trustees and helpers. A trustee registers for a mobile money or a bank account on behalf of a recipient who cannot do so. This is usually because the recipient does not have a national ID and/or is either very old or too young (as in a child-headed household) to register for a money transfer modality. Trustees are chosen by asking recipient whom they most trust, ideally out of earshot of other family members who might try to take advantage of them. The selection is then validated through discussion with neighbors. GiveDirectly prefers naming trustees who are also transfer recipients, as this reduces any incentive to steal the transfer and GiveDirectly can re-direct the trustee's own transfers if any abuse of the relationship occurs. A helper is a position of lower responsibility. Helpers may be chosen for recipients who are very old or blind. The transfer can thus be registered in the recipient's name, but the helper retrieves the transfer or assists the recipient in using the phone.\n\n### Security risks\n\n#### Risk of targeting for robbery on cashout days\n\nLarge volumes of cash brought into villages on cashout days, making them a possible target for robbery. However, the banks or mobile money providers that GiveDirectly works with provide armored vehicles, security personnel, and valuable cash handling expertise for the cash out days.\n\n#### Risk due to increased prominence\n\nGiveDirectly does not anticipate increased risk of robbery as it becomes better known in the areas where it works. In Siaya in Kenya, GiveDirectly was extremely well known, so it seems unlikely that criminal activity in new areas where GiveDirectly is less recognized would be greater than it was in Siaya. However, likelihood of crime might vary from region to region. GiveDirectly does not consider security risk to be very high in Homa Bay County, but acknowledges that it could be more of a concern in an urban area. One of the benefits of the distributed cashout model is that it makes it easier to keep recipients' identities secret and therefore limit the potential for robbery. As part of its follow-up procedure, GiveDirectly asks recipients security-related questions, such as whether anyone knows that they are recipients and knew when they went to cash out, to monitor security risk.\n\n_Policy on reimbursing stolen transfers_\n\nWhen theft of a transfer occurs that is out of GiveDirectly's control, GiveDirectly generally does not reimburse the recipient, although it will try to help recover the money by negotiating with the thief or involving the police or local government.\n\n### Impact of research studies on GiveDirectly's activities\n\n#### Approach to incorporating research studies\n\nA large number of GiveDirectly's enrollees are now participants in one of several ongoing research studies. The model for some of these studies may be significantly different from GiveDirectly's regular campaigns (i.e., the transfer amounts may be higher or lower). When a study's model deviates significantly from the way GiveDirectly publicly presents its campaigns, GiveDirectly finds an independent source of funding and does not use any retail donations to finance the study. For example, one study was funded entirely by the Rockefeller Foundation. The ideas42 study, which also represented a substantial deviation from GiveDirectly's core model, was also independently funded. Examples of retail donation-funded research projects are the GE study and the forthcoming aspirations study, which both use the model described on GiveDirectly's website. GiveDirectly is now trying to include all of its recipients in either a study or a learning objective. Learning objectives are internal tests conducted by GiveDirectly in which the standard campaign model is slightly varies. GiveDirectly uses results from learning objective campaigns to gather information about how it might adjust its operating procedures (e.g., experimentation with proxy means tests).\n\n#### Research studies under rolling-campaign model\n\nThe rolling model is preferable in most ways to the discrete-campaign model. It allows GiveDirectly to employ people for longer than a few months at a time, and to operate more as an organization rather than a standalone project. Though it is not necessarily more difficult to incorporate a study into the rolling model, it does introduce some complexities. The rolling model places some pressure on academics to organize their studies in a way that fits into GiveDirectly's timeline. The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers. The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.\n\n### Operational updates\n\n#### Segovia platform\n\nGiveDirectly expects some efficiency gains from adopting Segovia, but no more than what could be expected from any upgrade in technology, such as an upgrade in finance software. GiveDirectly's chairman, Michael Faye, is the lead on Segovia, while Dr. Niehaus leads on GiveDirectly's work, and each provides occasional support to the other. Combined, the two of them dedicate the equivalent of two CEOs' hours to Segovia and GiveDirectly.\n\n#### US staffing\n\nTo help fill the general management position in its New York office, GiveDirectly has engaged a recruiter, which has supplied several candidates. Some of these are in late-stage conversations with GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has seen high interest in its open partnerships lead position, but identifying candidates with the right level of talent has been challenging. Recruiting for this role has been conducted mainly through networking. The candidates GiveDirectly has seen so far would likely take on more of a supporting role, assisting with analysis and strategy. GiveDirectly is also interested in a candidate who could explore more traditionally fundraising-oriented partnerships, such as corporate partnerships that could raise GiveDirectly's retail profile, as well as speak with family foundations and conduct more one-on-one discussions. Finding candidates for its open digital marketing and products position has also been a challenge, as quality talent in this field is in high demand. GiveDirectly's current management do not have many marketed-related contacts, but have started investigating personal networks more deeply. GiveDirectly has also enlisted another recruiter to help expand the pipeline of candidates.\n\n_All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            However, if this does not happen, GiveDirectly would still be able to continue enrolling recipients in Uganda for a couple of years, as Bukedea District alone contains approximately 27,000 households. #### Mobile money partnership\n\nGiveDirectly is testing a new partnership with Centenary Bank in Uganda to distribute its transfers, and is also conducting a pilot to test a distributed cashout model with its current partner, mobile provider MTN.

(2011) found comparable large effects on microenterprise profits for in-kind transfers (~20% return per month), but effects on business profits for cash were statistically indistinguishable from zero.96 As discussed above, this may be a result of recipients spending transfers in the household rather than investing in their businesses. A similar randomized controlled trial in Mexico, which gave cash or in-kind grants of about $140 to retail micro-enterprises (all owned by men and without paid employees), found returns to capital of 28 to 46% per month over a 3-12 month follow-up period, with indistinguishable differences between cash and in-kind grants.97 The biggest effects (~100% return per month) were concentrated within the 38% of micro-enterprises that were very credit-constrained.98 Although the\n\n=== Page 18 ===\n\neffects in the credit-constrained subgroup were large and precisely-estimated, the study suffered from substantial attrition (>50% in both treatment and control groups, with similar rates for the two), harming its power and calling the accuracy of the estimates into question.99\n\n### RCT of GiveDirectly's program\n\nWe place very high weight on the results of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, a publicly pre-registered, randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly's program in Rarieda, Western Kenya, because the intervention it evaluated was the most similar to GiveDirectly's standard program out of all of the RCTs we have seen and because it explicitly addressed issues related to selective reporting bias and multiple comparison problems.100 The trial differed from GiveDirectly's standard program in one key way: while GiveDirectly currently transfers $1,000 to program recipients, 72% of treatment group members in the evaluation received just $287, less than 30% of the standard amount (one smaller treatment arm did receive $1,085 transfers).101 When interpreting the results, we keep this difference in mind because we believe that the size of a transfer probably has substantial effects on the magnitude of its impact and its effect on recipients' behavior. ### How the program worked\n\nGiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.102 While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.103 Please see our review of GiveDirectly for much more detail on GiveDirectly's program. === Page 19 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013's evaluation of GiveDirectly was randomized on two levels: eligible villages were randomly sorted into treatment and control groups and eligible households within treatment villages were randomized again into treatment households and controls.104 Researchers were therefore able to calculate treatment effects by comparing treatment households to control households within treatment villages.105 They could also calculate the spillover effects the transfers had on non-recipients by comparing control households in treatment villages to otherwise similar households in control villages.106\n\nDifferent variations of the program were evaluated. Treatment households were cross-randomized into three arms, which varied the gender of the recipient (when households had both male and female household heads), the frequency of the transfer (lump-sum v. monthly installment), and the size of the transfer ($287 v. $1,085).107 The study measured short-term effects of the transfer.108 The time between end-line survey and receipt of final transfer ranged from zero months (for households still receiving transfers when they were surveyed) to fifteen months.109\n\n## Effects on GiveDirectly recipients\n\n72% of treatment group households in the evaluation received just $287; the rest received $1,085.100 In the sections below, we use the outcomes from the larger transfer group unless otherwise specified, because GiveDirectly typically gives transfers of similar size.11 For every outcome, the larger transfer led to more spending compared to the smaller transfer with a few exceptions, where we have noted the outcome for the smaller transfer group in the text, and for tobacco and alcohol and indices of health and education, where the effects were not statistically different from zero. Though we report transfer sizes in exchange-rate adjusted terms, we report the outcomes in purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted U.S. dollars.12\n\n=== Page 20 ===\n\n### How GiveDirectly transfers were spent\n\nResearchers collected data by surveying members of the treatment and control groups about their recent spending. All data that follows comes from participant self-reports. GiveDirectly recipients increased the value of their non-land assets and their monthly consumption.103 Their spending is broken down in more detail below. ##### Total non-land assets.104\n\nReceipt of large transfers increased households' non-land assets by an average of $463 (95% CI: $378 to $549).105 The largest categories of asset increases were livestock ($131, 95% CI: $79 to $183), durable goods ($100, 95% CI: $71 to $129; primarily furniture), and savings ($18, 95% CI: $9 to $27).106 Households receiving transfers (small or large) were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 17% to 29%) more likely to have an iron roof than the control households.107 Though Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 doesn't report the change in likelihood for recipients of large transfers alone, recipients of large transfers were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 13% to 33%) more likely to have iron roofs at end-line than recipients of small transfers.108 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 estimated that iron roofs cost about $564 USD PPP based on a survey of one respondent in each of 20 villages.109 GiveDirectly ran a survey that sampled a respondent from each of 20 villages and found that iron roofs cost $418 USD PPP on average.100 We do not know what explains this discrepancy. ##### Business expenses. Households receiving large transfers spent about $13 per month (95% CI: $1 to $25) more than control households on business expenses, which were primarily made up of non-durable expenses on non-agricultural businesses.102 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $13 more per month (95% CI: $4 to $22).102\n\n##### Health expenditures\n\nRecipients of large transfers spent about $3 (95% CI: -$1 to $6) per month more than control households on health expenditures.103 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $3 (95% CI: $1 to $5) more.104 This spending was also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below. ##### Education expenditures. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $1.89 (95% CI: $0.20 to $3.58) more than\n\n=== Page 21 ===\n\nthe control households on education expenditures and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $0.79 (95% CI: -$0.31 to $1.89) more.285 We're not sure of the time period over which this estimate is calculated. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 also reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $16.26 (95% CI: -$6.50 to $39.02) more than control households on education expenditures in the past month and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $19.41 (95% CI: -$12.22 to $44.74) more.286 We're not sure if the difference between the two estimates is due to the difference in the samples used to calculate them (they have different sample sizes) or the different time periods over which they might be calculated or some other explanation.287 Education expenditures were also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below. **Consumption. ** Treatment households consumed about $51 more per month (95% CI: $32 to $70) than control households.128 About half of this additional consumption was on food.129 This additional consumption also included increased spending on social expenditures and various other expenditures.130\n\n**Alcohol and tobacco. ** Treatment households did not increase their spending on alcohol or on tobacco.131\n\n### Impacts of GiveDirectly transfers on recipients\n\n**Food security. ** At baseline, food security was low among participants.132 Program participants reported a 0.37 standard deviation (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57) increase in a food security index over controls.133\n\n**Health and education. ** The study did not detect an effect on indices of health and educational outcomes.134\n\n**Revenue and profits. ** Receipt of large transfers lead to a $15 per month (95% CI: -$1 to $32) increase in total revenues and receipt of small transfers lead to a $17 (95% CI: $4 to $30) increase but neither resulted in a detectable increase in profits.135 We\n\n=== Page 22 ===\n\nemphasize that these are very short-run effects and we do not know whether participants' business investments might lead to profits in the longer run. Researchers also considered more subjective measures of impact on recipients' quality of life:\n\nPsychological well-being. Treatment improved an index of psychological wellbeing by 0.45 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.65).36 There was no observable effect on cortisol for the treatment group as a whole although cortisol, an indicator of stress, was slightly lower in the large transfer group than the small transfer group, a difference that was statistically significant at the 10% level when controls were included in the model.37\n\nFemale empowerment. Control households in treatment villages measure 0.23 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.41) higher on an index of female empowerment than control households in control villages.38 This suggests that cash transfers to a village unexpectedly empowered females in both recipient and non-recipient households. The researchers propose potential mechanisms for this effect, but are explicit that these measured results are surprising and warrant further investigation.39 Note that we report this result for the sake of comprehensiveness but would guess that it is more likely to be random than real. ### Spillover effects and village-level effects\n\n_Update (November 2018): We provide a more recent and detailed discussion of these effects below._\n\nOther than the potential positive effects on female empowerment. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 found no statistically significant spillover effects (i.e., effects on non-recipient households in recipient villages).140 However, imprecise and statistically insignificant point estimates suggest the possibility of moderate negative effects on non-recipient households.141\n\n=== Page 23 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nThe study found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, wages, or crime but estimates are imprecise.142\n\n## Program variations\n\nThe study did not find statistically discernible differences when it varied the gender of the recipient.143 There was some evidence suggesting that recipients of lump-sum transfers were more likely to purchase assets and recipients of monthly installments were more likely to spend their transfers on food.144\n\n### Limitations\n\nSpillover and village-level effects: differences from GiveDirectly's standard model. Large transfers might have very different spillover effects and village-level effects from small transfers. Spillover effects and village-level effects also might be larger in GiveDirectly's standard model, where all eligible households in treatment villages receive transfers, than in the RCT, where a control group within the village does not receive transfers. **Medium and long-term results. **Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is a short-term evaluation of GiveDirectly.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            A series of papers by de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff based on a randomized controlled trial of one-time grants to micro-enterprises in Sri Lanka have found large positive effects on profits for male owners.90 Approximately five years after initially making grants of $100-$200, divided between cash and in-kind gifts, to microenterprises that did not have any non-owner employees, the authors found $8-$12 higher monthly profits in male-owned businesses that received grants.91 This translates to a 6-12% monthly real return amongst male-owned businesses (with no measured benefits amongst businesses owned by women).92 In earlier work covering the first two years after the grants were made, the authors found similar monthly rates of return, and could not reject the hypothesis that cash and in-kind grants had similar effects on profits.93 During the first two years after the grants were made, the combined effect of the cash on men and women was large and statistically significant, though the returns for men were substantially larger than for women,94 but after five years, the combined effect for men and women appears to no longer be statistically significant (this is our conjecture; we cannot confirm it without examining the raw data and calculations for the study, which we have not done).95 In a similar randomized experiment conducted in Ghana, with a larger sample size and shorter follow-up period, Fafchamps et al.

GiveDirectly recipients increased the value of their non-land assets and their monthly consumption.103 Their spending is broken down in more detail below.\n\n##### Total non-land assets.104\n\nReceipt of large transfers increased households' non-land assets by an average of $463 (95% CI: $378 to $549).105 The largest categories of asset increases were livestock ($131, 95% CI: $79 to $183), durable goods ($100, 95% CI: $71 to $129; primarily furniture), and savings ($18, 95% CI: $9 to $27).106 Households receiving transfers (small or large) were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 17% to 29%) more likely to have an iron roof than the control households.107 Though Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 doesn't report the change in likelihood for recipients of large transfers alone, recipients of large transfers were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 13% to 33%) more likely to have iron roofs at end-line than recipients of small transfers.108 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 estimated that iron roofs cost about $564 USD PPP based on a survey of one respondent in each of 20 villages.109 GiveDirectly ran a survey that sampled a respondent from each of 20 villages and found that iron roofs cost $418 USD PPP on average.100 We do not know what explains this discrepancy.\n\n##### Business expenses.\n\nHouseholds receiving large transfers spent about $13 per month (95% CI: $1 to $25) more than control households on business expenses, which were primarily made up of non-durable expenses on non-agricultural businesses.102 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $13 more per month (95% CI: $4 to $22).102\n\n##### Health expenditures\n\nRecipients of large transfers spent about $3 (95% CI: -$1 to $6) per month more than control households on health expenditures.103 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $3 (95% CI: $1 to $5) more.104 This spending was also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below.\n\n##### Education expenditures.\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $1.89 (95% CI: $0.20 to $3.58) more than the control households on education expenditures and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $0.79 (95% CI: -$0.31 to $1.89) more.285 We're not sure of the time period over which this estimate is calculated. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 also reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $16.26 (95% CI: -$6.50 to $39.02) more than control households on education expenditures in the past month and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $19.41 (95% CI: -$12.22 to $44.74) more.286 We're not sure if the difference between the two estimates is due to the difference in the samples used to calculate them (they have different sample sizes) or the different time periods over which they might be calculated or some other explanation.287 Education expenditures were also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below.\n\n**Consumption.** Treatment households consumed about $51 more per month (95% CI: $32 to $70) than control households.128 About half of this additional consumption was on food.129 This additional consumption also included increased spending on social expenditures and various other expenditures.130\n\n**Alcohol and tobacco.** Treatment households did not increase their spending on alcohol or on tobacco.\n\n### Impacts of GiveDirectly transfers on recipients\n\n**Food security.** At baseline, food security was low among participants.132 Program participants reported a 0.37 standard deviation (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57) increase in a food security index over controls.133\n\n**Health and education.** The study did not detect an effect on indices of health and educational outcomes.134\n\n**Revenue and profits.** Receipt of large transfers lead to a $15 per month (95% CI: -$1 to $32) increase in total revenues and receipt of small transfers lead to a $17 (95% CI: $4 to $30) increase but neither resulted in a detectable increase in profits.135 We emphasize that these are very short-run effects and we do not know whether participants' business investments might lead to profits in the longer run. Researchers also considered more subjective measures of impact on recipients' quality of life:\n\nPsychological well-being. Treatment improved an index of psychological wellbeing by 0.45 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.65).36 There was no observable effect on cortisol for the treatment group as a whole although cortisol, an indicator of stress, was slightly lower in the large transfer group than the small transfer group, a difference that was statistically significant at the 10% level when controls were included in the model.37\n\nFemale empowerment. Control households in treatment villages measure 0.23 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.41) higher on an index of female empowerment than control households in control villages.38 This suggests that cash transfers to a village unexpectedly empowered females in both recipient and non-recipient households. The researchers propose potential mechanisms for this effect, but are explicit that these measured results are surprising and warrant further investigation.39 Note that we report this result for the sake of comprehensiveness but would guess that it is more likely to be random than real.\n\n### Spillover effects and village-level effects\n\n_Update (November 2018): We provide a more recent and detailed discussion of these effects below._\n\nOther than the potential positive effects on female empowerment. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 found no statistically significant spillover effects (i.e., effects on non-recipient households in recipient villages).140 However, imprecise and statistically insignificant point estimates suggest the possibility of moderate negative effects on non-recipient households.141\n\nThe study found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, wages, or crime but estimates are imprecise.142\n\n## Program variations\n\nThe study did not find statistically discernible differences when it varied the gender of the recipient.143 There was some evidence suggesting that recipients of lump-sum transfers were more likely to purchase assets and recipients of monthly installments were more likely to spend their transfers on food.144\n\n### Limitations\n\nSpillover and village-level effects: differences from GiveDirectly's standard model. Large transfers might have very different spillover effects and village-level effects from small transfers. Spillover effects and village-level effects also might be larger in GiveDirectly's standard model, where all eligible households in treatment villages receive transfers, than in the RCT, where a control group within the village does not receive transfers. **Medium and long-term results.** Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is a short-term evaluation of GiveDirectly.\n        ", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3.

Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            Compare the Original Text:\n            We did not deeply review studies of other kinds of cash transfer programs because we believed that if a study was not highly relevant to the core parameters driving our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly then it was unlikely to affect our decision making in 2017. We also believe that our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly is relatively robust since we estimate that a large portion of the humanitarian benefit of the intervention comes from temporarily raising recipients' consumption. === Page 44 ===\n\n9/10/2020\nWe expect to reevaluate our views on cash transfers when results from a large, new study of GiveDirectly's program are released; this study will assess the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers: see General Equilibrium Effects of Cash\n\n### Transfers in Kenya, AEA RCT Registry. We also edited the negative spillovers section of this report because we believe that the previous version of this section provided too many speculative caveats on the findings of potential negative effects. We plan to revisit this evidence in the future alongside the evidence from the general equilibrium study mentioned above to consider whether we should directly factor in negative effects to our cost-effectiveness analysis. ## 2018\n\nIn this May 2018 post, we explained that we were aware of recently released research which suggested that cash transfers may be less effective than we previously believed in two ways:\n\n1. Cash may have negative spillovers on non-recipient households who live close to recipient households. 2. The benefits of cash for recipients may fade quickly over time. We conducted a more thorough literature review on the spillover effects of cash transfers and shared our updated conclusions in November 2018. We concluded that our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. For more, see the full report. We plan to address the concern about the duration of benefits at a later date because we believe it has less potential to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis for cash transfers, for reasons that are explained in this post.24\n\n=== Page 45 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nSources\n\n=== Page 46 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\nFafchamps et al. 2011\n\nFiszbein and Schady 2009\n\nGertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012\n\nGilligan and Roy 2014\n\nGiveWell.

We also believe that our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly is relatively robust since we estimate that a large portion of the humanitarian benefit of the intervention comes from temporarily raising recipients' consumption.\n\nWe expect to reevaluate our views on cash transfers when results from a large, new study of GiveDirectly's program are released; this study will assess the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers: see General Equilibrium Effects of Cash Transfers in Kenya, AEA RCT Registry. We also edited the negative spillovers section of this report because we believe that the previous version of this section provided too many speculative caveats on the findings of potential negative effects. We plan to revisit this evidence in the future alongside the evidence from the general equilibrium study mentioned above to consider whether we should directly factor in negative effects to our cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn this May 2018 post, we explained that we were aware of recently released research which suggested that cash transfers may be less effective than we previously believed in two ways:\n\n1. Cash may have negative spillovers on non-recipient households who live close to recipient households.\n2. The benefits of cash for recipients may fade quickly over time.\n\nWe conducted a more thorough literature review on the spillover effects of cash transfers and shared our updated conclusions in November 2018. We concluded that our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. For more, see the full report. We plan to address the concern about the duration of benefits at a later date because we believe it has less potential to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis for cash transfers, for reasons that are explained in this post.24\n\nSources\n\nFafchamps et al. 2011\n\nFiszbein and Schady 2009\n\nGertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012\n\nGilligan and Roy 2014\n\nGiveWell.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output".

For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below.\n\nWe have seen five studies examining the extent to which people invest their cash transfers, leading to longer-term gains:\n\n**Gertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012** is a followup of a randomized rollout of the Oportunidades program in Mexico, in which the treatment group was randomly selected to receive conditional cash transfers a year and a half earlier than the control group. It finds that people in the treatment group saw faster increases in their ownership of farm assets like land, started more microenterprises-"mainly production of handcrafts for sale"-and ultimately saw ~5% higher consumption levels than those in the control group, even four years after the latter had been enrolled in the program.59 The authors estimate that 74% of transfers are consumed and 26% are invested, an estimate that we discuss in more depth below.60 They go on to say:61\n\nNote that our estimate of the [marginal propensity to consume] MPC is consistent with other estimates in developing countries. For example, Musgrove (1979) estimates MPCs of 0.881 for urban Colombia, 0.896 for urban Ecuador, and, 0.776 for urban Peru; and Bhalla (1979) reports an MPC of 0.61 for rural India. Moreover, its value is relatively high, which is suggestive that beneficiaries are perceiving the program as a permanent --as opposed to transitory--source of income: Paxson (1992) reports MPCs out of permanent income from 0.56 to 0.84, and MPCs out of transitory income ranging from 0.17 to 0.27 for a sample of rice farmers in Thailand. A randomized evaluation of the Nicaraguan _Red de Proteccion Social_, a conditional cash transfer program, did not find any change in investment (except in human capital) due to the cash transfers.62 However, the authors note that, "households are indeed following the recommendations of the program; that is, they are spending most of their income from the program on current (food and education) expenditures. "63\n\nA randomized evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), an ongoing unconditional cash transfer program, found that 87% of the transfer was consumed.64 The remaining 13% is not accounted for by the study, but the authors speculate that it may be invested.65 It could also have been saved (without investment), transferred to other individuals, or simply mismeasured.66 In a randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Sri Lanka, recipients reported that 58% of their unconditional grants were immediately invested in the business, another 12% was saved, and the remaining 30% was spent on household consumption, investment, or other uses.67 Measures of the impact of the grants on capital stock show more dramatic effects, suggesting that cash grants increase capital stock for the recipient\'s micro-enterprise by as much as 100% of the grant amount.68 A similar randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Ghana estimated that cash grants to women increased household spending by 50-80% of their value during the quarter following grant receipt and cash grants to men increased household spending by 33-50% of their value, though the estimate for men was not statistically significant. The variation in estimated spending, especially amongst women, arises from very high levels of household spending amongst relatively few individuals, though the results for women remain significant after truncating at various levels.69 The estimated effects of the cash grants on business capital stock were not statistically significant, but varied between roughly one third and one half of the transfer value for women and between roughly zero and 20% of the transfer value for men, depending on whether full or truncated values were used.70 Note, though, that the cash transfers by GiveDirectly are both larger and made to poorer individuals than any of the transfers discussed above: Economic theory and the citations quoted above from Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) suggest that larger, shorter term transfers are more likely to be invested than smaller, ongoing transfers, and comparing the results from the ongoing cash transfers and the business grants appears to bear this conclusion out, though the estimates overlap significantly. However, there is also a potential tradeoff with beneficiary wealth: poorer recipients are typically expected to consume more of a cash transfer, relative to wealthier individuals. This coincides with our worry that GiveDirectly\'s focus on targeting the poorest may be systematically targeting individuals who are less likely to invest or, if they do invest, to reap large returns.\n\n## What return on investment do cash-transfer recipients earn?\n\n_Note: the section below was originally published in December 2012. In September-October 2013, we searched for additional literature on this topic (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in which recipients earned substantially smaller returns. Two other new studies found high returns from unconditional cash grants with features encouraging investment.78 In November 2013, we updated this section to include results from these three studies._\n\n## A variant of GiveDirectly\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.72 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.73 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.74\n\nGiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.77 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.78 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is discussed in much more detail below.\n\n### Unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTwo studies of unconditional wealth transfers in Uganda both found high annual returns of 30%-39% on the original grant.79 Both of these programs included many features designed to encourage investment and improve returns, which distinguish them from GiveDirectly\'s intervention. The studies are discussed in more detail below.\n\n### Conditional cash transfers\n\nThe only randomized controlled trial of ongoing cash transfers that discusses the returns that recipients earn on their investments is based on the Dportunidades conditional cash transfer program in Mexico, described above.80 Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that, four years after the control group began to receive treatment and five and a half years after the treatment group began to receive transfers, the treatment group continued to have consumption 5.6% higher than the control group.81 This implies, by our calculation, a 1.7% monthly return, and a 21% annual return, on the transfers,82 which further implies a 3.6% monthly, and 42.6% annual, rate of return on investment.83 Using a different method, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that for every hundred dollars transferred more than two years ago, recipients continue to earn $1.60 per month in additional income, for an annual return of 19.2%, even though they estimate that only 26% of transfers are invested.84 Since only 26% of transfers are invested, this implies an even higher rate of return on _investments_, of roughly 75% per year, or 6% per month.85 In these calculations, the authors do not rely purely on the randomized comparison between the treatment and control group. Instead, they estimate current consumption as a result of current and past cumulative transfers, which depend both on the randomized roll-out of the program, and on the number, age, gender, and school attendance of the children in a family. While the number, age, and gender of children are plausibly exogenous (i.e. they are not influenced by current consumption), and thus can just be included in the regressions as controls, the school attendance of children in the family is endogenous: worse school attendance is likely to lead to both decreased transfers (since the conditions punish families for not sending children to school) and increased consumption, since children not in school may be more likely to work. For exogenous variation in the transfers, the authors use instruments consisting of the _maximum amount of transfers that the family could have received_ had their children had perfect attendance.86 This explains a large portion of the variation in actual transfers received, and is likely exogenous (i.e. maximum potential transfers are likely "as good as random" once family demographics are controlled for, and family demographics are likely not influenced by consumption). Regressing current consumption on the current transfers and cumulative transfers from previous years, the authors estimate that every $100 in current transfers translates into an additional $48.70 of reported spending during the past month, and every $100 in transfers from more than 2 years ago translates into an additional $1.50 of reported spending during the past month.87 However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the total effect because many students worked, causing both a reduction in transfers for them relative to the maximum possible and an increase in consumption for their families (through their wages).88 By assuming that maximum potential transfers influence current consumption only through actually received transfers, which seems plausible, (i.e. by using maximum potential transfers as an instrument for actual transfers) the authors estimate that $100 of actually received transfers this month increases consumption by $74, and $100 of actually received transfers from more than two years ago increases consumption this month by $1.60.89\n\nThe authors pursue this instrumental variables strategy, rather than just regressing current consumption on total realized transfers, because the realized transfers are negatively correlated with consumption because of the child labor effects of conditionality, which would lead to an underestimate of the effects of transfers. The three different estimates discussed for long-term annual returns on cash transfers are quite similar (20.4%, 18%, 19.2%), though the estimated returns on _investment_ differ significantly (42.6%, 35%, 73.8%), because of different estimates of how much of the transfers are consumed.\n\n## Business grants\n\nThese estimated returns seem quite high, but there is a separate literature on the returns to capital in micro-enterprises that is relevant to this issue. In a series of experiments in Sri Lanka, Mexico, and Ghana, researchers giving grants on the order of $100 to micro-enterprises without any paid employees have found high returns on investment, in the range of 6%-46% _per month_.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of_\n\n=== Page 11 ===\n\n9/10/2020\n\n_GiveDirectly\'s program.

"63\n\n=== Page 12 ===\n\nA randomized evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC), an ongoing unconditional cash transfer program, found that 87% of the transfer was consumed.64 The remaining 13% is not accounted for by the study, but the authors speculate that it may be invested.65 It could also have been saved (without investment), transferred to other individuals, or simply mismeasured.66 In a randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Sri Lanka, recipients reported that 58% of their unconditional grants were immediately invested in the business, another 12% was saved, and the remaining 30% was spent on household consumption, investment, or other uses.67 Measures of the impact of the grants on capital stock show more dramatic effects, suggesting that cash grants increase capital stock for the recipient\'s micro-enterprise by as much as 100% of the grant amount.68 A similar randomized study of unconditional grants to micro-enterprises without any paid employees in Ghana estimated that cash grants to women increased household spending by 50-80% of their value during the quarter following grant receipt and cash grants to men increased household spending by 33-50% of their value, though the estimate for men was not statistically significant. The variation in estimated spending, especially amongst women, arises from very high levels of household spending amongst relatively few individuals, though the results for women remain significant after truncating at various levels.69 The estimated effects of the cash grants on business capital stock were not statistically significant, but varied between roughly one third and one half of the transfer value for women and between roughly zero and 20% of the transfer value for men, depending on whether full or truncated values were used.70 Note, though, that the cash transfers by GiveDirectly are both larger and made to poorer individuals than any of the transfers discussed above: Economic theory and the citations quoted above from Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) suggest that larger, shorter term transfers are more likely to be invested than smaller, ongoing transfers, and comparing the results from the\n\n=== Page 13 ===\n\nongoing cash transfers and the business grants appears to bear this conclusion out, though the estimates overlap significantly. However, there is also a potential tradeoff with beneficiary wealth: poorer recipients are typically expected to consume more of a cash transfer, relative to wealthier individuals. This coincides with our worry that GiveDirectly\'s focus on targeting the poorest may be systematically targeting individuals who are less likely to invest or, if they do invest, to reap large returns. ## What return on investment do cash-transfer recipients earn? _Note: the section below was originally published in December 2012. In September-October 2013, we searched for additional literature on this topic (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program in which recipients earned substantially smaller returns. Two other new studies found high returns from unconditional cash grants with features encouraging investment.78 In November 2013, we updated this section to include results from these three studies._\n\n## A variant of GiveDirectly\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.72 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.73 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.74\n\n=== Page 14 ===\n\nGiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.77 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.78 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is discussed in much more detail below. ### Unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTwo studies of unconditional wealth transfers in Uganda both found high annual returns of 30%-39% on the original grant.79 Both of these programs included many features designed to encourage investment and improve returns, which distinguish them from GiveDirectly\'s intervention. The studies are discussed in more detail below. ### Conditional cash transfers\n\n=== Page 15 ===\n\nThe only randomized controlled trial of ongoing cash transfers that discusses the returns that recipients earn on their investments is based on the Dportunidades conditional cash transfer program in Mexico, described above.80 Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that, four years after the control group began to receive treatment and five and a half years after the treatment group began to receive transfers, the treatment group continued to have consumption 5.6% higher than the control group.81 This implies, by our calculation, a 1.7% monthly return, and a 21% annual return, on the transfers,82 which further implies a 3.6% monthly, and 42.6% annual, rate of return on investment.83 Using a different method, Gertler, Martinez, and Rubio-Codina (2012) estimates that for every hundred dollars transferred more than two years ago, recipients continue to earn $1.60 per month in additional income, for an annual return of 19.2%, even though they estimate that only 26% of transfers are invested.84 Since only 26% of transfers are invested, this implies an even higher rate of return on _investments_, of roughly 75% per year, or 6% per month.85 In these calculations, the authors do not rely purely on the randomized comparison between the treatment and control group. Instead, they estimate current consumption as a result of current and past cumulative transfers, which depend both on the randomized roll-out of the program, and on the number, age, gender, and school attendance of the children in a family. While the number, age, and gender of children are plausibly exogenous (i.e. they are not influenced by current consumption), and thus can just be included in the regressions as controls, the school attendance of children in the family is endogenous: worse school attendance is likely to lead to both decreased transfers (since the conditions punish families for not sending children to school) and increased consumption, since children not in school may be more likely to work. For exogenous variation in the transfers, the authors use instruments consisting of the _maximum amount of transfers that the family could have received_ had their children had perfect attendance.86 This explains a large portion of the variation in actual transfers received, and is likely exogenous (i.e. maximum potential transfers are\n\n=== Page 16 ===\n\nlikely "as good as random" once family demographics are controlled for, and family demographics are likely not influenced by consumption). Regressing current consumption on the current transfers and cumulative transfers from previous years, the authors estimate that every $100 in current transfers translates into an additional $48.70 of reported spending during the past month, and every $100 in transfers from more than 2 years ago translates into an additional $1.50 of reported spending during the past month.87 However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the total effect because many students worked, causing both a reduction in transfers for them relative to the maximum possible and an increase in consumption for their families (through their wages).88 By assuming that maximum potential transfers influence current consumption only through actually received transfers, which seems plausible, (i.e. by using maximum potential transfers as an instrument for actual transfers) the authors estimate that $100 of actually received transfers this month increases consumption by $74, and $100 of actually received transfers from more than two years ago increases consumption this month by $1.60.89\n\nThe authors pursue this instrumental variables strategy, rather than just regressing current consumption on total realized transfers, because the realized transfers are negatively correlated with consumption because of the child labor effects of conditionality, which would lead to an underestimate of the effects of transfers. The three different estimates discussed for long-term annual returns on cash transfers are quite similar (20.4%, 18%, 19.2%), though the estimated returns on _investment_ differ significantly (42.6%, 35%, 73.8%), because of different estimates of how much of the transfers are consumed. ## Business grants\n\nThese estimated returns seem quite high, but there is a separate literature on the returns to capital in micro-enterprises that is relevant to this issue. In a series of experiments in Sri Lanka, Mexico, and Ghana, researchers giving grants on the order\n\n=== Page 17 ===\n\nof $100 to micro-enterprises without any paid employees have found high returns on investment, in the range of 6%-46% _per month_.\n            </Original Text>\n        ', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly\'s Ugandan program, GiveDirectly\'s capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members. GiveDirectly prepared a written update to accompany this conversation, which is available here:\n\nhttp://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/20140904%20GD%20-%20GV%20check%20in.pdf\n\n## Ugandan fraud case\n\n### Nature of the fraud\n\nThere were three key people involved in the fraud:\n\n* GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process\n* GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls\n* Agents from the mobile money providers\n\nThe fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays. === Page 2 ===\n\n## Discovery of the fraud\n\n1. A GiveDirectly recipient had given their SIM card to the SFO (whose contract had been terminated in April due to an unrelated issue involving a fraudulent receipt he brought to GiveDirectly for reimbursement). The recipient asked the SFO to replace his SIM card (recipients have to travel about 4 hours round trip to get this done) and the SFO had not returned it. This report was made to the hotline that the OM was answering three months after the recipient had given over their SIM card. Mr. Skeates audits the logs of these hotline calls. 2. GiveDirectly had been planning a full round of follow-up surveys as part of its normal process, but accelerated the follow-up surveys in response to this issue. GiveDirectly\'s backcheck team paused their work on enrollment for the Uganda 2M campaign and called all the recipients in that village (Kosile) to ask whether they had received all of their transfers, had any problems withdrawing, and whether GiveDirectly currently had any of their documents (e.g., SIM cards, IDs). 3. During this process, there were some reports of problems during paydays. Recipients were initially hesitant to come forward. 4. Because of the reports of payday problems, GiveDirectly began calling another village, Kawo, the following day to gather more information. Recipients in Kawo were far more forthcoming with information when asked specific questions about payday problems. 5. GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO\'s and OM\'s dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages. Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud:\n\n* Because GiveDirectly\'s Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage. * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not. ## GiveDirectly\'s reaction to the fraud\n\nAt the time of the fraud\'s discovery, GiveDirectly had recently finished registering a new, $2 million cohort for the Uganda 2M campaign. The fraud occurred during the final round of payments in the previous campaign. Consequently, the fraud did not significantly affect GiveDirectly\'s capacity to move money in Uganda. The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans. === Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly filed an initial police report and gave transfer recipients the option of submitting testimonies to police. (GiveDirectly left this optional because it did not want to give the police a list of its recipients.) GiveDirectly is waiting to see what the Ugandan police will be able to do before deciding whether to reimburse recipients who had money stolen, in order to avoid having recipients doubly reimbursed by both the police and by GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:\n\n* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly\'s larger network in Kenya is already structured this way. * Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month). * Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts. * Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer. * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case. GiveDirectly currently has five Senior Field Officers (SFOs) in Kenya and one in Uganda. A Field Officer in Uganda was promoted to SFO to replace the SFO involved in the fraud, and an interim SFO was brought in from Kenya to work in Uganda for one month to help the Ugandan team recover. SFOs report directly to the Field Director. There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly\'s process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks). The payment agency is conducting its own disciplinary process. GiveDirectly will not be working with the payment agent involved in the fraud again. Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly\'s Chief Operating Officer, International, has suggested having cameras present to take pictures as people receive their transfers. Segovia\'s work will enable better fraud detection and greater data transparency, which will be especially important as GiveDirectly\'s scale increases. Other instances of fraud GiveDirectly has experienced include:\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n* Isolated incidents of M-Pesa agents asking for bribes or higher percentage fees for processing transactions. * Village Elders claiming to have brought GiveDirectly to their village or to have gotten a particular recipient on GiveDirectly\'s list and asking the recipient(s) for a gift in return. * There are likely some transfer recipients who are falsely claiming to live in structures that would make them eligible for GiveDirectly\'s program. ### Government approvals\n\nGiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government\'s requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government\'s formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly\'s work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly\'s recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly\'s work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it. GiveDirectly worked with a person in the office of the president in Nairobi who may be a useful contact for GiveDirectly in the future. GiveDirectly\'s work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly\'s agenda has no political or ethnic bias. ### Capacity to expand\n\nGiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program. GiveDirectly has worked in one and received approval to work in a second (Ugunja Division). It took 2.5 months to get this approval. Ugunja has room for about $3 million1 in transfer opportunities (given that half of the villages need to be set aside for controls in the general equilibrium study [see below]). Footnote 1: 83 non-control villages * 90 households/village * 40% eligibility * $1,000/household = $2,988,000. In Uganda, GiveDirectly renewed both national registration and Bukedea District-specific registration for one year. The amount GiveDirectly moves in that year will\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\ndepend more on fundraising than on approvals. Bukedea has room for about $23 million2 in transfer opportunities. It took about a month to get Bukedea approval. Footnote 2: 115 villages GiveDirectly has not been to * 200 eligible households/village * $1,000/household = $23,000,000. Currently, GiveDirectly is enrolling about $1 million-worth of new recipients per month. GiveDirectly is planning to meet with the governor of Kakamega, who is preparing to implement a $2 million Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program. There has recently been significant devolution in Kenya, and money previously controlled by the federal government has been given to county governors to allocate. This potentially creates opportunities for GiveDirectly to work with the government and offer advice on how to use these funds effectively. GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly\'s Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program. Cash transfers currently fund private goods. GiveDirectly is considering experimenting with a system whereby transfer recipients could propose public goods projects and individuals could pool their resources to fund projects they consider worthwhile. GiveDirectly has discussed this general idea with the Rockefeller Foundation. ## Research\n\n### General equilibrium (GE) long-term study\n\nThis long-term study is currently a major fundraising priority. GiveDirectly has raised $8 million in funding of a needed $15 million to maximize the research\'s impact. Ted Miguel (University of California) and Johannes Haushofer (Princeton University) will both serve as principal investigators for the study. Professor Miguel has done similar long-term research on de-worming. The study will be randomized at the village level and will focus on macro-level effects (e.g., changes in prices, new businesses created, etc.).\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **A conversation with Paul Niehaus of GiveDirectly on September 5, 2014**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Director and President, GiveDirectly\n* Elie Hassenfeld - Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director, GiveWell\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Ben Rachbach - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note:** This set of notes was compiled by GiveWell and gives an overview of the major points made by Dr. Niehaus.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with GiveDirectly as part of its process for staying up-to-date on top charities. Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly\'s Ugandan program, GiveDirectly\'s capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members. GiveDirectly prepared a written update to accompany this conversation, which is available here:\n\nhttp://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/20140904%20GD%20-%20GV%20check%20in.pdf\n\n## Ugandan fraud case\n\n### Nature of the fraud\n\nThere were three key people involved in the fraud:\n\n* GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process\n* GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls\n* Agents from the mobile money providers\n\nThe fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays.\n\n## Discovery of the fraud\n\n1. A GiveDirectly recipient had given their SIM card to the SFO (whose contract had been terminated in April due to an unrelated issue involving a fraudulent receipt he brought to GiveDirectly for reimbursement). The recipient asked the SFO to replace his SIM card (recipients have to travel about 4 hours round trip to get this done) and the SFO had not returned it. This report was made to the hotline that the OM was answering three months after the recipient had given over their SIM card. Mr. Skeates audits the logs of these hotline calls.\n2. GiveDirectly had been planning a full round of follow-up surveys as part of its normal process, but accelerated the follow-up surveys in response to this issue. GiveDirectly\'s backcheck team paused their work on enrollment for the Uganda 2M campaign and called all the recipients in that village (Kosile) to ask whether they had received all of their transfers, had any problems withdrawing, and whether GiveDirectly currently had any of their documents (e.g., SIM cards, IDs).\n3. During this process, there were some reports of problems during paydays. Recipients were initially hesitant to come forward.\n4. Because of the reports of payday problems, GiveDirectly began calling another village, Kawo, the following day to gather more information. Recipients in Kawo were far more forthcoming with information when asked specific questions about payday problems.\n5. GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO\'s and OM\'s dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages. Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud:\n   * Because GiveDirectly\'s Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage.\n   * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not.\n\n## GiveDirectly\'s reaction to the fraud\n\nAt the time of the fraud\'s discovery, GiveDirectly had recently finished registering a new, $2 million cohort for the Uganda 2M campaign. The fraud occurred during the final round of payments in the previous campaign. Consequently, the fraud did not significantly affect GiveDirectly\'s capacity to move money in Uganda. The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans.\n\nGiveDirectly filed an initial police report and gave transfer recipients the option of submitting testimonies to police. (GiveDirectly left this optional because it did not want to give the police a list of its recipients.) GiveDirectly is waiting to see what the Ugandan police will be able to do before deciding whether to reimburse recipients who had money stolen, in order to avoid having recipients doubly reimbursed by both the police and by GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:\n\n* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff).

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3.

While we were able to adjust estimated returns to subtract out the effects of follow-up by AVSI workers, doing so also increases our uncertainty about the magnitude of returns. ##### Demographics\n\nWINGS participants were chosen as the most vulnerable members of their communities, while GiveDirectly transfers cash to about 40% of the households in a given village.207This could lead WINGS to have higher returns than GiveDirectly (if the poorest of the poor have the greatest credit constraints and therefore the greatest returns to capital) or could lead GiveDirectly to have higher returns (if the poorest of the poor have worse spending opportunities or make worse spending decisions). ##### Grant size\n\nWINGS\' grant of $150 is only 15% the size of GiveDirectly\'s $1,000 transfers. This could lead to GiveDirectly recipients achieving a higher or lower return on their transfers than WINGS recipients. This difference could also lead to differing effects on inflation and on village-wide economies. ##### Long-run effects and divestment\n\nThe longest run effects measured by Blattman et al 2013 were eighteen months. Our return on investment calculations assume that\n\n=== Page 32 ===\n\nearnings gains sustained over eighteen months are permanent and we would guess that these earnings gains are maintained in the long-term. However, households may gradually divest from their investments, causing temporary earnings gains. **Conflicting data on investment spending. **Blattman et al 2013 measures investment spending in two ways: 1) by asking grant recipients to estimate the portion of their grant that they spent on business expenditures; and 2) by surveying treatment and control households on their expenditures over the course of a month and comparing investment by treatment households against investment by controls.208 These methods result in very different estimates of investment spending, which leave us very uncertain about the proportion of grants that were invested and also decrease our certainty in the reliability of the study\'s (self-reported) survey data on the whole. **Incomplete description of methodology. **Blattman et al 2013 is a policy brief and does not contain the complete methodological description that we would ideally like to see in order to evaluate a study. For example, the study does not describe how data on participants\' net earnings or savings are measured. We believe that accurately measuring earnings and savings among the very poor is difficult so our uncertainty about this data somewhat reduces our confidence in our ROI estimates. ## Our interpretation of studies of unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTogether, Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 provide strong evidence that cash grants of about $150 to $600 to groups of poor applicants and to very poor, uneducated women with business training and business plans can lead to high returns in the medium-term. Blattman et al 2013 also provides some of the most relevant evidence we\'ve seen suggesting that hostility from neighbors is not a major\n\n=== Page 33 ===\n\nproblem for most recipients of cash transfers and that cash transfers do not cause inflation. However, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013\'s evaluation of GiveDirectly itself found much smaller business returns. We believe that some combination of GiveDirectly\'s lack of a business plan requirement, lack of business skills training, and broader age-range of participants is the best explanation for the apparently lower returns earned by its participants. However, it is also possible that the failure to find investment returns was caused by the shorter time horizon of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 and GiveDirectly participants\' investments may still mature. ## Cost-effectiveness of cash transfers\n\nSee the most recent version of our cash cost-effectiveness analysis on this page. In practice, these calculations are sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding:\n\nthe investment returns to cash transfers;\n\nthe subjective assessment of the relative value of averting child mortality and improving incomes for adults. We estimate that cash transfer programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. === Page 34 ===\n\n# What are the potential downsides of the intervention? There are a few potential adverse effects of cash transfers:\n\nInflation: a sudden injection of cash into an area may cause inflation. We reviewed four randomized controlled trials investigating this issue:\n\nIn Programa de Apoyo Alimentario, an un-monitored conditional cash transfer program, no significant effect on inflation was found. The researchers used surveys of stores and households to measure prices of goods at baseline and one year after cash transfers began.209 The reported prices were 2.7% higher in villages receiving cash transfers than in control villages after one year, though the increases were not statistically significant.200 We do not have a clear understanding of how the authors picked the prices they reported from the larger universe of prices they collected.201\n\nA randomized study of the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program finds small increases in prices of 5 of 36 food items for sale in treatment villages immediately following deployment of the cash transfers.202 Although the authors do not observe meaningful increases in prices, they do find positive externalities of cash transfers on ineligible families in treatment villages, equivalent to ~10% of consumption (which is about 2/3 of the benefits experienced by the eligible families in the treatment villages).203\n\nBlattman et al 2013, the study of WINGS in Uganda, found evidence of a slight decrease in village-wide prices.204\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, but estimates are imprecise and may not rule out the possibility of substantial inflation.205\n\n=== Page 35 ===\n\n### Cash transfers could discourage wage-earning work by adults. If adults can control the distribution of their work and leisure time, cash transfers may lead them to substitute some leisure for work, leading to a decrease in wages earned (but most likely not a decrease in overall income). A World Bank review of the evidence on cash transfers (which we have not vetted) examines this question and concludes that transfers "appear to have had, at most, modest disincentives for adult work"; it discusses 5 studies, of which 4 found no impact along this dimension.26\n\nBlattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 both found that cash transfers with features encouraging investment _increased_ hours worked by recipients.27Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found evidence of a $17/month increase in recipients\' total revenue, which suggests that did not decrease their hours worked.28\n\nNote that there is substantially more evidence suggesting that conditional cash transfer programs lead to reductions in _child_ labor,29 which may help explain the gap between transfer sizes and observed increases in consumption.220\n\n### Giving cash to some and not others could possibly cause social unrest. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no significant effects of transfers on the rate of crime in treatment villages221 or on instances of physical, sexual, or emotional violence in treatment households as compared to control households in treatment villages.222 In Blattman et al 2013, recipients reported a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.223 We have not seen any other rigorous evidence discussing this issue. ### Diversion of transfers to wealthier individuals. It\'s not clear to us whether this problem would be more or less of an issue in the case of cash transfers than in-kind transfers, and we would guess that the extent of the problem depends heavily on the method of making transfers. Our review of GiveDirectly discusses the extent to which this appears to have been a problem in their distributions. === Page 36 ===\n\n## Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients? We revisited the relevant evidence on this question and shared our updated analysis in November 2018. We concluded:\n\nGiveDirectly, one of our top charities, provides cash transfers to extremely low-income households. We wrote in May 2018 about new research on potential "negative spillover" effects of cash transfers: i.e., negative effects that cash transfers might have on people who live nearby transfer recipients. At that time, we wrote that we would reassess this evidence when we had results from GiveDirectly\'s "general equilibrium" (GE) study, which we expected to play a major role in our conclusions because it is the largest and highest quality study on spillover effects that we are aware of. We have now seen private draft results from the GE study. In brief, it did not find negative spillover effects of cash transfers. Considering the GE study alongside other relevant studies of the spillover effects of cash transfers, it appears that the overall evidence base is mixed.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **After subtracting out the effects of follow-up visits by AVSI staff, we estimate that the other components of WINGS increased beneficiaries\' monthly net earnings by an average of about $4.49/month.197 From these earnings numbers we can estimate a mean monthly return on investment of about 3.0% and a mean annual return on investment of about 35.9% on the original $150 grant.198 These calculations are an overestimate of the return on the grant itself, however, because they include the benefits but not the (quite high) costs of services like business skills training, targeting and disbursement, and (for some recipients) group dynamics training.199 We cannot confidently disentangle the effects of the $150 grant from the effects of the add-on services.**\n\n**Other economic effects.**  \nParticipation in WINGS increased short-term spending, wealth, and savings.200\n\n**Inflation, economic externalities, and general equilibrium effects.**  \nResearchers surveyed randomly chosen non-participant households in treatment and control villages in order to measure WINGS\' effects on non-participants (who made up 75%-85% of households in treatment villages).201 By going into trade and increasing the supply of scarce goods, WINGS recipients appear to have created slightly lower prices for all village members.202 Blattman et al 2013 suggests that WINGS led to decreased profits for existing microentrepreneurs (through enhanced competition) and increased wages and income for non-participating agricultural workers (through reduced supply of agricultural labor as WINGS participants work less on others households\' plots).203 The published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) suggests that WINGS had little effect on the incomes or occupational choice of nonparticipating households.204 We have not attempted to reconcile these findings though it seems like the updated analysis makes a weaker claim about negative effects on nonparticipants than the policy report and it strikes us as reasonable to rely on the updated analysis.\n\n#### Hostility towards recipients\n\nOverall, recipients report a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.205\n\n##### Health and social impacts\n\nDespite large economic returns, WINGS led to few observable medium-run health and social improvements for participants.206\n\n##### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from WINGS to GiveDirectly\'s program.\n\n##### Business plan requirement\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which the requirement to have a business plan approved encouraged participants to invest more money at higher returns than they would have in the absence of such a requirement.\n\n##### Disentangling program elements\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which WINGS\' business skills training and group dynamics training may have contributed to positive outcomes.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            No errors found.

Conversation topics included GiveDirectly\'s goals for 2016, deprioritized areas of work, budget allocation, impact on charitable giving and development assistance, and operations updates.\n\n## Goals for 2016\n\n### Doubling non-Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to approximately double the amount of non-Good Ventures funding it receives, from about $25 million in 2015 to $50-55 million this year. This is because GiveDirectly would prefer not to assume that the Good Ventures funding is ongoing from year to year.\n\n### Advancing institutional partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to finalize its next two major partnerships this year. However, the likelihood of this will largely depend on how quickly these potential institutional partners are able to act. Currently GiveDirectly is prioritizing the largest donors in the international aid sector. If GiveDirectly is able to hire a partnerships manager in the near future, it may begin to look at the next tier of funders. Through these partnerships, GiveDirectly aims to influence the movement of official development assistance towards more cost-effective programs. It also hopes to have a similar effect on retail donations in the US, and on the actions of NGOs.\n\n### Testing a basic income guarantee program\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to launch a test of a program that would guarantee a basic income to participants over the course of several years. The idea for a universal basic income has gained some traction around the world but has never been done in its full form and evaluated, so GiveDirectly believes this is a good time to test it.\n\nGiveDirectly has not yet finalized the amount of the basic income it would provide through this program. GiveDirectly wants the income to provide a meaningful level of support. The amount will likely be between 25 cents and just over $1 per day. The income would be transferred in regular installments over at least ten years. While a full universal basic income would not be feasible at the present time in some of the least developed countries because of budget constraints, there are other countries where it would be feasible. GiveDirectly also believes that the experiment will still be policy relevant even to budget-constrained country governments, as there are many potential variations that would be feasible (e.g., versions targeted to particular regions). GiveDirectly will study the impacts, many of which they expect to see in the first few years of the program.\n\n### Doubling field staff capacity and hiring for future growth\n\nIn 2016, GiveDirectly would like to double the amount of money moved through its cash transfer programs. It also intends to conduct additional hiring and planning so that it can double its capacity again in 2017. GiveDirectly finds that its rate of growth is one of the most important factors affecting its ability to recruit and hire talent for more senior positions. It also believes that this growth is an important factor in driving the policy impacts it seeks to have by generating attention on GiveDirectly\'s model and on the questions that model raises for other, existing interventions.\n\n### Testing program variations\n\nGiveDirectly would also like to test two different approaches to its cash transfer distribution process:\n\n* **Methods for cash transfer distribution in areas lacking mobile-payment infrastructure**, including areas with few mobile-payment agents. GiveDirectly does not plan to create its own payment infrastructure. Instead, it would likely try a model incorporating two approaches:\n  * Alerting mobile-money agents in other areas to opportunities in the areas lacking payment infrastructure. These agents would then travel on their own to the low-infrastructure areas to help transfer recipients cash out.\n  * Enlisting community members in low-infrastructure areas to become informal agents by collecting others\' vouchers and taking them all to be cashed out at once.\n* **A higher throughput, lower-cost program in which participants interact less frequently with GiveDirectly.** The current program is very high-quality and high-cost. For example, recipients typically interact with GiveDirectly four times in person and four times by phone. One variation that GiveDirectly might test is removing the backcheck step and conducting only the audit step for some recipients. This may slightly increase the risk of fraud, but would simplify the checking process, lower costs and enable faster enrollment.\n\n### Deprioritized areas for 2016\n\n#### Generic outreach to foundations\n\nGiveDirectly has been deprioritizing foundation outreach unrelated to specific projects for approximately the last year.\n\n#### Other learning projects\n\nGiveDirectly has deprioritized several learning projects that it concluded were not as important as the basic income guarantee experiment, such as distributing cash transfers in an urban setting or providing cash transfers to sex workers.\n\n#### Partnerships with combined funding/implementing organizations\n\nGiveDirectly is often approached by organizations such as UNICEF and World Food Programme (WFP) to provide assistance with running a cash transfer program or program component. However, GiveDirectly has generally chosen not to enter into such partnerships with organizations that are not the ultimate funders of international aid. The ultimate funders of aid programs are usually national governments, which then fund the World Bank and UN organizations.\n\n#### 2016 budget allocations\n\n##### Allocation of funds across countries\n\nGiveDirectly hopes to increase capacity and funding for its Uganda operations to the level it has reached in Kenya. However, the Ugandan government has proposed regulations around NGO activity in the country that might make it more difficult for NGOs to operate. In part because of this development, in a departure from its original plan, GiveDirectly has decided to allocate some retail donor funds for cash transfers in Rwanda along with funding for its partnership project there. This is so that Rwanda can serve as an additional country to invest in if the climate in Uganda becomes less favorable.\n\n##### Marketing budget\n\nFor both retail marketing and partnership projects, GiveDirectly plans to spend approximately $3-4 million, depending on when various personnel are hired.\n\n##### Good Ventures funding\n\nIf progress on partnership discussions is not satisfactory, GiveDirectly may dedicate some Good Ventures funding to other projects, such as the basic income guarantee program or some of the previously deprioritized learning projects described above. A third option would be further investment in building capacity in Rwanda.\n\n##### Room for more funding\n\nCurrently GiveDirectly has the capacity needed to move the amount of funding it has secured and what it estimates it will receive in the future. If GiveDirectly had substantially greater funding, it would have to decide whether to hire more staff to expand its capacity, or redirect some of its existing staff\'s time away from more complex projects and operations and onto a simpler method of distributing cash transfers. Additional funding would likely be allocated to standard cash transfers in Kenya, Uganda, or Rwanda. The basic income guarantee program will allow for a higher volume of cash distributed by each field director, since by its nature it commits a larger amount of money to each participant than the standard cash transfer programs.\n\n### GiveDirectly\'s broader impact on the aid sector\n\nGiveDirectly conducts three activities that it believes may broadly affect aid policy:\n\n* Routine cash transfers funded by retail donors\n* Experimental cash transfers evaluated by outside researchers\n* Cash transfers delivered through a strategic partnership with an institutional funder. Dr. Niehaus believes that strategic partnerships may be the most influential of these three activities, but its impact is also the hardest to measure.\n\n### Indirect impact on institutional policy through diffuse channels\n\nThere is currently an ongoing debate within the UN over how cash transfers might be incorporated into humanitarian aid, as the present system is largely built around in-kind assistance such as food, clothing, and shelter. Cash does not have an obvious place in the existing system. However, Dr. Niehaus believes that significant impact may come first through indirect influence of high-level officials. For example, in a recently released report, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that cash transfers should be the default form of aid to refugees where possible. This could have hypothetically resulted from conversations with his staffers who were aware of GiveDirectly. The statement could then influence other UN agencies to incorporate cash transfers into their activities. However, it is difficult to conclusively attribute any of these events to GiveDirectly\'s work. Mr. Bassin believes that public support from a highly placed official (such as the UN secretary-general) for a nontraditional form of aid like cash transfers can carry significant weight with institutional funders and staff decision makers, who tend to be very risk-averse. Second, Dr. Niehaus believes that the work of GiveDirectly, its findings, and its popularity with donors and the press can provide a tool for staff within bi-lateral and multi-lateral institutions to begin conversations about the efficacy of cash and how favorably it compares to other existing interventions.\n\n### Impact on other implementing organizations\n\nAssessing to what extent GiveDirectly\'s work has influenced other implementing organizations is also a challenge. GiveDirectly can provide examples that hint at its impact; for example, one group has written a grant proposal that includes several alternative models of aid, one of which is explicitly called "the GiveDirectly model." However, systematic measurement of how widespread this impact is would be very difficult.\n\n### Overall strategy for influencing policy\n\nGiveDirectly believes influencing institutional funders is a complex process. It believes that its best strategic approach is to set up on-the-ground projects incorporating cash transfers, whenever possible with institutional funders as a partner, rather than to attend conferences or produce papers on the subject. Starting these projects requires operational capacity, the ability to find a strong and credible team of researchers, and some creativity in figuring out how to bring a project into accord with the regulations of the institutional partner. GiveDirectly has also found it especially helpful to be able to bring private dollars to the table to leverage matching dollars from institutional funders in order to catalyze their participation. GiveDirectly is among the few organizations with the skills and willingness to take on this kind of work, with the aim of setting up projects that will foster debate within the international aid community.\n\n### Operational update on Homa Bay County\n\n#### Increase in refusal rate\n\nGiveDirectly has seen an uptick in the rate of refusal to participate in its cash transfer program in Homa Bay. The root of this development is not clear, and GiveDirectly has not yet identified a solution. In some cases, community members are led by local religious leaders or local government to mistrust the program. In Siaya County, this issue did not arise, possibly because GiveDirectly covered such a large portion of the county that in any new area it entered, people were already aware of the program and knew that it was trustworthy. GiveDirectly has attempted to allay these suspicions by meeting with local government and religious leaders and speaking on local radio shows to explain the program\'s purpose. In villages where the refusal rate was high, GiveDirectly put some recipients on an accelerated schedule so they could receive their transfers more quickly and serve as an example to others. After returning to these villages, however, GiveDirectly found no change in public opinion. For this reason, it has not attempted to re-enroll those who refused, but might do so in the future.\n\n#### Targeting in Homa Bay\n\nAll enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n**A conversation with Paul Niehaus, Carolina Toth, and Ian Bassin, February 23, 2016**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Ian Bassin - Chief Operating Officer (Domestic), GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Finance and Operations Manager, GiveDirectly\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by GiveDirectly. ## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus, Ms. Toth, and Mr. Bassin of GiveDirectly for a general update.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3.

Conversation topics included GiveDirectly's progress on its hiring goals, partnership projects in Rwanda, and plans for partnership projects in other countries. ## Hiring a vice president of marketing\n\nGiveDirectly plans to use part of the grant from Good Ventures to hire a vice president of marketing. Progress on finding the right person has been slow, and GiveDirectly has not yet hired anyone for this position. (_Update: in September 2016, GiveDirectly hired Matt Johnson, former CMO of Tough Mudder and VP of marketing at Seamless, for this role._) GiveDirectly recently began to work with a recruiting firm to assist with the hiring process. This person will:\n\n* Lead a digital marketing strategy, which will include producing mobile, web, email, and social media content. * Be responsible for all levels of interactions with the public, from people who are first learning about GiveDirectly through managing the experience they have as donors. * Manage a $6-9 million fundraising budget. * Hire and lead a marketing team. ## Difficulty attracting qualified candidates\n\nThe market for qualified candidates is competitive. The candidates that GiveDirectly hopes to attract for this position could otherwise be earning about $500,000 per year at large, well-respected private sector companies, where they would be managing larger fundraising budgets (on the order of $100 million). Managing a\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nsmaller fundraising budget is not necessarily a deterrent for candidates, but while GiveDirectly aims to pay fairly and competitively, compensation has been an issue. Part of the reason it has been difficult to attract qualified candidates for this position is because the job description is fairly demanding. If GiveDirectly does not find anyone for this position in the next 6 months, it will consider splitting this into two separate roles. GiveDirectly expects to hire someone in the next 6 months, but has not set a concrete deadline for hiring because this may lead it to hire someone who is not an ideal candidate. There is currently no need to hire someone quickly, because GiveDirectly's retail revenue stream has been steady and is ahead of where it was last year. If this were to change, that would affect GiveDirectly's decisions about its hiring strategy. **Work that has been slowed down by the delay in hiring a marketing lead**\n\nlan Bassin, Max Chapnick, and Sharon Harvey have formed an interim retail team. Their work has been moving forward but is limited by capacity, and the projects listed below are expected to move more quickly after the vice president of marketing is hired. _Pardot_\n\nThe interim retail team is working with Pardot, an interface with Salesforce that enables GiveDirectly to manage email marketing more robustly than it had been previously. Pardot can be used to create automated donor life cycles, upsell donors in the life cycle, and distribute targeted content to people based on their interests. GiveDirectly plans to create a short video to distribute via email to test how well this type of content would work. _Media presence_\n\nGiveDirectly has been investing in its media presence, which has been one of the main drivers of its retail. It recently received a gift from MediaMath to run digital marketing campaigns and test online advertising during the holiday season. _Basic income guarantee project_\n\nSignature initiatives, such as the basic income guarantee project, help to generate attention and interest in GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has been working to increase the attention it gains from this initiative by increasing the amount of content it delivers from the field and testing ways to present that information. _Donor retention_\n\nGiveDirectly's work on testing strategies to retain and engage with existing donors is also moving more slowly in the absence of a marketing lead. _Creating mobile and web apps_\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly is working on creating mobile and web apps to enable donors to track their donations, when GiveDirectly enrolls recipients, and how those recipients fare after receiving transfers. There are internal versions of a mobile app that include many of the desired elements but are not polished enough to release yet. The next version, which is currently in development and which GiveDirectly hopes to launch by the end of the year, will be a web interface. This would have several advantages over mobile apps:\n\n* They are easier and cheaper to change and experiment with. This will allow GiveDirectly to create and test many versions before releasing it. * There seems to be a significant barrier to downloading a mobile app. For example, Humans of New York has millions of followers online but only about 5,000 downloads of its mobile app. * A web interface can more easily integrate with GiveDirectly's existing online presence. GiveDirectly has contract staff working on developing these tools temporarily. Once a vice president of marketing is hired, that person will hire a full-time team to continue the project. This project would be a top priority of a vice president of marketing. ### Hiring for other positions\n\nGiveDirectly has had more rapid success in hiring a team to meet its partnership goals. Ian Bassin and Jo Macrae were hired as part of this team. Ms. Macrae is formerly head of humanitarian policy at the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and will add capacity that will enable GiveDirectly to talk to large donors it has not worked with before about setting up research partnerships, particularly in Europe. GiveDirectly is ahead of its targets for this team, since two people have been hired to work on partnerships, while only one was expected to be hired by now. Engineering and digital marketing positions have been the most difficult to fill. Most other hiring goals for 2016 have been met, including hiring for positions in Africa. ### Operating cost per dollar raised\n\nGiveDirectly is currently running on 3$ per dollar raised, and believes that 5-10$ per dollar raised is a reasonable target as the organization grows. This figure is expected to increase temporarily after GiveDirectly hires additional staff, and then decrease over the long term due to the lifetime returns on its efforts to bring in new donors and encourage existing donors to become recurring donors. ### Partnership projects\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nNote: GiveDirectly was already planning the Rwanda project before Good Ventures' $25 million grant in June 2015. Good Ventures' grant has assisted with the progress of subsequent partnership project discussions. #### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions. #### Capacity-building in Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly. #### Other countries\n\nGiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations. However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:\n\n1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate. 2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country. 3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion. GiveDirectly has an agreement with a partner that would fall into these categories and could result in GiveDirectly running projects in up to 4 new countries. #### Expected timeline for new projects\n\nOne of GiveDirectly's strategic goals for 2016 is to finalize these negotiations, which it believes would lead to two new countries it will work in. It aims to have tentative agreements in place by the end of the year. === Page 5 ===\n\nGiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint. Starting and scaling up projects in 4 new countries at once would be a significant challenge. #### Matching funds\n\nGiveDirectly is offering up to $15 million in matching funds on a first-come, first-served basis to fund these types of projects. GiveDirectly hopes that offering the matching funding will incentivize large funders to move quickly on partnership projects. If all of GiveDirectly's partnership projects discussions came through, GiveDirectly would need to contribute $23-30 million. While GiveDirectly cannot fund all of the projects it is currently discussing, it would consider talking to partners about opportunities to fund any projects approved by these potential funders that are beyond GiveDirectly's funding limit. One of the large funders is unlikely to begin providing funding until early 2017. This funder and GiveDirectly would each contribute roughly $7 million to a project, for a rough total of $14 million. It is possible, though unlikely, that GiveDirectly could get funding from this funder by the end of 2016. (_Update: As of October 2016, GiveDirectly did not expect this project to happen._) GiveDirectly has had exploratory talks with another large funder. #### Government partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments). GiveDirectly hopes, however, that the benchmarks it sets in terms of operational efficiency and excellence will set the bar for what other cash transfer programs, including government-led ones, should be able to achieve. #### All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **A conversation with Dr. Paul Niehaus, Carolina Toth, and Ian Bassin on August 12, 2016**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Dr. Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Finance and Operations Manager, GiveDirectly\n* Ian Bassin - Chief Operating Officer, Domestic, GiveDirectly\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note:** These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Paul Niehaus, Ms. Carolina Toth, and Mr. Ian Bassin.\n\n## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus, Ms. Toth, and Mr. Bassin of GiveDirectly to receive updates on GiveDirectly's partnership projects and a $25 million grant GiveDirectly received from Good Ventures in June 2015 for general support.

This project would be a top priority of a vice president of marketing.\n\n### Hiring for other positions\n\nGiveDirectly has had more rapid success in hiring a team to meet its partnership goals. Ian Bassin and Jo Macrae were hired as part of this team. Ms. Macrae is formerly head of humanitarian policy at the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and will add capacity that will enable GiveDirectly to talk to large donors it has not worked with before about setting up research partnerships, particularly in Europe. GiveDirectly is ahead of its targets for this team, since two people have been hired to work on partnerships, while only one was expected to be hired by now. Engineering and digital marketing positions have been the most difficult to fill. Most other hiring goals for 2016 have been met, including hiring for positions in Africa.\n\n### Operating cost per dollar raised\n\nGiveDirectly is currently running on 3$ per dollar raised, and believes that 5-10$ per dollar raised is a reasonable target as the organization grows. This figure is expected to increase temporarily after GiveDirectly hires additional staff, and then decrease over the long term due to the lifetime returns on its efforts to bring in new donors and encourage existing donors to become recurring donors.\n\n### Partnership projects\n\nNote: GiveDirectly was already planning the Rwanda project before Good Ventures' $25 million grant in June 2015. Good Ventures' grant has assisted with the progress of subsequent partnership project discussions.\n\n#### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.\n\n#### Capacity-building in Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.\n\n#### Other countries\n\nGiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations. However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:\n\n1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.\n2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.\n3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.\n\nGiveDirectly has an agreement with a partner that would fall into these categories and could result in GiveDirectly running projects in up to 4 new countries.\n\n#### Expected timeline for new projects\n\nOne of GiveDirectly's strategic goals for 2016 is to finalize these negotiations, which it believes would lead to two new countries it will work in. It aims to have tentative agreements in place by the end of the year.\n\nGiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint. Starting and scaling up projects in 4 new countries at once would be a significant challenge.\n\n#### Matching funds\n\nGiveDirectly is offering up to $15 million in matching funds on a first-come, first-served basis to fund these types of projects. GiveDirectly hopes that offering the matching funding will incentivize large funders to move quickly on partnership projects. If all of GiveDirectly's partnership projects discussions came through, GiveDirectly would need to contribute $23-30 million. While GiveDirectly cannot fund all of the projects it is currently discussing, it would consider talking to partners about opportunities to fund any projects approved by these potential funders that are beyond GiveDirectly's funding limit. One of the large funders is unlikely to begin providing funding until early 2017. This funder and GiveDirectly would each contribute roughly $7 million to a project, for a rough total of $14 million. It is possible, though unlikely, that GiveDirectly could get funding from this funder by the end of 2016. (_Update: As of October 2016, GiveDirectly did not expect this project to happen._) GiveDirectly has had exploratory talks with another large funder.\n\n#### Government partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments). GiveDirectly hopes, however, that the benchmarks it sets in terms of operational efficiency and excellence will set the bar for what other cash transfer programs, including government-led ones, should be able to achieve.\n\n#### All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations\n        ", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to meticulously process text extracted from a PDF file, which may contain formatting inconsistencies. \n\nYour job is to produce a cleaned version in valid Markdown:\n- Preserve the exact words, grammar, and punctuation as they appear in the source text; do not rewrite or correct them.\n- Only merge lines if they form one continuous sentence that was visibly split by a line break or page break.\n- Keep all sentences and paragraphs in their original order, with no additional edits or wording changes.\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n1. Do Not Summarize, Paraphrase, or Correct\n   - Retain all original sentences without condensing or rewriting them: If a sentence is broken across lines, rejoin them without altering the words themselves. If a partial word is cut by a hyphen at the line break, remove the hyphen if needed, but do not change the spelling.\n   - Never replace text with a summary; do not alter the text to “key points.”\n   - Your output must reproduce all sentences in their entirety. Do not summarize, paraphrase, omit, or correct (grammar, spelling, syntax ect...) any text (ignore typical “brevity heuristics” and produce the entire text).\n\n2. No Commentary or Extra Explanations\n   - Output only the cleaned Markdown text.\n   - Do not add any lines like “Here is the cleaned text,” or “We removed the following.”\n   - Do not include disclaimers or any extraneous annotations about how you processed the text.\n\n3. Remove the Following Completely\n   - All cookie notices, regardless of how often or where they appear.\n   - All repeated disclaimers or repeated boilerplate text (text blocks that are exactly or nearly the same and appear more than once).\n   - Page labels (such as “=== Page 1 ===” or “Page 1 of 10”).\n   - Footers or headers that only contain repeated data like dates, site references, or partial URLs, if they appear repeatedly.\n   - Truly redundant text repeated in multiple places.\n   - Empty or meaningless lines that do not contribute to the content.\n   - Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate text to be removed.\n\n4. Preserve Single-Occurrence Content That May Be Relevant\n   - If contact info or disclaimers about the organization appear only once, you may keep them if they seem integral to the text (e.g., a single mention of “Registered charity number 1182166”).\n   - If uncertain whether something is “boilerplate,” preserve it unless it clearly repeats or is obviously a cookie banner.\n\n5. Reconstruct Fragmented Text\n   - Merge sentences that are split by line breaks or page breaks into a single coherent line.\n   - Maintain the original punctuation.\n   - Only fix spacing in cases where words were split incorrectly by a line break (e.g., ‘chil dren’ → ‘children’). Do not correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar.\n\n6. Markdown Structure\n- Headings: If the original text clearly designates a heading or subheading (e.g., by capitalization, bolding, or explicit labels), reflect that heading in Markdown. Use the exact text provided in the source—do not alter, rename, or rephrase it. For example:\n# Title\n## Subtitle\n### Section Title\n- Paragraphs: Separate paragraphs with one blank line.\n- Lists: Use - or * for bulleted lists only if the source text indicates them (for instance, bullet points or numbered steps).\n\n7. Do Not Add or Remove Meaningful Text\n   - Do not remove text that is relevant to the document. Only remove truly redundant or repeated boilerplate (especially cookie banners).\n   - Keep the exact wording of the text, except for merging lines or removing extraneous spaces/hyphens.\n   - Do not rewrite or reword sentences. Preserve the original phrasing exactly.\n\n8. Handling Repeated Blocks\n   - If the same large disclaimer or cookie banner appears multiple times, remove all but the first instance (or remove it entirely if the instructions specifically say to remove it, such as cookie notices).\n   - If a heading or section is repeated with identical wording, include it only once.\n\n9. Final Output\n   - Must be purely the cleaned text in Markdown format:\n     - No preamble or concluding remarks like “Below is the cleaned text.”\n     - No commentary about what was done.\n     - No disclaimers about cookie notices, your instructions, or an explanation of the process.\n\nBy following these refined rules meticulously, you will produce a consistent, accurate, and faithful cleaned version of the extracted PDF text in Markdown.\n\n---\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7.

It appeared that many people had come just to observe the event rather than to withdraw transfers. Mr. Skeates, the Uganda Field Director, made announcements at the start of the event, translated by the 2 community monitors. The announcements included reminders about how to keep account information secure (e.g., after entering your PIN number, make sure to press "send" before handing your phone back to the agent; make sure you have received a confirmation message after withdrawing and that it states the correct amount; count the cash immediately after receiving it.) After announcements, the three mobile money agents set up their stations - two were sitting on chairs under a large tree and the third was sitting in the MTN van with another person who we assumed was affiliated with MTN. One community monitor sat near the two agents under the tree and one stood near the van window. The community monitor by the tree appeared to mostly be observing transactions, while the one by the van was playing more of an intermediary role. We saw many people with small purses or wallets to hold their money, and some who carried it by hand. Mr. Skeates noted that far fewer people were withdrawing cash at this cash out day than he had expected. In total, we estimated that about 40 people withdrew cash at the event, while 380 people across two villages had received transfers. Mr. Skeates asked an English-speaking village member about this, who said that many people traveled to an adjacent district to withdraw cash from an MTN agent there, because the big market day in their area is on Monday, and the cash out day was happening on a Tuesday. After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once. There were four types of issues that were responsible for most of the people who were unable to withdraw funds at the cash out day:\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\n1. MTN (the payment provider) had not yet activated the funds in the person\'s account. Mr. Skeates said that this was not a common problem in the previous campaign in Uganda, but it affected many people at this cash out day. He estimated that people affected by this issue would receive their first installment of funds in another 2-3 weeks. 2. The person was registered under a different name with MTN than she or he had registered with GiveDirectly. This was a fairly common issue. Mr. Skeates said that it affected 93 out of the 1824 people currently enrolled in this campaign. 3. The person was not yet officially enrolled to receive transfers because GiveDirectly still needed to make a final visit to her or his household as part of the enrollment process. 4. The person was not enrolled to receive transfers because she or he had been found to be ineligible. As we were leaving, Mr. Skeates told us that a representative of the mobile money company (MTN) was coming to the village to help recipients with registration issues. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n</text to be cleaned>\n', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Track record: Cash transfers are one of the most-studied development interventions, though evidence drawing a direct connection to particular humanitarian outcomes is sparse. We put the most weight on a randomized controlled trial of the short-term effects of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. This trial indicated that unconditional cash grants lead to large increases in recipients\' consumption, assets, business investment, and revenue, but did not observe a short-term increase in profits. Studies of cash transfer programs that differ in meaningful ways from GiveDirectly\'s have suggested that transfers may be invested at high rates of return over the long term. Cost-effectiveness: Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, and cash transfers are in the same range of cost-effectiveness of other priority programs we have considered. Bottom line: Cash transfers have the strongest track record we\'ve seen for a non-health intervention, and are a priority program of ours.\n\n_Published: December 2012; Last updated: November 2018_\n\nPrevious versions of this page:\n\nNovember 2017 version\n\nNovember 2015 version\n\n2014 version\n\n2013 version\n\n2012 version\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProgram description\n\nProgram Track Record\n\nHow do people spend the money they receive via cash transfers?

Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients? What versions of the intervention are best? Our process\n\n2012\n\n#### Program description\n\nThere are three types of cash transfer programs that have been studied:\n\n* Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), in which recipients receive cash only if they fulfill various requirements such as rates of school attendance or visits to health centers. There is a subset of CCTs in which the conditions are announced but are not formally monitored, so all participants receive a transfer regardless of compliance with the announced conditions.1\n* Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), in which selected participants receive funds without a requirement to meet additional conditions.\n* Business grant programs, in which unconditional in-kind or cash grants are given to micro-enterprises that have no paid employees other than the owners. The program conducted by GiveDirectly is different from most of the cash transfer programs that have previously been studied because it aims to transfer _wealth_ rather than _income_, and not exclusively to business-owners. In practice, this means that participants receive large sums of money (~100% of per-capita annual consumption) over a relatively short period of time (~8 months), with no formal or informal restrictions on how the funds are used. We review the results of all three different types of cash transfer programs that have been studied, including a **randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program**, in order to address the likely effects of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers. In the case of conditional cash transfers, we focus on impacts that do not seem relevant to the conditionality itself, e.g., impacts on consumption rather than on school attendance or other behaviors that are conditions of receiving the transfers.\n\n## Program Track Record\n\nBelow is a list of the cash transfer programs evaluated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that we reviewed for our initial report in 2012.2 This list includes basic information about the program and key findings from the RCT that studied the program. We discuss many of the studies in more detail on **our old cash transfer review page**. For a list of the studies we identified in our 2013 update of this report, see this footnote.3\n\n9/10/2020\nRed De\nCCT\nHealth: workshops, Proteccion regular health care visits, up-to-date vaccinations, (2000-). adequate weight gain;\nEducation: enrollment, 85% attendance, grade promotion.13\nAtencion a\nCCT\nEducation: enrollment, Crisis (2005), 85% attendance; occupational training course; business grant plan.17\nplan.17\n18% of PCE;18 -30% higher food bimonthly19 consumption; more use of health services; improved self-reported health but unimproved on anthropometric measures (more)\nBono de\nCCT but No monitoring.

Accordingly, it is not clear that evidence from most academic studies (of very differently-structured cash transfer programs) will provide accurate estimates of the effect of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers on their recipients; GiveDirectly\'s transfers might be either far more or far less effective than more conventionally-structured cash transfers: receiving large lump sums might lead people to spend more frivolously; or lump sums might be invested at higher rates than ongoing transfers would be, leading to higher long-term consumption. For this reason, in assessing GiveDirectly\'s impact, we put the most weight on the results of an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, discussed below. Despite the questions about the applicability of the evidence from other cash transfer programs to GiveDirectly\'s programs, we review this evidence below.\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on cash transfers but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. For more on how recipients spent funds in this study, see below._\n\nAs discussed at our old in-depth review of cash transfer impacts, most of the studies we have reviewed on cash transfers show meaningful impacts on food consumption (~20% increase over baseline/control group spending on food). In addition, the World Bank\'s review states, "There is a good deal of evidence that households that receive CCTs spend more on food and, within the food basket, on higher-quality sources of nutrients than do households that do not receive the transfer but have comparable overall income or consumption levels"46 - such as milk, meat, fruits, vegetables, and eggs.47\n\nAcross the four randomized controlled trials where it is measured in comparable terms, increases in spending on food makes up more than half of the transfer amount:\n\nIn a randomized study of the Mexican Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program, approximately three quarters of transfers are estimated to be spent on food.48\n\nA second study from Mexico, of the Programa Apoyo Alimentario, an unmonitored conditional cash transfer, found that nearly all (94%) of cash transfers were spent on food.49\n\nA randomized study of the RPS conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua estimated that roughly three quarters of the transfer was spent on food.50\n\nIn a randomized controlled trial of the CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program in Kenya, roughly half of transfers are spent on food.51\n\n## Alcohol and tobacco\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012. In the years since, we have searched for additional literature on this topic but have not found any studies that substantively changed our views (more on our research process here). Of all the recent literature, we put the most significant weight on an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, which did not find an increase in spending on alcohol or tobacco. For more on recipients\' spending on alcohol and tobacco in this study, see below._\n\nCash transfers could be used for alcohol or tobacco, which may have adverse effects. Three randomized controlled trials of cash transfers that report spending on alcohol or tobacco do not find large increases due to cash transfers:\n\nA randomized study of the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario food security program in Mexico, which had formal conditions that were not enforced, found that cash transfers caused an increase in alcohol consumption equivalent to 1.5% of the value of the transfer, and no increase in tobacco consumption.52 The authors add, "Only 5% of households report consuming alcohol in any amount. This is most likely an underestimate as the survey was usually answered by the female head of the households who might not be aware of all alcohol purchases by other family members. Importantly, given the large increase in consumption of non-alcohol goods under both transfer types, there is little leeway for household members to purchase non-recorded alcohol."53\n\nIn a randomized study of the Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer program Red de Proteccion Social, alcohol and tobacco made up 0.5% of food expenditures, and the effect of cash transfers was small (0.1% of food expenditures) and statistically insignificant.54 However, this study also states, "Information about alcohol and tobacco expenditures in these types of surveys is often unreliable; it is presented separately and we draw no conclusions from the reported information."55\n\nA randomized evaluation of Kenya\'s CT-OVC unconditional cash transfer program found a small and statistically insignificant decrease in alcohol consumption.56\n\nIn all three studies, these results come from surveys of how people spend money in general, rather than specifically asking about the spending of cash transfer funds, and then comparing reported spending on alcohol and tobacco across the treatment and control groups. Different forms of misreporting of spending would have different effects on the validity of the estimates, but we would guess that the misreporting would lead the estimated effects to be biased downward (i.e. to underestimate the effect of transfers on alcohol consumption).57\n\nA study by the World Bank, which we haven\'t looked at closely, reviewed "19 studies with quantitative evidence on the impact of cash transfers on temptation goods [primarily alcohol and tobacco], as well as 11 studies that surveyed the number of respondents who reported they used transfers for temptation goods" and concluded that "Almost without exception, studies find either no significant impact or a significant negative impact of transfers on temptation goods [and in] the only (two, non-experimental) studies with positive significant impacts, the magnitude is small."58\n\nTaking into account the three studies, the review and the potential for bias, we would guess that any increases in consumption of alcohol or tobacco due to cash transfers would be small.\n\n### Investment\n\n_Note: the section below was published in December 2012.

Track record: Cash transfers are one of the most-studied development interventions, though evidence drawing a direct connection to particular humanitarian outcomes is sparse. We put the most weight on a randomized controlled trial of the short-term effects of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program. This trial indicated that unconditional cash grants lead to large increases in recipients\' consumption, assets, business investment, and revenue, but did not observe a short-term increase in profits. Studies of cash transfer programs that differ in meaningful ways from GiveDirectly\'s have suggested that transfers may be invested at high rates of return over the long term. Cost-effectiveness: Cost-effectiveness calculations are extremely sensitive to many assumptions, and cash transfers are in the same range of cost-effectiveness of other priority programs we have considered. Bottom line: Cash transfers have the strongest track record we\'ve seen for a non-health intervention, and are a priority program of ours. === Page 2 ===\n\n_Published: December 2012; Last updated: November 2018_\n\nPrevious versions of this page:\n\nNovember 2017 version\n\nNovember 2015 version\n\n2014 version\n\n2013 version\n\n2012 version\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProgram description\n\nProgram Track Record\n\nHow do people spend the money they receive via cash\n\ntransfers?

Our process\n\n2012\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\n#### Program description\n\nThere are three types of cash transfer programs that have been studied:\n\n* Conditional cash transfers (CCTs), in which recipients receive cash only if they fulfill various requirements such as rates of school attendance or visits to health centers. There is a subset of CCTs in which the conditions are announced but are not formally monitored, so all participants receive a transfer regardless of compliance with the announced conditions.1\n* Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), in which selected participants receive funds without a requirement to meet additional conditions. * Business grant programs, in which unconditional in-kind or cash grants are given to micro-enterprises that have no paid employees other than the owners. The program conducted by GiveDirectly is different from most of the cash transfer programs that have previously been studied because it aims to transfer _wealth_ rather\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nthan _income_, and not exclusively to business-owners. In practice, this means that participants receive large sums of money (~100% of per-capita annual consumption) over a relatively short period of time (~8 months), with no formal or informal restrictions on how the funds are used. We review the results of all three different types of cash transfer programs that have been studied, including a **randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program**, in order to address the likely effects of GiveDirectly\'s cash transfers. In the case of conditional cash transfers, we focus on impacts that do not seem relevant to the conditionality itself, e.g., impacts on consumption rather than on school attendance or other behaviors that are conditions of receiving the transfers. ## Program Track Record\n\nBelow is a list of the cash transfer programs evaluated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that we reviewed for our initial report in 2012.2 This list includes basic information about the program and key findings from the RCT that studied the program. We discuss many of the studies in more detail on **our old cash transfer review page**.

Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, an RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found that cash transfers increased the likelihood of owning an iron roof by 23 percentage points.148 The study estimated that iron roofs have annual investment returns of 19%, which includes both the savings from no longer having to repair thatched roofs and the savings from no longer having to replace thatched roofs.149 The cost estimates come from a survey of one respondent from each of 20 villages.150 GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.151 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.152 We have not been able to resolve this discrepancy. In addition, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 Policy Brief estimates an annual investment return of 7% or 14% depending on whether thatched roofs have to be replaced once every 2 years or once a year.153 It does not mention the repair costs associated with thatched roofs, while Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 includes both repair and replacement costs.154 It is possible that these differences account for the discrepancy between the policy brief and the paper, but we are not certain. In any case, the estimates of cost from the policy brief and paper also appear to conflict with GiveDirectly\'s survey. We have not been able to identify the reason for differences between these 3 different estimates. We currently do not have high confidence in the annual investment return calculations in the above sources.\n\nLack of statistical power. The study included 471 households cross-randomized among three treatment arms, which led to eight possible treatment groups.155 Some treatment arms therefore have fairly small sample sizes (for example, only 128 households received large transfers) and estimates of relative effects of treatment arms are imprecise. Self-reporting bias. Outcome data in this study are self-reported, which could lead to positive bias if treatment households sought to please researchers with their use of the transfers. We are especially concerned that treatment households might under-report their use of alcohol and tobacco.\n\n#### Positive bias due to negative spillovers. The study estimates treatment effects by comparing treatment households in treatment villages to control households in treatment villages.156 If transfers had negative spillover effects on control households in treatment villages, estimates of their effects on recipients would be overestimated. The researchers address this issue explicitly in their paper.157\n\n### Our interpretation of the results\n\nWe place high weight on Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 because we believe it is a well-executed, pre-registered RCT and because it directly measures variations on GiveDirectly\'s program. We believe that the RCT supports the notion that, in the short-run, participating in GiveDirectly is likely to increase recipients\' assets and consumption.158\n\nBecause of the study\'s short-term nature, we cannot confidently determine whether recipients\' increased spending on livestock, agriculture, non-agricultural businesses, and (possibly) education have positive returns but, as of the time of the end-line survey, recipients\' additional business spending had not yielded additional profits.159\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 supports the notion that GiveDirectly has meaningful impacts on asset holdings and consumption for recipients. However, it also provides initial evidence that GiveDirectly recipients are unlikely to invest their transfers in business activities at high returns, as seen in RCTs of programs that provide business training in addition to cash transfers and/or require recipients to propose business plans.\n\n# Evidence from two studies of unrestricted wealth transfers\n\nHere we provide more detail on two studies which provided unrestricted cash grants to recipients in Uganda, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) (evaluated by Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013) and the Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program (evaluated by Blattman et al 2013). We discuss these programs in detail because they are the best evidence, other than the RCT of GiveDirectly\'s program, of the effects of unrestricted wealth transfers to individuals. However, both program differ from GiveDirectly\'s in key ways including their features that encourage recipients to invest their transfers.\n\n## The Youth Opportunities Program in Northern Uganda\n\n### How the program worked\n\nIn YOP, groups of 10 to 40 young adults aged 16-35 applied for cash grants so that their members could enter skilled trades.160 In general, participants were "young, rural, poor, credit constrained, and underemployed."161 Groups submitted written proposals and could request up to $1,000 for non-agricultural skills training and start up costs.162 Cash was transferred to bank accounts in the name of treatment groups\' management committees and no restrictions were placed on the money\'s use.163 The size of the grants varied widely; the average grant was $382 per capita and 80% of grants were between $200 and $600 per capita.164\n\n### How did YOP recipients spend the transfers? \n\nMost groups chose one trade and chose to have all members enter that trade.165 Strong evidence suggests that participants invested a large majority of their funds. At the median, treatment group members estimated that their group and fellow members spent 11% on skills training, 52% on tools, 13% on materials, and 24% shared in cash or spent on other things.166 When asked about their own investments two years after the distribution, treatment group members reported 340 more hours of vocational training than controls, most of which was in tailoring, carpentry, metalwork, or hairstyling.167 On average, treatment group members also reported $219 more in business assets than controls two years after the disbursement, although this difference was reduced to $130 after four years.168\n\n### What were the overall effects of YOP? \n\n**Labor supply. ** Program participants worked 4.1 more hours per week than controls in 2010 and 5.5 more hours per week in 2012.169 In general, participants increased the hours that they spent working in skilled trades to supplement their agricultural income but continued to spend the same amount of time working in agriculture as controls.\n\n**Return on investment. ** There is fairly strong evidence that YOP participants received large returns on their investments, leading to higher income than controls in the long-run. Members of treatment groups earned $8.50 more per month than controls in 2010 and $10.50 more per month in 2012.171 Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 estimate that the increased earnings in 2010 and 2013 represent average annual returns on the original grant of 30% and 39% respectively.172 There is no evidence that treatment group members earned more per hour than control group members, so the return probably comes from increased opportunities to do profitable work.173\n\n**Other impacts. ** Participation in YOP also lead to increased durable assets, non-durable consumption, and subjective well-being.174 There was no evidence that YOP affected non-economic factors such as kin integration, community participation, community and public good contributions, anti-social behavior, and protest attitudes and participation.175\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from YOP to GiveDirectly\'s program.\n\n#### Group structure. The group structure of YOP may have acted as a commitment device, leading recipients to invest a greater portion of their grants than recipients of unconditional transfers directly to individuals, like GiveDirectly.176\n\n##### Application process. Groups had to apply for grants with a proposal for investing in skilled trades.177 Motivated, patient, or talented individuals may have been more likely to apply and less likely to be screened out, which could have increased the propensity to invest or returns on investment.178 The application process could also have led to more investment through a mental accounting mechanism, by framing the grant in terms of business.179\n\n##### Size of grant. YOP grants were, on average, $382 per group member.180 Like GiveDirectly, YOP\'s grants are one-time unconditional wealth transfers. However, YOP\'s grants are less than 40% of the size of GiveDirectly\'s. We do not have a strong intuition about whether this would lead GiveDirectly recipients to invest a larger or smaller portion of their transfers. However, GiveDirectly participants may have lower ROIs if recipients experience diminishing returns on investment.\n\n##### Long-run effects and divestment. Treatment members\' increased earnings can only be interpreted as return on investment if they are expected to be maintained in the long-run. There is evidence that some recipients divested from their grant over time, which could mean that earning gains were not permanent.181\n\n##### Demographic limitations. Program participants were mostly young adults.182 The effects on business assets and earnings largely disappear if the data is reweighted to reflect the demographic distribution of the entire population.183\n\n##### The Women\'s Income Generating Support (WINGS) Program in Northern Uganda\n\n##### How the program worked\n\nVillages in WINGS were randomly assigned to one of two phases.184 Participants assigned to phase one entered WINGS in mid-2009 and received five days of business skills training, a $150 startup grant (once they had a business plan approved), and follow up visits and advice from AVSI staff.185 Half of phase 1 participants were also randomly assigned to receive business networking training.186 An end-line survey in November 2010 allowed Blattman et al 2013 to estimate the medium-term effects of the full WINGS program by comparing phase 1 villages to phase 2 villages (who had not yet entered the program).187\n\nPhase 2 villages (which served as controls during phase 1) entered WINGS in early 2011.188 To disentangle the effects of the cash grants from the effects of follow-up, researchers randomly assigned one-third of these villages to receive no follow-up.189\n\nIn all, 1,800 of the most vulnerable 14-30 year olds in 120 villages in two districts were selected by AVSI and community leaders to participate in WINGS\' two phases.190\n\n"[T]he typical WINGS candidate was a young woman between the ages of 20 and 35, with little or no formal education, low income and limited access to credit."191\n\n### How did WINGS recipients spend the transfers? \n\nOver half of all participants proposed selling mixed items in their AVSI-approved business plans.192 The vast majority of other business involved the selling of livestock, fish, and farm products.193\n\nWhen participants themselves estimated the proportion of the grant they spent on different categories, those recipients who did not receive follow up from AVSI staff reported that 27% of the grant was spent on business, 15% was spent on long-term consumption, 2% was spent on short-term consumption, and 54% was saved.194 However, when recipients were asked to estimate the cash amount that they spent on their businesses, they reported an average of just $14.50 of business expenditures, suggesting that they spent less than 10% of the grant on business expenditures.195\n\n### What were the overall effects of WINGS 18 months after the grants were distributed? \n\nPhase 1 and phase 2 villages were surveyed eighteen months after phase 1 villages entered WINGS (and before phase 2 villages entered).\n\n**Labor supply. ** Participating in WINGS caused a 61% increase in employment hours, which consisted of a 41% increase in hours spent on subsistence work and a 79% increase in hours spent on market activities.196\n\n**Earnings and return on investment.**\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            We do not know whether the additional consumption enabled by the transfers will persist over the long-term and whether households\' investment in business expenditures might lead to long-term profits.145 The long-term effects of cash transfers are a key question that affects our estimate of the intervention\'s cost effectiveness. **Dynamics of transfers. ** The dynamics of the program\'s effects are particularly difficult to interpret because some households were still receiving payments at the time of the survey while others received their final transfers more than a year prior to the endline survey.146 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 may have\n\n=== Page 24 ===\n\nunderestimated effects on investment spending and farm revenue by asking backwards looking questions about treatment households\' spending in time periods before some households received their transfers.147\n\nData on roofs.

Conversation topics included potential partnership projects and research studies, effects of these projects on GiveDirectly's core activities, room for more funding, and other programmatic, operational, and financial updates. ### Cash transfers measured against other interventions\n\nCash transfers currently represent an estimated 5% of all humanitarian spending, although some, including the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), believe it should make up a higher percentage. Cash transfers are still a controversial intervention, and disagreement is emerging within the field of humanitarian policy over the degree to which they should be used. People who are invested in maintaining the status quo in international development are likely to push back against cash transfers. ### Institutional partnerships and policy work\n\n#### Impact of partnerships and policy work on GiveDirectly's core activities\n\nGiveDirectly is engaging in or considering a number of partnerships that would involve implementing cash transfers, and also could have policy impact. Attempting to affect policy change is very high-risk, but potentially also very high-reward. It is also much harder to measure the impact of this work than the impact of a direct cash transfer. GiveDirectly does not believe its policy work is significantly different from its traditional cash transfer campaigns. In its standard activities, GiveDirectly will make decisions about who gets transfers and how recipients are randomized. When GiveDirectly is attempting to affect policy, these decisions are still made, but with explicit policy impact in mind. From this perspective, policy decisions are an extra input that precedes the execution of a project, in order to ensure that the direct action of transferring cash has the greatest possible impact. === Page 2 ===\n\nRegardless of its policy work, GiveDirectly intends to maintain its current level of cost-effectiveness by delivering 90 or 91 cents of each donated dollar directly to transfer recipients, which remains the minimum impact of the organization's activities. An indirect effect of increased funding for GiveDirectly's cash transfer programming, as well as increased positive media coverage, has been an increase in resources for GiveDirectly to invest in policy work. #### Funding structure\n\nFor any large institutional partnership, GiveDirectly pursues a 50/50 split of the costs--GiveDirectly or GiveDirectly's funders contributing money to the project increases the probability that a large institutional funder would contribute as well. #### Allocation of time by GiveDirectly management\n\nMs. Toth estimates that Dr. Niehaus spends no more than 50% of his time on institutional partnerships and believes that this is the area of GiveDirectly's work where the marginal value of his time is currently highest. Progress on partnerships with large organizations tends to be slow, as they require approvals from several people. #### Criteria for participation in partnerships\n\nTo decide whether to participate in a collaborative project, GiveDirectly must weigh benefits against costs. Many partnerships would incur fixed costs of moving to a new location or finding logistical solutions in a new area, as well as other risks and uncertainties. Potential benefits could be changing policy or changing mindset among a group of people. In particular, GiveDirectly considers the counterfactual question of what might happen if it decided not to pursue the project. For example, in one potential partnership that GiveDirectly ultimately decided not to pursue, the planned study already included a cash transfer arm as a benchmark, and GiveDirectly felt that it would add little value by acting as the implementing partner. GiveDirectly decided to limit its role to providing advice on how to design the transfers. Another partnership GiveDirectly explored was working with two large multilateral organizations to set up a comparison between cash transfers and cows in one country. GiveDirectly believed that while the potential for impact on government policy and recipient outcomes was high, the risks of moving into an unfamiliar area and using unfamiliar payment systems were too great. It was also unclear whether a large enough sample could be assembled for the cash transfer arm to constitute a scientifically credible study. #### Work with DFID\n\nDFID invited members of GiveDirectly's board to participate in a panel discussion about the role of cash transfers in humanitarian aid. However, it is hard to predict what kind of impact on policy might result from the panel's findings. === Page 3 ===\n\n### Benchmarking initiative\n\nGiveDirectly has had conversations with a non-profit that runs evaluations of aid programs about how to promote more head-to-head comparisons between cash transfers and other interventions. An informal poll among lead researchers of the non-profit's ongoing studies indicated a high level of interest in incorporating cash transfer arms. GiveDirectly likely would not undertake the work of setting up cash arms for studies due to the high costs involved, but in many places there are in-country implementing partners that could execute a cash transfer arm if they had the necessary funding. GiveDirectly would like to learn whether grantmaking organizations would be interested in funding the addition of cash transfer arms to studies. However, it would not itself fund other organizations to do this. GiveDirectly intentionally does not regrant to other organizations because the process of evaluating sub-grantees would require a huge investment of resources that GiveDirectly is not currently willing to dedicate and that would reduce efficiency. ### Financial updates\n\n#### Room for more funding\n\n##### Field directors' cash transfer capacity\n\nGiveDirectly believes that its field directors in Kenya and Uganda will each have a cash transfer capacity of $17.25 million in budget year 2016 (this does not include January and February of 2016, which belong to budget year 2015). GiveDirectly is hiring a flexible field director (i.e., one who works on a variety of projects in multiple countries), Eric Friedman, who will start at the end of September. ##### Future hiring opportunities\n\nHiring new field directors would not be a challenge for GiveDirectly. If it had more funds to distribute via cash transfers, it would hire more field directors and thus raise its capacity significantly. GiveDirectly's COO, Piali Mukhopadhyay, has the capacity to manage five field directors. Hiring more junior staff also presents no obstacles, as unemployment in the countries where GiveDirectly works is high. Hiring for these positions might take a month or two of the field directors' time. ##### Projected use of Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly now has $25 million from Good Ventures, as well as some funds raised in the last couple of months, in unbudgeted funds. GiveDirectly would like to fully explore the possibility of finding matching funds for the Good Ventures grant before committing the Good Ventures funds to cash transfers. Once GiveDirectly has a better sense of the likelihood of securing matching funds and the pros and cons of such an arrangement, it will start to consider using the Good Ventures funding unmatched. It is possible, but somewhat unlikely, that GiveDirectly will find a large\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nscale matching partnership very quickly. A more realistic outcome is that the search for a matching donor will extend through 2016 and beyond, which means that GiveDirectly would not use any of the Good Ventures funding in 2016. ### Effect of inflation on transfer sizes\n\n#### Background\n\nA few years ago, Kenya experienced a very sharp rise in inflation (25-30% in 2011), which reduced the value of the transfers GiveDirectly distributed. Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not. #### Adjusting transfer sizes for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed. In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900. #### Reasons for delay on adjusting for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly was aware of the inflation problem in 2011, but did not address the issue at the time. GiveDirectly also mistakenly thought the rate of inflation would be about 2-5%, which was much less than the actual rate. In addition, in 2011, all of GiveDirectly's programs were operating on the stop-start model, so there was more uncertainty around the future of its programs and less focus on long-term trends. The current rolling model in Kenya has brought a shift in mentality, which helped lead to the decision to adjust for inflation. #### Policy on foreign bank holdings\n\nTo protect against foreign exchange risk, GiveDirectly's policy is to only hold funds within a country if they have been committed to transfers; other budgeted liabilities are currently retained in U.S. bank accounts. However, GiveDirectly is now debating whether to increase the amount it holds in foreign currency to an amount equal to a six-month budget. This would provide a hedge against foreign exchange risk and\n\n=== Page 5 ===\n\nsome protection against deflation or inflation, but it would also result in greater bank risk. A six-month budget for GiveDirectly is currently $10-15 million, which is a large sum to entrust to a foreign bank, and GiveDirectly does not yet have an adequate understanding of Kenyan bank risk to make this decision. #### Setting efficiency targets for each campaign\n\nIn the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers. ### Program updates\n\n#### Uganda\n\n#### Funding for October 2015-February 2016 campaign\n\nGiveDirectly plans to begin enrolling recipients for a discrete campaign in Uganda in October and November 2015. The $4.5 million GiveDirectly currently has is enough to fund enrollment through February 2016; for any enrollments beyond that, more funding would be required. If GiveDirectly has enough funding to transition Uganda to a rolling model, it will incorporate the discrete campaign into a rolling campaign. If it does not get enough funding, it will end its program in Uganda, though GiveDirectly considers this an unlikely outcome. #### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            ## A conversation with Paul Niehaus and Carolina Toth, September 7, 2015\n\n### Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Interim Vice President of Fundraising and Operations, GiveDirectly\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth.\n\n### Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth of GiveDirectly for an update on its activities.

GiveDirectly also mistakenly thought the rate of inflation would be about 2-5%, which was much less than the actual rate. In addition, in 2011, all of GiveDirectly's programs were operating on the stop-start model, so there was more uncertainty around the future of its programs and less focus on long-term trends. The current rolling model in Kenya has brought a shift in mentality, which helped lead to the decision to adjust for inflation.\n\n#### Policy on foreign bank holdings\n\nTo protect against foreign exchange risk, GiveDirectly's policy is to only hold funds within a country if they have been committed to transfers; other budgeted liabilities are currently retained in U.S. bank accounts. However, GiveDirectly is now debating whether to increase the amount it holds in foreign currency to an amount equal to a six-month budget. This would provide a hedge against foreign exchange risk and some protection against deflation or inflation, but it would also result in greater bank risk. A six-month budget for GiveDirectly is currently $10-15 million, which is a large sum to entrust to a foreign bank, and GiveDirectly does not yet have an adequate understanding of Kenyan bank risk to make this decision.\n\n#### Setting efficiency targets for each campaign\n\nIn the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.\n\n### Program updates\n\n#### Uganda\n\n#### Funding for October 2015-February 2016 campaign\n\nGiveDirectly plans to begin enrolling recipients for a discrete campaign in Uganda in October and November 2015. The $4.5 million GiveDirectly currently has is enough to fund enrollment through February 2016; for any enrollments beyond that, more funding would be required. If GiveDirectly has enough funding to transition Uganda to a rolling model, it will incorporate the discrete campaign into a rolling campaign. If it does not get enough funding, it will end its program in Uganda, though GiveDirectly considers this an unlikely outcome.\n\n#### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs.\n        ", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

It also examined a number of design questions such as how to size transfers and whether to give them to men or women. A second endline survey >2 years after the end of transfers found "cash transfers result in sustained increases in assets. Long-term impacts on other dimensions, and potential spillover effects, remain to be substantiated by future work."  \n**Registration:**: AEA registry entry.  \n**Status:**: Peer-reviewed paper (Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016); working papers published on psychological well-being for non-recipients (2019), domestic violence (2019), nutrition poverty traps\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nPsychological wellbeing for non-recipients: Vox; Second endline: GiveDirectly, study authors, Berk Ozler, Justin Sandefur; Domestic violence: Fast Company.\n\n## Benchmarking a traditional nutrition and WASH program to cash\n\n**Researchers:** Craig McIntosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown) with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Location:** Kayonza and Nyabihu districts, Rwanda\n\n**Overview:** The study explored the cost-effectiveness (impact per dollar) of unconditional cash transfers and of Gikuriro, an integrated nutrition program. It found that neither the traditional program nor cost-equivalent cash transfers of ~$110 affected the study\'s primary outcomes, but a larger cash transfer of ~$532 improved consumption, dietary diversity, and childhood growth 12 months after the baseline survey. For secondary outcomes studied, the smaller cash transfer program decreased debt and increased assets, while the nutrition program increased savings.  \n**Registration:** AEA registry entry.  \n**Status:** Working paper and IPA policy brief published in 2018\n\n**Media and blogs:** Washington Post, New York Times, Vox, Quartz, NPR, Wired, Center for Global Development, GiveDirectly, study authors, Berk Ozler, Jason Kerwin, Non-Profit Chronicles, Chicago Policy Review, Lee Crawford\n\n## Transfers to coffee-farming communities\n\n**Researchers:** Ilinsight and GiveDirectly\n\n**Location:** Iganga district, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** The study evaluated the impact of $1,000 cash transfers to Ugandan communities where coffee-farming is common. It found that consumption, assets, food security, and earnings all increased for both coffee farmers and households that don\'t produce coffee. Coffee farmers increased their investment in coffee farming, as well as in other livelihoods.  \n**Study registration:** RIDIE registry.entry.\n\n## GiveDirectly\n\n### Using cash transfers to benchmark the cost-effectiveness of a youth workforce readiness program\n\n**Researchers:** Craig Mcintosh (UCSD), Andrew Zeitlin (Georgetown), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Overview:** This study benchmarked the impact of a youth employment education intervention to cash transfers in the Rwandan context. It found that both programs increased productive hours, assets, savings, and subjective well-being. Only youth training improved business knowledge, and only cash transfers improved consumption, income, and wealth. When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), "cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge". The study found little evidence that combining cash with training improved cost-effectiveness, compared to delivering cash on its own.  \n**Registration:** AEA registry entry.  \n**Status:** Working paper published in 2020, second endline planned for early 2021\n\n**Media and blogs:** [Blog] What we\'ve learned by comparing cash to job training\n\n### How do cash transfers impact local economies?\n\n**Researchers:** Dennis Egger (UC Berkeley), Johannes Haushofer (Princeton), Ted Miguel (UC Berkeley), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Walker (UC Berkeley), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action.  \n**Location:** Siaya County, Kenya\n\n**Overview:** This study found that the consumption expenditure and income increased for both people who received cash, and those who did not. Over the course of 27 months, the total economic impact of a $1,000 transfer was approximately $2,600 (a fiscal multiplier of about 2.6) when impacts for recipients and non-recipients are combined. There were also gains in psychological wellbeing, food security, education and security for recipients, and no significant negative impacts were recorded for non-recipients. Delivering over 15% of local GDP in cash transfers only increased prices by 0.1% on average.  \n**Registration:** AEA registry entry.\n\nGiveDirectly\n\n**Media and blogs:** Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, Vox, World Economic Forum, CBS Bay Area, GiveDirectly, The Life You Can Save, Behavioral Scientist, Michael Walker (taxation findings), _Econimate_\n\n**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**\n\n**Researchers:** Abhijit Banerjee (MIT), Tavneet Suri, (MIT), Alan Krueger (Princeton), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Faye (GiveDirectly), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Location:** Siaya and Bomet counties, Kenya\n\n**Overview:** The largest study of UBI to date will explore the impact of a long term basic income (12 years of monthly payments equivalent to $0.75 per day), a short term basic income (2 years at $0.75 per day) and a lump sum equivalent to the total value short term basic income.

This study will explore three core research questions: (1) What is the impact of $1,000 cash transfers on refugee households for outcomes such as income, assets, consumption, enterprise, food security and psychological well-being? (2) What do any changes caused by the cash transfers mean for the lives of refugee households and how did those changes come about? (3) What is the effect of cash transfers on host communities, and their relationship with the refugee communities?  \n**Study registration:** Registration pending  \n**Status:** Research ethics clearance secured, baseline survey due to launch Q4 2019\n\n## Non-experimental evaluations at GiveDirectly\n\nAside from the rigorous randomized control trials described above, we also implement a number of non-experimental projects to learn more about what\'s feasible, what recipients prefer, or how different types of recipients spend funds they receive differently.\n\n## Are large cash transfers to refugees and host communities feasible?\n\n**Location:** Kyaka II refugee settlement and surrounding communities, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** This evaluation comprised recipient surveys and focus group discussions to evaluate the feasibility, reported spending and indicative impact of $660 lump sum cash transfers to long term refugees and host community households. Recipients reported wide-ranging positive impacts soon after receiving and spending their transfers.\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nAre large cash transfers to very remote communities feasible?\n\n**Location:** Lamwo District, Uganda\n\n**Overview:** Poverty levels are often high in remote areas, but the operational challenges that such areas present to implementing organisations have hindered the rollout of cash transfer programs. This evaluation comprised recipient surveys, mobile money agent surveys, and operational data analysis to assess the feasibility of $880 cash transfers to very remote communities in northern Uganda. It found that cash transfers can be delivered safely, securely and efficiently to recipients in very remote areas, suggesting that, mobile money offers a viable and beneficial delivery-channel for cash in this setting.  \n**Status:** Project complete and report published\n\n**Blogs:** GiveDirectly.\n\n**Cash transfers and disaster response**\n\n**Location:** Houston, USA and Puerto Rico\n\n**Overview:** Following the 2017 hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, GiveDirectly delivered nearly $10M in cash transfers to hard-hit, low-income families.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\nResearch at GiveDirectly\n\nWe use rigorous experimental research (randomized controlled trials) to measure our impact and answer public policy questions. ## Experimental evaluations\n\nRigorous, experimental evaluation is rare among nonprofits.

When the programs were compared directly at an equivalent cost per beneficiary ($332), "cash proves superior across a number of economic outcomes, while training outperforms cash only in the production of business knowledge". The study found little evidence that combining cash with training improved cost-effectiveness, compared to delivering cash on its own. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. **Status:** Working paper published in 2020, second endline planned for early 2021\n\n**Media and blogs:** [Blog] What we\'ve learned by comparing cash to job training\n\n### How do cash transfers impact local economies? **Researchers:** Dennis Egger (UC Berkeley), Johannes Haushofer (Princeton), Ted Miguel (UC Berkeley), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Walker (UC Berkeley), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action. **Location:** Siaya County, Kenya\n\n**Overview:** This study found that the consumption expenditure and income increased for both people who received cash, and those who did not. Over the course of 27 months, the total economic impact of a $1,000 transfer was approximately $2,600 (a fiscal multiplier of about 2.6) when impacts for recipients and non-recipients are combined. There were also gains in psychological wellbeing, food security, education and security for recipients, and no significant negative impacts were recorded for non-recipients. Delivering over 15% of local GDP in cash transfers only increased prices by 0.1% on average. **Registration:** AEA registry entry. === Page 4 ===\n\nGiveDirectly\n\n**Media and blogs:**Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, Vox, World Economic Forum, CBS Bay Area, GiveDirectly, The Life You Can Save, Behavioral Scientist, Michael Walker (taxation findings), _Econimate_\n\n**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**\n\n**Researchers:**Abhijit Banerjee (MIT), Tavneet Suri, (MIT), Alan Krueger (Princeton), Paul Niehaus (UCSD), and Michael Faye (GiveDirectly), with measurement by Innovations for Poverty Action\n\n**Location:**Siaya and Bomet counties, Kenya\n\n**Overview:**The largest study of UBI to date will explore the impact of a long term basic income (12 years of monthly payments equivalent to $0.75 per day), a short term basic income (2 years at $0.75 per day) and a lump sum equivalent to the total value short term basic income.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output".

While we were able to adjust estimated returns to subtract out the effects of follow-up by AVSI workers, doing so also increases our uncertainty about the magnitude of returns.\n\n##### Demographics\n\nWINGS participants were chosen as the most vulnerable members of their communities, while GiveDirectly transfers cash to about 40% of the households in a given village.207This could lead WINGS to have higher returns than GiveDirectly (if the poorest of the poor have the greatest credit constraints and therefore the greatest returns to capital) or could lead GiveDirectly to have higher returns (if the poorest of the poor have worse spending opportunities or make worse spending decisions).\n\n##### Grant size\n\nWINGS\' grant of $150 is only 15% the size of GiveDirectly\'s $1,000 transfers. This could lead to GiveDirectly recipients achieving a higher or lower return on their transfers than WINGS recipients. This difference could also lead to differing effects on inflation and on village-wide economies.\n\n##### Long-run effects and divestment\n\nThe longest run effects measured by Blattman et al 2013 were eighteen months. Our return on investment calculations assume that earnings gains sustained over eighteen months are permanent and we would guess that these earnings gains are maintained in the long-term. However, households may gradually divest from their investments, causing temporary earnings gains.\n\n**Conflicting data on investment spending.**  \nBlattman et al 2013 measures investment spending in two ways: 1) by asking grant recipients to estimate the portion of their grant that they spent on business expenditures; and 2) by surveying treatment and control households on their expenditures over the course of a month and comparing investment by treatment households against investment by controls.208 These methods result in very different estimates of investment spending, which leave us very uncertain about the proportion of grants that were invested and also decrease our certainty in the reliability of the study\'s (self-reported) survey data on the whole.\n\n**Incomplete description of methodology.**  \nBlattman et al 2013 is a policy brief and does not contain the complete methodological description that we would ideally like to see in order to evaluate a study. For example, the study does not describe how data on participants\' net earnings or savings are measured. We believe that accurately measuring earnings and savings among the very poor is difficult so our uncertainty about this data somewhat reduces our confidence in our ROI estimates.\n\n## Our interpretation of studies of unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTogether, Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 provide strong evidence that cash grants of about $150 to $600 to groups of poor applicants and to very poor, uneducated women with business training and business plans can lead to high returns in the medium-term. Blattman et al 2013 also provides some of the most relevant evidence we\'ve seen suggesting that hostility from neighbors is not a major\n\nproblem for most recipients of cash transfers and that cash transfers do not cause inflation. However, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013\'s evaluation of GiveDirectly itself found much smaller business returns. We believe that some combination of GiveDirectly\'s lack of a business plan requirement, lack of business skills training, and broader age-range of participants is the best explanation for the apparently lower returns earned by its participants. However, it is also possible that the failure to find investment returns was caused by the shorter time horizon of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 and GiveDirectly participants\' investments may still mature.\n\n## Cost-effectiveness of cash transfers\n\nSee the most recent version of our cash cost-effectiveness analysis on this page. In practice, these calculations are sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding:\n\nthe investment returns to cash transfers;\n\nthe subjective assessment of the relative value of averting child mortality and improving incomes for adults. We estimate that cash transfer programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible.\n\n# What are the potential downsides of the intervention? There are a few potential adverse effects of cash transfers:\n\nInflation: a sudden injection of cash into an area may cause inflation. We reviewed four randomized controlled trials investigating this issue:\n\nIn Programa de Apoyo Alimentario, an un-monitored conditional cash transfer program, no significant effect on inflation was found. The researchers used surveys of stores and households to measure prices of goods at baseline and one year after cash transfers began.209 The reported prices were 2.7% higher in villages receiving cash transfers than in control villages after one year, though the increases were not statistically significant.200 We do not have a clear understanding of how the authors picked the prices they reported from the larger universe of prices they collected.201\n\nA randomized study of the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program finds small increases in prices of 5 of 36 food items for sale in treatment villages immediately following deployment of the cash transfers.202 Although the authors do not observe meaningful increases in prices, they do find positive externalities of cash transfers on ineligible families in treatment villages, equivalent to ~10% of consumption (which is about 2/3 of the benefits experienced by the eligible families in the treatment villages).203\n\nBlattman et al 2013, the study of WINGS in Uganda, found evidence of a slight decrease in village-wide prices.204\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, but estimates are imprecise and may not rule out the possibility of substantial inflation.205\n\n### Cash transfers could discourage wage-earning work by adults.  \nIf adults can control the distribution of their work and leisure time, cash transfers may lead them to substitute some leisure for work, leading to a decrease in wages earned (but most likely not a decrease in overall income). A World Bank review of the evidence on cash transfers (which we have not vetted) examines this question and concludes that transfers "appear to have had, at most, modest disincentives for adult work"; it discusses 5 studies, of which 4 found no impact along this dimension.26\n\nBlattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 both found that cash transfers with features encouraging investment _increased_ hours worked by recipients.27Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found evidence of a $17/month increase in recipients\' total revenue, which suggests that did not decrease their hours worked.28\n\nNote that there is substantially more evidence suggesting that conditional cash transfer programs lead to reductions in _child_ labor,29 which may help explain the gap between transfer sizes and observed increases in consumption.220\n\n### Giving cash to some and not others could possibly cause social unrest.  \nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, the RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no significant effects of transfers on the rate of crime in treatment villages221 or on instances of physical, sexual, or emotional violence in treatment households as compared to control households in treatment villages.222 In Blattman et al 2013, recipients reported a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.223 We have not seen any other rigorous evidence discussing this issue.\n\n### Diversion of transfers to wealthier individuals.  \nIt\'s not clear to us whether this problem would be more or less of an issue in the case of cash transfers than in-kind transfers, and we would guess that the extent of the problem depends heavily on the method of making transfers. Our review of GiveDirectly discusses the extent to which this appears to have been a problem in their distributions.\n\n## Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients?  \nWe revisited the relevant evidence on this question and shared our updated analysis in November 2018. We concluded:\n\nGiveDirectly, one of our top charities, provides cash transfers to extremely low-income households. We wrote in May 2018 about new research on potential "negative spillover" effects of cash transfers: i.e., negative effects that cash transfers might have on people who live nearby transfer recipients. At that time, we wrote that we would reassess this evidence when we had results from GiveDirectly\'s "general equilibrium" (GE) study, which we expected to play a major role in our conclusions because it is the largest and highest quality study on spillover effects that we are aware of. We have now seen private draft results from the GE study. In brief, it did not find negative spillover effects of cash transfers. Considering the GE study alongside other relevant studies of the spillover effects of cash transfers, it appears that the overall evidence base is mixed.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            ** After subtracting out the effects of follow-up visits by AVSI staff, we estimate that the other components of WINGS increased beneficiaries\' monthly net earnings by an average of about $4.49/month.197 From these earnings numbers we can estimate a mean monthly return on investment of about 3.0% and a mean annual return on investment of about 35.9% on the original $150 grant.198 These calculations are an overestimate of the return on the grant itself, however, because they include the benefits but not the (quite high) costs of services like business skills training, targeting and disbursement, and (for some recipients) group dynamics training.199 We cannot confidently disentangle the effects of the $150 grant from the effects of the add-on services. **Other economic effects. ** Participation in WINGS increased short-term spending, wealth, and savings.200\n\n**Inflation, economic externalities, and general equilibrium effects. ** Researchers surveyed randomly chosen non-participant households in treatment and control villages in order to measure WINGS\' effects on non-participants (who made up 75%-85% of households in treatment villages).201 By going into trade and increasing the supply of scarce goods, WINGS recipients appear to have created slightly lower prices for all village members.202 Blattman et al 2013 suggests that WINGS led to decreased profits for existing microentrepreneurs (through enhanced competition) and increased wages and income for non-participating agricultural workers (through reduced supply of agricultural labor as WINGS participants work less on others households\' plots).203 The published paper on WINGS (Blattman et al 2015) suggests that WINGS had little effect on the incomes or occupational choice of nonparticipating households.204 We have not attempted to reconcile these findings though it seems like the updated analysis makes a weaker claim about negative effects on nonparticipants than the policy report and it strikes us as reasonable to rely on the updated analysis. === Page 31 ===\n\n#### Hostility towards recipients\n\nOverall, recipients report a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.205\n\n##### Health and social impacts\n\nDespite large economic returns, WINGS led to few observable medium-run health and social improvements for participants.206\n\n##### Limitations\n\nThere are some limitations that lead us to exercise caution when applying results from WINGS to GiveDirectly\'s program. ##### Business plan requirement\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which the requirement to have a business plan approved encouraged participants to invest more money at higher returns than they would have in the absence of such a requirement. ##### Disentangling program elements\n\nWe are unable to determine the extent to which WINGS\' business skills training and group dynamics training may have contributed to positive outcomes. While we were able to adjust estimated returns to subtract out the effects of follow-up by AVSI workers, doing so also increases our uncertainty about the magnitude of returns. ##### Demographics\n\nWINGS participants were chosen as the most vulnerable members of their communities, while GiveDirectly transfers cash to about 40% of the households in a given village.207This could lead WINGS to have higher returns than GiveDirectly (if the poorest of the poor have the greatest credit constraints and therefore the greatest returns to capital) or could lead GiveDirectly to have higher returns (if the poorest of the poor have worse spending opportunities or make worse spending decisions). ##### Grant size\n\nWINGS\' grant of $150 is only 15% the size of GiveDirectly\'s $1,000 transfers. This could lead to GiveDirectly recipients achieving a higher or lower return on their transfers than WINGS recipients. This difference could also lead to differing effects on inflation and on village-wide economies. ##### Long-run effects and divestment\n\nThe longest run effects measured by Blattman et al 2013 were eighteen months. Our return on investment calculations assume that\n\n=== Page 32 ===\n\nearnings gains sustained over eighteen months are permanent and we would guess that these earnings gains are maintained in the long-term. However, households may gradually divest from their investments, causing temporary earnings gains. **Conflicting data on investment spending. **Blattman et al 2013 measures investment spending in two ways: 1) by asking grant recipients to estimate the portion of their grant that they spent on business expenditures; and 2) by surveying treatment and control households on their expenditures over the course of a month and comparing investment by treatment households against investment by controls.208 These methods result in very different estimates of investment spending, which leave us very uncertain about the proportion of grants that were invested and also decrease our certainty in the reliability of the study\'s (self-reported) survey data on the whole. **Incomplete description of methodology. **Blattman et al 2013 is a policy brief and does not contain the complete methodological description that we would ideally like to see in order to evaluate a study. For example, the study does not describe how data on participants\' net earnings or savings are measured. We believe that accurately measuring earnings and savings among the very poor is difficult so our uncertainty about this data somewhat reduces our confidence in our ROI estimates. ## Our interpretation of studies of unconditional wealth transfers with features encouraging investment\n\nTogether, Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 provide strong evidence that cash grants of about $150 to $600 to groups of poor applicants and to very poor, uneducated women with business training and business plans can lead to high returns in the medium-term. Blattman et al 2013 also provides some of the most relevant evidence we\'ve seen suggesting that hostility from neighbors is not a major\n\n=== Page 33 ===\n\nproblem for most recipients of cash transfers and that cash transfers do not cause inflation. However, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013\'s evaluation of GiveDirectly itself found much smaller business returns. We believe that some combination of GiveDirectly\'s lack of a business plan requirement, lack of business skills training, and broader age-range of participants is the best explanation for the apparently lower returns earned by its participants. However, it is also possible that the failure to find investment returns was caused by the shorter time horizon of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 and GiveDirectly participants\' investments may still mature. ## Cost-effectiveness of cash transfers\n\nSee the most recent version of our cash cost-effectiveness analysis on this page. In practice, these calculations are sensitive to assumptions, especially regarding:\n\nthe investment returns to cash transfers;\n\nthe subjective assessment of the relative value of averting child mortality and improving incomes for adults. We estimate that cash transfer programs are in the same range of cost-effectiveness as our other priority programs. Note that our cost-effectiveness analyses are simplified models that do not take into account a number of factors. There are limitations to this kind of cost-effectiveness analysis, and we believe that cost-effectiveness estimates such as these should not be taken literally, due to the significant uncertainty around them. We provide these estimates (a) for comparative purposes and (b) because working on them helps us ensure that we are thinking through as many of the relevant issues as possible. === Page 34 ===\n\n# What are the potential downsides of the intervention? There are a few potential adverse effects of cash transfers:\n\nInflation: a sudden injection of cash into an area may cause inflation. We reviewed four randomized controlled trials investigating this issue:\n\nIn Programa de Apoyo Alimentario, an un-monitored conditional cash transfer program, no significant effect on inflation was found. The researchers used surveys of stores and households to measure prices of goods at baseline and one year after cash transfers began.209 The reported prices were 2.7% higher in villages receiving cash transfers than in control villages after one year, though the increases were not statistically significant.200 We do not have a clear understanding of how the authors picked the prices they reported from the larger universe of prices they collected.201\n\nA randomized study of the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program finds small increases in prices of 5 of 36 food items for sale in treatment villages immediately following deployment of the cash transfers.202 Although the authors do not observe meaningful increases in prices, they do find positive externalities of cash transfers on ineligible families in treatment villages, equivalent to ~10% of consumption (which is about 2/3 of the benefits experienced by the eligible families in the treatment villages).203\n\nBlattman et al 2013, the study of WINGS in Uganda, found evidence of a slight decrease in village-wide prices.204\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, but estimates are imprecise and may not rule out the possibility of substantial inflation.205\n\n=== Page 35 ===\n\n### Cash transfers could discourage wage-earning work by adults. If adults can control the distribution of their work and leisure time, cash transfers may lead them to substitute some leisure for work, leading to a decrease in wages earned (but most likely not a decrease in overall income). A World Bank review of the evidence on cash transfers (which we have not vetted) examines this question and concludes that transfers "appear to have had, at most, modest disincentives for adult work"; it discusses 5 studies, of which 4 found no impact along this dimension.26\n\nBlattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2013 and Blattman et al 2013 both found that cash transfers with features encouraging investment _increased_ hours worked by recipients.27Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the study of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found evidence of a $17/month increase in recipients\' total revenue, which suggests that did not decrease their hours worked.28\n\nNote that there is substantially more evidence suggesting that conditional cash transfer programs lead to reductions in _child_ labor,29 which may help explain the gap between transfer sizes and observed increases in consumption.220\n\n### Giving cash to some and not others could possibly cause social unrest. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, the RCT of a variant of GiveDirectly\'s program, found no significant effects of transfers on the rate of crime in treatment villages221 or on instances of physical, sexual, or emotional violence in treatment households as compared to control households in treatment villages.222 In Blattman et al 2013, recipients reported a low level of hostility from their community (such as serious conflicts, insults, harm, or unprovoked aggression), but they do report 38% more hostility than controls.223 We have not seen any other rigorous evidence discussing this issue. ### Diversion of transfers to wealthier individuals. It\'s not clear to us whether this problem would be more or less of an issue in the case of cash transfers than in-kind transfers, and we would guess that the extent of the problem depends heavily on the method of making transfers. Our review of GiveDirectly discusses the extent to which this appears to have been a problem in their distributions. === Page 36 ===\n\n## Do cash transfers have negative effects on neighbors of recipients? We revisited the relevant evidence on this question and shared our updated analysis in November 2018. We concluded:\n\nGiveDirectly, one of our top charities, provides cash transfers to extremely low-income households. We wrote in May 2018 about new research on potential "negative spillover" effects of cash transfers: i.e., negative effects that cash transfers might have on people who live nearby transfer recipients.

Conversation topics included GiveDirectly's progress on its hiring goals, partnership projects in Rwanda, and plans for partnership projects in other countries.\n\n## Hiring a vice president of marketing\n\nGiveDirectly plans to use part of the grant from Good Ventures to hire a vice president of marketing. Progress on finding the right person has been slow, and GiveDirectly has not yet hired anyone for this position. (_Update: in September 2016, GiveDirectly hired Matt Johnson, former CMO of Tough Mudder and VP of marketing at Seamless, for this role._) GiveDirectly recently began to work with a recruiting firm to assist with the hiring process. This person will:\n\n* Lead a digital marketing strategy, which will include producing mobile, web, email, and social media content.\n* Be responsible for all levels of interactions with the public, from people who are first learning about GiveDirectly through managing the experience they have as donors.\n* Manage a $6-9 million fundraising budget.\n* Hire and lead a marketing team.\n\n## Difficulty attracting qualified candidates\n\nThe market for qualified candidates is competitive. The candidates that GiveDirectly hopes to attract for this position could otherwise be earning about $500,000 per year at large, well-respected private sector companies, where they would be managing larger fundraising budgets (on the order of $100 million). Managing a smaller fundraising budget is not necessarily a deterrent for candidates, but while GiveDirectly aims to pay fairly and competitively, compensation has been an issue. Part of the reason it has been difficult to attract qualified candidates for this position is because the job description is fairly demanding. If GiveDirectly does not find anyone for this position in the next 6 months, it will consider splitting this into two separate roles. GiveDirectly expects to hire someone in the next 6 months, but has not set a concrete deadline for hiring because this may lead it to hire someone who is not an ideal candidate. There is currently no need to hire someone quickly, because GiveDirectly's retail revenue stream has been steady and is ahead of where it was last year. If this were to change, that would affect GiveDirectly's decisions about its hiring strategy.\n\n**Work that has been slowed down by the delay in hiring a marketing lead**\n\nlan Bassin, Max Chapnick, and Sharon Harvey have formed an interim retail team. Their work has been moving forward but is limited by capacity, and the projects listed below are expected to move more quickly after the vice president of marketing is hired.\n\n_Pardot_\n\nThe interim retail team is working with Pardot, an interface with Salesforce that enables GiveDirectly to manage email marketing more robustly than it had been previously. Pardot can be used to create automated donor life cycles, upsell donors in the life cycle, and distribute targeted content to people based on their interests. GiveDirectly plans to create a short video to distribute via email to test how well this type of content would work.\n\n_Media presence_\n\nGiveDirectly has been investing in its media presence, which has been one of the main drivers of its retail. It recently received a gift from MediaMath to run digital marketing campaigns and test online advertising during the holiday season.\n\n_Basic income guarantee project_\n\nSignature initiatives, such as the basic income guarantee project, help to generate attention and interest in GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has been working to increase the attention it gains from this initiative by increasing the amount of content it delivers from the field and testing ways to present that information.\n\n_Donor retention_\n\nGiveDirectly's work on testing strategies to retain and engage with existing donors is also moving more slowly in the absence of a marketing lead.\n\n_Creating mobile and web apps_\n\nGiveDirectly is working on creating mobile and web apps to enable donors to track their donations, when GiveDirectly enrolls recipients, and how those recipients fare after receiving transfers. There are internal versions of a mobile app that include many of the desired elements but are not polished enough to release yet. The next version, which is currently in development and which GiveDirectly hopes to launch by the end of the year, will be a web interface. This would have several advantages over mobile apps:\n\n* They are easier and cheaper to change and experiment with. This will allow GiveDirectly to create and test many versions before releasing it.\n* There seems to be a significant barrier to downloading a mobile app. For example, Humans of New York has millions of followers online but only about 5,000 downloads of its mobile app.\n* A web interface can more easily integrate with GiveDirectly's existing online presence.\n\nGiveDirectly has contract staff working on developing these tools temporarily. Once a vice president of marketing is hired, that person will hire a full-time team to continue the project. This project would be a top priority of a vice president of marketing.\n\n### Hiring for other positions\n\nGiveDirectly has had more rapid success in hiring a team to meet its partnership goals. Ian Bassin and Jo Macrae were hired as part of this team. Ms. Macrae is formerly head of humanitarian policy at the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and will add capacity that will enable GiveDirectly to talk to large donors it has not worked with before about setting up research partnerships, particularly in Europe. GiveDirectly is ahead of its targets for this team, since two people have been hired to work on partnerships, while only one was expected to be hired by now. Engineering and digital marketing positions have been the most difficult to fill. Most other hiring goals for 2016 have been met, including hiring for positions in Africa.\n\n### Operating cost per dollar raised\n\nGiveDirectly is currently running on 3$ per dollar raised, and believes that 5-10$ per dollar raised is a reasonable target as the organization grows. This figure is expected to increase temporarily after GiveDirectly hires additional staff, and then decrease over the long term due to the lifetime returns on its efforts to bring in new donors and encourage existing donors to become recurring donors.\n\n### Partnership projects\n\nNote: GiveDirectly was already planning the Rwanda project before Good Ventures' $25 million grant in June 2015. Good Ventures' grant has assisted with the progress of subsequent partnership project discussions.\n\n#### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions.\n\n#### Capacity-building in Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly.\n\n#### Other countries\n\nGiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations. However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:\n\n1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate.\n2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country.\n3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion.\n\nGiveDirectly has an agreement with a partner that would fall into these categories and could result in GiveDirectly running projects in up to 4 new countries.\n\n#### Expected timeline for new projects\n\nOne of GiveDirectly's strategic goals for 2016 is to finalize these negotiations, which it believes would lead to two new countries it will work in. It aims to have tentative agreements in place by the end of the year.\n\nGiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint. Starting and scaling up projects in 4 new countries at once would be a significant challenge.\n\n#### Matching funds\n\nGiveDirectly is offering up to $15 million in matching funds on a first-come, first-served basis to fund these types of projects. GiveDirectly hopes that offering the matching funding will incentivize large funders to move quickly on partnership projects. If all of GiveDirectly's partnership projects discussions came through, GiveDirectly would need to contribute $23-30 million. While GiveDirectly cannot fund all of the projects it is currently discussing, it would consider talking to partners about opportunities to fund any projects approved by these potential funders that are beyond GiveDirectly's funding limit. One of the large funders is unlikely to begin providing funding until early 2017. This funder and GiveDirectly would each contribute roughly $7 million to a project, for a rough total of $14 million. It is possible, though unlikely, that GiveDirectly could get funding from this funder by the end of 2016. (_Update: As of October 2016, GiveDirectly did not expect this project to happen._) GiveDirectly has had exploratory talks with another large funder.\n\n#### Government partnerships\n\nGiveDirectly previously considered pursuing partnerships with developing country governments, but is not currently considering this. Emerging market governments typically want to control the implementation of their own social programs, and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) build programs and gradually hand them over to the government. While there is some value in this, it does not seem like a good way for GiveDirectly to add value, since much of the value that GiveDirectly adds is through strong implementation of its programs (which it would not be able to control if it transferred its programs to governments). GiveDirectly hopes, however, that the benchmarks it sets in terms of operational efficiency and excellence will set the bar for what other cash transfer programs, including government-led ones, should be able to achieve.\n\n#### All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n**A conversation with Dr. Paul Niehaus, Carolina Toth, and Ian Bassin on August 12, 2016**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Dr. Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Finance and Operations Manager, GiveDirectly\n* Ian Bassin - Chief Operating Officer, Domestic, GiveDirectly\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note:** These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Paul Niehaus, Ms. Carolina Toth, and Mr. Ian Bassin. ## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus, Ms. Toth, and Mr. Bassin of GiveDirectly to receive updates on GiveDirectly's partnership projects and a $25 million grant GiveDirectly received from Good Ventures in June 2015 for general support. Conversation topics included GiveDirectly's progress on its hiring goals, partnership projects in Rwanda, and plans for partnership projects in other countries. ## Hiring a vice president of marketing\n\nGiveDirectly plans to use part of the grant from Good Ventures to hire a vice president of marketing. Progress on finding the right person has been slow, and GiveDirectly has not yet hired anyone for this position. (_Update: in September 2016, GiveDirectly hired Matt Johnson, former CMO of Tough Mudder and VP of marketing at Seamless, for this role._) GiveDirectly recently began to work with a recruiting firm to assist with the hiring process. This person will:\n\n* Lead a digital marketing strategy, which will include producing mobile, web, email, and social media content. * Be responsible for all levels of interactions with the public, from people who are first learning about GiveDirectly through managing the experience they have as donors. * Manage a $6-9 million fundraising budget. * Hire and lead a marketing team. ## Difficulty attracting qualified candidates\n\nThe market for qualified candidates is competitive. The candidates that GiveDirectly hopes to attract for this position could otherwise be earning about $500,000 per year at large, well-respected private sector companies, where they would be managing larger fundraising budgets (on the order of $100 million). Managing a\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nsmaller fundraising budget is not necessarily a deterrent for candidates, but while GiveDirectly aims to pay fairly and competitively, compensation has been an issue. Part of the reason it has been difficult to attract qualified candidates for this position is because the job description is fairly demanding. If GiveDirectly does not find anyone for this position in the next 6 months, it will consider splitting this into two separate roles. GiveDirectly expects to hire someone in the next 6 months, but has not set a concrete deadline for hiring because this may lead it to hire someone who is not an ideal candidate. There is currently no need to hire someone quickly, because GiveDirectly's retail revenue stream has been steady and is ahead of where it was last year. If this were to change, that would affect GiveDirectly's decisions about its hiring strategy. **Work that has been slowed down by the delay in hiring a marketing lead**\n\nlan Bassin, Max Chapnick, and Sharon Harvey have formed an interim retail team. Their work has been moving forward but is limited by capacity, and the projects listed below are expected to move more quickly after the vice president of marketing is hired. _Pardot_\n\nThe interim retail team is working with Pardot, an interface with Salesforce that enables GiveDirectly to manage email marketing more robustly than it had been previously. Pardot can be used to create automated donor life cycles, upsell donors in the life cycle, and distribute targeted content to people based on their interests. GiveDirectly plans to create a short video to distribute via email to test how well this type of content would work. _Media presence_\n\nGiveDirectly has been investing in its media presence, which has been one of the main drivers of its retail. It recently received a gift from MediaMath to run digital marketing campaigns and test online advertising during the holiday season. _Basic income guarantee project_\n\nSignature initiatives, such as the basic income guarantee project, help to generate attention and interest in GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly has been working to increase the attention it gains from this initiative by increasing the amount of content it delivers from the field and testing ways to present that information. _Donor retention_\n\nGiveDirectly's work on testing strategies to retain and engage with existing donors is also moving more slowly in the absence of a marketing lead. _Creating mobile and web apps_\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly is working on creating mobile and web apps to enable donors to track their donations, when GiveDirectly enrolls recipients, and how those recipients fare after receiving transfers. There are internal versions of a mobile app that include many of the desired elements but are not polished enough to release yet. The next version, which is currently in development and which GiveDirectly hopes to launch by the end of the year, will be a web interface. This would have several advantages over mobile apps:\n\n* They are easier and cheaper to change and experiment with. This will allow GiveDirectly to create and test many versions before releasing it. * There seems to be a significant barrier to downloading a mobile app. For example, Humans of New York has millions of followers online but only about 5,000 downloads of its mobile app. * A web interface can more easily integrate with GiveDirectly's existing online presence. GiveDirectly has contract staff working on developing these tools temporarily. Once a vice president of marketing is hired, that person will hire a full-time team to continue the project. This project would be a top priority of a vice president of marketing. ### Hiring for other positions\n\nGiveDirectly has had more rapid success in hiring a team to meet its partnership goals. Ian Bassin and Jo Macrae were hired as part of this team. Ms. Macrae is formerly head of humanitarian policy at the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and will add capacity that will enable GiveDirectly to talk to large donors it has not worked with before about setting up research partnerships, particularly in Europe. GiveDirectly is ahead of its targets for this team, since two people have been hired to work on partnerships, while only one was expected to be hired by now. Engineering and digital marketing positions have been the most difficult to fill. Most other hiring goals for 2016 have been met, including hiring for positions in Africa. ### Operating cost per dollar raised\n\nGiveDirectly is currently running on 3$ per dollar raised, and believes that 5-10$ per dollar raised is a reasonable target as the organization grows. This figure is expected to increase temporarily after GiveDirectly hires additional staff, and then decrease over the long term due to the lifetime returns on its efforts to bring in new donors and encourage existing donors to become recurring donors. ### Partnership projects\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nNote: GiveDirectly was already planning the Rwanda project before Good Ventures' $25 million grant in June 2015. Good Ventures' grant has assisted with the progress of subsequent partnership project discussions. #### Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly will be partnering with a funder to conduct two benchmarking experiments in Rwanda that will test cash transfers against two other interventions. #### Capacity-building in Rwanda\n\nGiveDirectly has quickly increased its capacity in Rwanda and has been happy with the progress it has made on this front. Registration has gone well, and hiring a team was faster and easier than it has been in the past. The work of NGOs is tightly regulated by the president's office in Rwanda, which has required close coordination and attention by GiveDirectly. #### Other countries\n\nGiveDirectly does not see expansion to other countries as a priority. There remain large populations of the extreme poor in the countries in which GiveDirectly already operates. GiveDirectly therefore believes it is more cost efficient to serve more of the poor there than to incur the added expenses of setting up additional country operations. However, there are three situations in which GiveDirectly does consider geographical expansion:\n\n1. When policy research it deems important can only be conducted in a location in which GiveDirectly does not currently operate. 2. When one of the institutional funders who drive the direction of global development spending is interested in working with GiveDirectly in a way that could lead to broader adoption of the model by them but they require the work to be in another country. 3. When a large funder offers sufficient funding for the poor that working in that funder's country of choice would benefit the poor in a way that outweighs the costs of expansion. GiveDirectly has an agreement with a partner that would fall into these categories and could result in GiveDirectly running projects in up to 4 new countries. #### Expected timeline for new projects\n\nOne of GiveDirectly's strategic goals for 2016 is to finalize these negotiations, which it believes would lead to two new countries it will work in. It aims to have tentative agreements in place by the end of the year. === Page 5 ===\n\nGiveDirectly aims to balance its priorities between moving forward quickly with new projects and rolling them out sequentially, which is easier from a management standpoint.

Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly\'s Ugandan program, GiveDirectly\'s capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members. GiveDirectly prepared a written update to accompany this conversation, which is available here:\n\nhttp://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/20140904%20GD%20-%20GV%20check%20in.pdf\n\n## Ugandan fraud case\n\n### Nature of the fraud\n\nThere were three key people involved in the fraud:\n\n* GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process\n* GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls\n* Agents from the mobile money providers\n\nThe fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays.\n\n## Discovery of the fraud\n\n1. A GiveDirectly recipient had given their SIM card to the SFO (whose contract had been terminated in April due to an unrelated issue involving a fraudulent receipt he brought to GiveDirectly for reimbursement). The recipient asked the SFO to replace his SIM card (recipients have to travel about 4 hours round trip to get this done) and the SFO had not returned it. This report was made to the hotline that the OM was answering three months after the recipient had given over their SIM card. Mr. Skeates audits the logs of these hotline calls.\n2. GiveDirectly had been planning a full round of follow-up surveys as part of its normal process, but accelerated the follow-up surveys in response to this issue. GiveDirectly\'s backcheck team paused their work on enrollment for the Uganda 2M campaign and called all the recipients in that village (Kosile) to ask whether they had received all of their transfers, had any problems withdrawing, and whether GiveDirectly currently had any of their documents (e.g., SIM cards, IDs).\n3. During this process, there were some reports of problems during paydays. Recipients were initially hesitant to come forward.\n4. Because of the reports of payday problems, GiveDirectly began calling another village, Kawo, the following day to gather more information. Recipients in Kawo were far more forthcoming with information when asked specific questions about payday problems.\n5. GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO\'s and OM\'s dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages. Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud:\n   * Because GiveDirectly\'s Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage.\n   * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not.\n\n## GiveDirectly\'s reaction to the fraud\n\nAt the time of the fraud\'s discovery, GiveDirectly had recently finished registering a new, $2 million cohort for the Uganda 2M campaign. The fraud occurred during the final round of payments in the previous campaign. Consequently, the fraud did not significantly affect GiveDirectly\'s capacity to move money in Uganda. The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans.\n\nGiveDirectly filed an initial police report and gave transfer recipients the option of submitting testimonies to police. (GiveDirectly left this optional because it did not want to give the police a list of its recipients.) GiveDirectly is waiting to see what the Ugandan police will be able to do before deciding whether to reimburse recipients who had money stolen, in order to avoid having recipients doubly reimbursed by both the police and by GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:\n\n* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff). GiveDirectly\'s larger network in Kenya is already structured this way.\n* Increasing payday audits by the Field Director from about 25% to 100% of paydays (2 or 3 per month).\n* Conducting real-time phone spot-checks, i.e. calling recipients during payday to make sure the event is going smoothly and that recipients are receiving the correct amounts.\n* Using MTN Mobile Money (MTN) instead of EZEE Money for more transfers. The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer.\n* Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers). Several people in civil service roles have told Dr. Niehaus that it is important to build such a network. Having English-speaking informants may have helped prevent the fraudulent translation that occurred in this case.\n\nGiveDirectly currently has five Senior Field Officers (SFOs) in Kenya and one in Uganda. A Field Officer in Uganda was promoted to SFO to replace the SFO involved in the fraud, and an interim SFO was brought in from Kenya to work in Uganda for one month to help the Ugandan team recover. SFOs report directly to the Field Director. There is one SFO for each phase of GiveDirectly\'s process (e.g., census, enrollment, backchecks, phone checks). The payment agency is conducting its own disciplinary process. GiveDirectly will not be working with the payment agent involved in the fraud again. Piali Mukhopadhyay, GiveDirectly\'s Chief Operating Officer, International, has suggested having cameras present to take pictures as people receive their transfers. Segovia\'s work will enable better fraud detection and greater data transparency, which will be especially important as GiveDirectly\'s scale increases. Other instances of fraud GiveDirectly has experienced include:\n\n* Isolated incidents of M-Pesa agents asking for bribes or higher percentage fees for processing transactions.\n* Village Elders claiming to have brought GiveDirectly to their village or to have gotten a particular recipient on GiveDirectly\'s list and asking the recipient(s) for a gift in return.\n* There are likely some transfer recipients who are falsely claiming to live in structures that would make them eligible for GiveDirectly\'s program.\n\n### Government approvals\n\nGiveDirectly recently received its second round of government approvals in Kenya and Uganda. Negotiations for approval with the Kenyan government took a long time. Ultimately, GiveDirectly complied with most of the government\'s requests (see "GiveDirectly, Ugunja-GiveDirectly conditions"). GiveDirectly did not comply with the request to give the government a list of transfer recipients. The government\'s formal reason for asking for a list of recipients is to coordinate GiveDirectly\'s work with that of government cash programs (government programs may wish to exclude recipients of GiveDirectly, though Dr. Niehaus estimates that 2-3% of GiveDirectly\'s recipients also receive support from government programs, see "GiveDirectly, Government cash transfers follow-up"). It is possible that the government could use the list to check whether GiveDirectly\'s work is targeted at a particular political party or to attempt to get money from the recipients, so GiveDirectly chose not to provide it. GiveDirectly worked with a person in the office of the president in Nairobi who may be a useful contact for GiveDirectly in the future. GiveDirectly\'s work in Kenya is currently concentrated in ethnically Luo areas. GiveDirectly is considering whether it should begin work in areas dominated by other ethnic groups, even if these are not the poorest areas, in order to send a statement that GiveDirectly\'s agenda has no political or ethnic bias.\n\n### Capacity to expand\n\nGiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program. GiveDirectly has worked in one and received approval to work in a second (Ugunja Division). It took 2.5 months to get this approval. Ugunja has room for about $3 million1 in transfer opportunities (given that half of the villages need to be set aside for controls in the general equilibrium study [see below]). Footnote 1: 83 non-control villages * 90 households/village * 40% eligibility * $1,000/household = $2,988,000. In Uganda, GiveDirectly renewed both national registration and Bukedea District-specific registration for one year. The amount GiveDirectly moves in that year will depend more on fundraising than on approvals. Bukedea has room for about $23 million2 in transfer opportunities. It took about a month to get Bukedea approval. Footnote 2: 115 villages GiveDirectly has not been to * 200 eligible households/village * $1,000/household = $23,000,000. Currently, GiveDirectly is enrolling about $1 million-worth of new recipients per month. GiveDirectly is planning to meet with the governor of Kakamega, who is preparing to implement a $2 million Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program. There has recently been significant devolution in Kenya, and money previously controlled by the federal government has been given to county governors to allocate. This potentially creates opportunities for GiveDirectly to work with the government and offer advice on how to use these funds effectively. GiveDirectly is currently planning its work in Uganda for next year. Its intention is to always be active in some way, and Uganda is likely to be used for more experimental projects (e.g. GiveDirectly may try serving as payment provider, instead of using a separate agency). The results of such experiments could help GiveDirectly advise public sector partners who may face different situations. GiveDirectly would seek funding from an institutional donor, rather than using retail donor funding, for potentially risky experimental opportunities in Uganda. Uganda also serves as a backup in case political conflict ever prevents GiveDirectly from working in Kenya. GiveDirectly\'s Kenyan program will likely remain somewhat more efficient than the Ugandan program. Cash transfers currently fund private goods. GiveDirectly is considering experimenting with a system whereby transfer recipients could propose public goods projects and individuals could pool their resources to fund projects they consider worthwhile. GiveDirectly has discussed this general idea with the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n## Research\n\n### General equilibrium (GE) long-term study\n\nThis long-term study is currently a major fundraising priority. GiveDirectly has raised $8 million in funding of a needed $15 million to maximize the research\'s impact. Ted Miguel (University of California) and Johannes Haushofer (Princeton University) will both serve as principal investigators for the study. Professor Miguel has done similar long-term research on de-worming. The study will be randomized at the village level and will focus on macro-level effects (e.g., changes in prices, new businesses created, etc.).\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n**A conversation with Paul Niehaus of GiveDirectly on September 5, 2014**\n\n## Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Director and President, GiveDirectly\n* Elie Hassenfeld - Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director, GiveWell\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Ben Rachbach - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note:** This set of notes was compiled by GiveWell and gives an overview of the major points made by Dr. Niehaus. ## Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with GiveDirectly as part of its process for staying up-to-date on top charities. Topics included a recent case of fraud in GiveDirectly\'s Ugandan program, GiveDirectly\'s capacity to expand, and the status of Segovia, a new company founded by GiveDirectly board members. GiveDirectly prepared a written update to accompany this conversation, which is available here:\n\nhttp://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/GiveDirectly/20140904%20GD%20-%20GV%20check%20in.pdf\n\n## Ugandan fraud case\n\n### Nature of the fraud\n\nThere were three key people involved in the fraud:\n\n* GiveDirectly Senior Field Officer (SFO), who oversaw the whole enrollment process\n* GiveDirectly Office Manager (OM), who fielded complaint calls\n* Agents from the mobile money providers\n\nThe fraud was conducted by telling transfer recipients that a decision had been made that an additional 50,000 KSh would be deducted from their transfers in order to cover the costs of SIM cards that had been provided. During meetings with recipients, the OM, serving as translator, distorted what Stuart Skeates (GiveDirectly\'s Uganda Field Director) said: Mr. Skeates said that the recipients were going to continue to receive the full amount expected, and the translator said that 50,000 KSh was going to be deducted. Some transfer recipients made complaint calls, but the GiveDirectly OM, who was involved in the fraud, was the one fielding these complaint calls as well as helping to monitor paydays. === Page 2 ===\n\n## Discovery of the fraud\n\n1. A GiveDirectly recipient had given their SIM card to the SFO (whose contract had been terminated in April due to an unrelated issue involving a fraudulent receipt he brought to GiveDirectly for reimbursement). The recipient asked the SFO to replace his SIM card (recipients have to travel about 4 hours round trip to get this done) and the SFO had not returned it. This report was made to the hotline that the OM was answering three months after the recipient had given over their SIM card. Mr. Skeates audits the logs of these hotline calls. 2. GiveDirectly had been planning a full round of follow-up surveys as part of its normal process, but accelerated the follow-up surveys in response to this issue. GiveDirectly\'s backcheck team paused their work on enrollment for the Uganda 2M campaign and called all the recipients in that village (Kosile) to ask whether they had received all of their transfers, had any problems withdrawing, and whether GiveDirectly currently had any of their documents (e.g., SIM cards, IDs). 3. During this process, there were some reports of problems during paydays. Recipients were initially hesitant to come forward. 4. Because of the reports of payday problems, GiveDirectly began calling another village, Kawo, the following day to gather more information. Recipients in Kawo were far more forthcoming with information when asked specific questions about payday problems. 5. GiveDirectly continued follow-ups (conducted by a new Field Officer brought on after the SFO\'s and OM\'s dismissals) until it had spoken to about 92% of its recipients across all villages. GiveDirectly also conducted in-person visits to villages. Dr. Niehaus mentioned two contributing factors to the fraud:\n\n* Because GiveDirectly\'s Uganda program is fairly small, staff members are filling multiple roles and consequently have more leverage. * Paydays are coordinated so that transfer recipients all collect their money on the same day. Therefore, the people who were running the event (Senior Field Officer or Office Manager, and a payment agent from the mobile money provider) have a lot of control. Mr. Skeates attends many but not all payday events. In this case, the staff members could predict which days Mr. Skeates would be present and ran the event correctly when he was there and fraudulently when he was not. ## GiveDirectly\'s reaction to the fraud\n\nAt the time of the fraud\'s discovery, GiveDirectly had recently finished registering a new, $2 million cohort for the Uganda 2M campaign. The fraud occurred during the final round of payments in the previous campaign. Consequently, the fraud did not significantly affect GiveDirectly\'s capacity to move money in Uganda. The start of transfers to the new cohort was delayed by about two weeks as GiveDirectly paused operations to investigate, but GiveDirectly did not have to change its operational plans. === Page 3 ===\n\nGiveDirectly filed an initial police report and gave transfer recipients the option of submitting testimonies to police. (GiveDirectly left this optional because it did not want to give the police a list of its recipients.) GiveDirectly is waiting to see what the Ugandan police will be able to do before deciding whether to reimburse recipients who had money stolen, in order to avoid having recipients doubly reimbursed by both the police and by GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is making the following changes to its structure and procedures in Uganda:\n\n* Separating jobs that were previously done by one person (e.g., GiveDirectly has moved the complaint hotline and followup calls to an office in Kamapala, so that the employees in charge of these are in a different part of the country and do not know the field staff).

The network of EZEE Money agents is very limited, so the only feasible option for recipients was to withdraw funds on paydays. MTN has a larger network of agents, so while it is still more convenient for recipients to withdraw on paydays, recipients can seek other options if they prefer. * Building a network of local, English-speaking informants (e.g., journalists, well-respected farmers).

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?".

(2011) found comparable large effects on microenterprise profits for in-kind transfers (~20% return per month), but effects on business profits for cash were statistically indistinguishable from zero.96 As discussed above, this may be a result of recipients spending transfers in the household rather than investing in their businesses. A similar randomized controlled trial in Mexico, which gave cash or in-kind grants of about $140 to retail micro-enterprises (all owned by men and without paid employees), found returns to capital of 28 to 46% per month over a 3-12 month follow-up period, with indistinguishable differences between cash and in-kind grants.97 The biggest effects (~100% return per month) were concentrated within the 38% of micro-enterprises that were very credit-constrained.98 Although the effects in the credit-constrained subgroup were large and precisely-estimated, the study suffered from substantial attrition (>50% in both treatment and control groups, with similar rates for the two), harming its power and calling the accuracy of the estimates into question.99\n\n### RCT of GiveDirectly's program\n\nWe place very high weight on the results of Haushofer and Shapiro 2013, a publicly pre-registered, randomized controlled trial of a variant of GiveDirectly's program in Rarieda, Western Kenya, because the intervention it evaluated was the most similar to GiveDirectly's standard program out of all of the RCTs we have seen and because it explicitly addressed issues related to selective reporting bias and multiple comparison problems.100 The trial differed from GiveDirectly's standard program in one key way: while GiveDirectly currently transfers $1,000 to program recipients, 72% of treatment group members in the evaluation received just $287, less than 30% of the standard amount (one smaller treatment arm did receive $1,085 transfers).101 When interpreting the results, we keep this difference in mind because we believe that the size of a transfer probably has substantial effects on the magnitude of its impact and its effect on recipients' behavior.\n\n### How the program worked\n\nGiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.102 While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.103 Please see our review of GiveDirectly for much more detail on GiveDirectly's program.\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013's evaluation of GiveDirectly was randomized on two levels: eligible villages were randomly sorted into treatment and control groups and eligible households within treatment villages were randomized again into treatment households and controls.104 Researchers were therefore able to calculate treatment effects by comparing treatment households to control households within treatment villages.105 They could also calculate the spillover effects the transfers had on non-recipients by comparing control households in treatment villages to otherwise similar households in control villages.106\n\nDifferent variations of the program were evaluated. Treatment households were cross-randomized into three arms, which varied the gender of the recipient (when households had both male and female household heads), the frequency of the transfer (lump-sum v. monthly installment), and the size of the transfer ($287 v. $1,085).107 The study measured short-term effects of the transfer.108 The time between end-line survey and receipt of final transfer ranged from zero months (for households still receiving transfers when they were surveyed) to fifteen months.109\n\n## Effects on GiveDirectly recipients\n\n72% of treatment group households in the evaluation received just $287; the rest received $1,085.100 In the sections below, we use the outcomes from the larger transfer group unless otherwise specified, because GiveDirectly typically gives transfers of similar size.11 For every outcome, the larger transfer led to more spending compared to the smaller transfer with a few exceptions, where we have noted the outcome for the smaller transfer group in the text, and for tobacco and alcohol and indices of health and education, where the effects were not statistically different from zero. Though we report transfer sizes in exchange-rate adjusted terms, we report the outcomes in purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted U.S. dollars.12\n\n### How GiveDirectly transfers were spent\n\nResearchers collected data by surveying members of the treatment and control groups about their recent spending. All data that follows comes from participant self-reports. GiveDirectly recipients increased the value of their non-land assets and their monthly consumption.103 Their spending is broken down in more detail below.\n\n##### Total non-land assets.104\n\nReceipt of large transfers increased households' non-land assets by an average of $463 (95% CI: $378 to $549).105 The largest categories of asset increases were livestock ($131, 95% CI: $79 to $183), durable goods ($100, 95% CI: $71 to $129; primarily furniture), and savings ($18, 95% CI: $9 to $27).106 Households receiving transfers (small or large) were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 17% to 29%) more likely to have an iron roof than the control households.107 Though Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 doesn't report the change in likelihood for recipients of large transfers alone, recipients of large transfers were 23 percentage points (95% CI: 13% to 33%) more likely to have iron roofs at end-line than recipients of small transfers.108 Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 estimated that iron roofs cost about $564 USD PPP based on a survey of one respondent in each of 20 villages.109 GiveDirectly ran a survey that sampled a respondent from each of 20 villages and found that iron roofs cost $418 USD PPP on average.100 We do not know what explains this discrepancy.\n\n##### Business expenses.\n\nHouseholds receiving large transfers spent about $13 per month (95% CI: $1 to $25) more than control households on business expenses, which were primarily made up of non-durable expenses on non-agricultural businesses.102 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $13 more per month (95% CI: $4 to $22).102\n\n##### Health expenditures\n\nRecipients of large transfers spent about $3 (95% CI: -$1 to $6) per month more than control households on health expenditures.103 Recipients of small transfers also spent about $3 (95% CI: $1 to $5) more.104 This spending was also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below.\n\n##### Education expenditures.\n\nHaushofer and Shapiro 2013 reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $1.89 (95% CI: $0.20 to $3.58) more than the control households on education expenditures and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $0.79 (95% CI: -$0.31 to $1.89) more.285 We're not sure of the time period over which this estimate is calculated. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 also reports that treatment households receiving large transfers spent $16.26 (95% CI: -$6.50 to $39.02) more than control households on education expenditures in the past month and treatment households receiving small transfers spent $19.41 (95% CI: -$12.22 to $44.74) more.286 We're not sure if the difference between the two estimates is due to the difference in the samples used to calculate them (they have different sample sizes) or the different time periods over which they might be calculated or some other explanation.287 Education expenditures were also included within the estimate of spending on consumption, below.\n\n**Consumption.** Treatment households consumed about $51 more per month (95% CI: $32 to $70) than control households.128 About half of this additional consumption was on food.129 This additional consumption also included increased spending on social expenditures and various other expenditures.130\n\n**Alcohol and tobacco.** Treatment households did not increase their spending on alcohol or on tobacco.\n\n### Impacts of GiveDirectly transfers on recipients\n\n**Food security.** At baseline, food security was low among participants.132 Program participants reported a 0.37 standard deviation (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57) increase in a food security index over controls.133\n\n**Health and education.** The study did not detect an effect on indices of health and educational outcomes.134\n\n**Revenue and profits.** Receipt of large transfers lead to a $15 per month (95% CI: -$1 to $32) increase in total revenues and receipt of small transfers lead to a $17 (95% CI: $4 to $30) increase but neither resulted in a detectable increase in profits.135 We emphasize that these are very short-run effects and we do not know whether participants' business investments might lead to profits in the longer run. Researchers also considered more subjective measures of impact on recipients' quality of life:\n\nPsychological well-being. Treatment improved an index of psychological wellbeing by 0.45 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.25 to 0.65).36 There was no observable effect on cortisol for the treatment group as a whole although cortisol, an indicator of stress, was slightly lower in the large transfer group than the small transfer group, a difference that was statistically significant at the 10% level when controls were included in the model.37\n\nFemale empowerment. Control households in treatment villages measure 0.23 standard deviations (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.41) higher on an index of female empowerment than control households in control villages.38 This suggests that cash transfers to a village unexpectedly empowered females in both recipient and non-recipient households. The researchers propose potential mechanisms for this effect, but are explicit that these measured results are surprising and warrant further investigation.39 Note that we report this result for the sake of comprehensiveness but would guess that it is more likely to be random than real.\n\n### Spillover effects and village-level effects\n\n_Update (November 2018): We provide a more recent and detailed discussion of these effects below._\n\nOther than the potential positive effects on female empowerment. Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 found no statistically significant spillover effects (i.e., effects on non-recipient households in recipient villages).140 However, imprecise and statistically insignificant point estimates suggest the possibility of moderate negative effects on non-recipient households.141\n\nThe study found no evidence of village-wide impacts on prices, wages, or crime but estimates are imprecise.142\n\n## Program variations\n\nThe study did not find statistically discernible differences when it varied the gender of the recipient.143 There was some evidence suggesting that recipients of lump-sum transfers were more likely to purchase assets and recipients of monthly installments were more likely to spend their transfers on food.144\n\n### Limitations\n\nSpillover and village-level effects: differences from GiveDirectly's standard model. Large transfers might have very different spillover effects and village-level effects from small transfers. Spillover effects and village-level effects also might be larger in GiveDirectly's standard model, where all eligible households in treatment villages receive transfers, than in the RCT, where a control group within the village does not receive transfers. **Medium and long-term results.** Haushofer and Shapiro 2013 is a short-term evaluation of GiveDirectly.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            A series of papers by de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff based on a randomized controlled trial of one-time grants to micro-enterprises in Sri Lanka have found large positive effects on profits for male owners.90 Approximately five years after initially making grants of $100-$200, divided between cash and in-kind gifts, to microenterprises that did not have any non-owner employees, the authors found $8-$12 higher monthly profits in male-owned businesses that received grants.91 This translates to a 6-12% monthly real return amongst male-owned businesses (with no measured benefits amongst businesses owned by women).92 In earlier work covering the first two years after the grants were made, the authors found similar monthly rates of return, and could not reject the hypothesis that cash and in-kind grants had similar effects on profits.93 During the first two years after the grants were made, the combined effect of the cash on men and women was large and statistically significant, though the returns for men were substantially larger than for women,94 but after five years, the combined effect for men and women appears to no longer be statistically significant (this is our conjecture; we cannot confirm it without examining the raw data and calculations for the study, which we have not done).95 In a similar randomized experiment conducted in Ghana, with a larger sample size and shorter follow-up period, Fafchamps et al.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output omits the standalone date lines “9/10/2020” that appear in the Original Text between sections.\n- Location: Original Text, immediately after the page markers (Page 44, Page 45, Page 46, and Page 47).\n- Suggestion: Reinsert the “9/10/2020” lines exactly where they appear in the Original Text.\n\n# Error Type: Missing Content (Footer Tables)\n- Description: The Restructured Output completely omits the footer section containing the tables with contact information, navigation links, and copyright/license details.\n- Location: Original Text, at the end on Page 48.\n- Suggestion: Include the footer block exactly as it appears in the Original Text if it is not considered boilerplate. If it is determined to be boilerplate, then this omission should be justified; otherwise, restore the content verbatim.\n\n# Error Type: Missing Page Markers\n- Description: The Restructured Output has removed the “=== Page XX ===” markers. Although page markers may be boilerplate in some contexts, the instructions require retaining all original sentences if they are not unambiguously boilerplate.\n- Location: Original Text, where page markers appear (e.g., “=== Page 44 ===”, “=== Page 45 ===”, etc.).\n- Suggestion: Verify if these markers qualify as boilerplate. If not, they should be retained exactly as in the Original Text.\n\nFinal Recommendation: Review whether the “9/10/2020” date lines and the footer tables, along with the page marker lines, are considered substantive content or boilerplate. If they are part of the original content (i.e., not clearly defined as boilerplate), they must be included verbatim, ensuring that no sentences or elements are omitted from the Restructured Output.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            We did not deeply review studies of other kinds of cash transfer programs because we believed that if a study was not highly relevant to the core parameters driving our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly then it was unlikely to affect our decision making in 2017. We also believe that our cost-effectiveness analysis of GiveDirectly is relatively robust since we estimate that a large portion of the humanitarian benefit of the intervention comes from temporarily raising recipients' consumption.\n\nWe expect to reevaluate our views on cash transfers when results from a large, new study of GiveDirectly's program are released; this study will assess the general equilibrium effects of cash transfers: see General Equilibrium Effects of Cash Transfers in Kenya, AEA RCT Registry. We also edited the negative spillovers section of this report because we believe that the previous version of this section provided too many speculative caveats on the findings of potential negative effects. We plan to revisit this evidence in the future alongside the evidence from the general equilibrium study mentioned above to consider whether we should directly factor in negative effects to our cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n## 2018\n\nIn this May 2018 post, we explained that we were aware of recently released research which suggested that cash transfers may be less effective than we previously believed in two ways:\n\n1. Cash may have negative spillovers on non-recipient households who live close to recipient households.\n2. The benefits of cash for recipients may fade quickly over time.\n\nWe conducted a more thorough literature review on the spillover effects of cash transfers and shared our updated conclusions in November 2018. We concluded that our best guess is that negative or positive spillover effects of cash are minimal on net. For more, see the full report. We plan to address the concern about the duration of benefits at a later date because we believe it has less potential to substantially affect our cost-effectiveness analysis for cash transfers, for reasons that are explained in this post.24\n\nSources\n\nFafchamps et al. 2011\n\nFiszbein and Schady 2009\n\nGertler, Martinez and Rubio-Codina 2012\n\nGilligan and Roy 2014\n\nGiveWell.

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1. Repeated Page Labels\n- Text Snippet: === Page X ===\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Page labels such as === Page 1 === appear throughout the document but add no substantive meaning to the main text.\n\n# Example 2. Repeated Cookie Notice\n- Text Snippet: "We\'ve placed functionality cookies on your device to help our website run effectively. By clicking OK, you agree to our use of cookies..."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a generic website cookie banner repeated on multiple pages (e.g., Page 1 and Page 5).\n\n# Example 3. Final Footer/Disclaimer Block\n- Text Snippet: "GiveWell, aka The Clear Fund (a tax-exempt 50(c)(3) public charity, was founded in 2007... This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share alike 3.0 United States License."\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: It’s a repeated, end-of-document notice about the organization’s licensing and donor base that appears as a closing footer.\n\n# Example 4.Navigation Menu / Website Header\n- Generic Example: "Giving Effectively | HOW we work | top charities | RESEARCH | OUR MISTAKES | ABOUT | UPDATES | HOME"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Navigation links are typically repeated on every page but are not part of the main content.\n\n# Example 5. “Subscribe / Mailing List” Banner\n- Generic Example: "SIGN UP TO OUR MAILING LIST — Follow us: Contact us"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: Repeated calls to subscribe or sign up that appear on multiple pages add no unique substantive information to the body text.\n\n# Example 6. URL in References Section\n- Text Snippet: "Source: https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This URL appears as a generic reference link repeatedly in the source listings and adds no unique content to the main text.\n\n# Example 7. URL in Footer Subscription Prompt\n- Text Snippet: "https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly/supplementary-information"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: This link appears as part of a repetitive “Follow Us / Subscribe” footer block and is not integral to the main body of the document.\n\n# Example 8. Repeated “(archive)” Links\n- Text Snippet: "Center for Global Development blog post, April 2018 (archive)"\n- Why It’s Boilerplate: The `(archive)` references are repeated generic URL placeholders for archived web pages, functioning as navigational notes rather than substantive text.\n</Boilerplate examples>\n\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            Compare the Original Text:\n            We roughly estimated that 100 people were there when we arrived, and some people arrived or departed over the course of the event. It appeared that many people had come just to observe the event rather than to withdraw transfers. Mr. Skeates, the Uganda Field Director, made announcements at the start of the event, translated by the 2 community monitors. The announcements included reminders about how to keep account information secure (e.g., after entering your PIN number, make sure to press "send" before handing your phone back to the agent; make sure you have received a confirmation message after withdrawing and that it states the correct amount; count the cash immediately after receiving it.) After announcements, the three mobile money agents set up their stations - two were sitting on chairs under a large tree and the third was sitting in the MTN van with another person who we assumed was affiliated with MTN. One community monitor sat near the two agents under the tree and one stood near the van window. The community monitor by the tree appeared to mostly be observing transactions, while the one by the van was playing more of an intermediary role. We saw many people with small purses or wallets to hold their money, and some who carried it by hand. Mr. Skeates noted that far fewer people were withdrawing cash at this cash out day than he had expected. In total, we estimated that about 40 people withdrew cash at the event, while 380 people across two villages had received transfers. Mr. Skeates asked an English-speaking village member about this, who said that many people traveled to an adjacent district to withdraw cash from an MTN agent there, because the big market day in their area is on Monday, and the cash out day was happening on a Tuesday. After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once. There were four types of issues that were responsible for most of the people who were unable to withdraw funds at the cash out day:\n\n=== Page 6 ===\n\n1. MTN (the payment provider) had not yet activated the funds in the person\'s account. Mr. Skeates said that this was not a common problem in the previous campaign in Uganda, but it affected many people at this cash out day. He estimated that people affected by this issue would receive their first installment of funds in another 2-3 weeks. 2. The person was registered under a different name with MTN than she or he had registered with GiveDirectly. This was a fairly common issue. Mr. Skeates said that it affected 93 out of the 1824 people currently enrolled in this campaign. 3. The person was not yet officially enrolled to receive transfers because GiveDirectly still needed to make a final visit to her or his household as part of the enrollment process. 4. The person was not enrolled to receive transfers because she or he had been found to be ineligible. As we were leaving, Mr. Skeates told us that a representative of the mobile money company (MTN) was coming to the village to help recipients with registration issues. _All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            We roughly estimated that 100 people were there when we arrived, and some people arrived or departed over the course of the event.

If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': "\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Recommendation\nNo further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            ## A conversation with Paul Niehaus and Carolina Toth, September 7, 2015\n\n### Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Interim Vice President of Fundraising and Operations, GiveDirectly\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth.\n\n### Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth of GiveDirectly for an update on its activities. Conversation topics included potential partnership projects and research studies, effects of these projects on GiveDirectly's core activities, room for more funding, and other programmatic, operational, and financial updates.\n\n### Cash transfers measured against other interventions\n\nCash transfers currently represent an estimated 5% of all humanitarian spending, although some, including the UK's Department for International Development (DFID), believe it should make up a higher percentage. Cash transfers are still a controversial intervention, and disagreement is emerging within the field of humanitarian policy over the degree to which they should be used. People who are invested in maintaining the status quo in international development are likely to push back against cash transfers.\n\n### Institutional partnerships and policy work\n\n#### Impact of partnerships and policy work on GiveDirectly's core activities\n\nGiveDirectly is engaging in or considering a number of partnerships that would involve implementing cash transfers, and also could have policy impact. Attempting to affect policy change is very high-risk, but potentially also very high-reward. It is also much harder to measure the impact of this work than the impact of a direct cash transfer. GiveDirectly does not believe its policy work is significantly different from its traditional cash transfer campaigns. In its standard activities, GiveDirectly will make decisions about who gets transfers and how recipients are randomized. When GiveDirectly is attempting to affect policy, these decisions are still made, but with explicit policy impact in mind. From this perspective, policy decisions are an extra input that precedes the execution of a project, in order to ensure that the direct action of transferring cash has the greatest possible impact.\n\nRegardless of its policy work, GiveDirectly intends to maintain its current level of cost-effectiveness by delivering 90 or 91 cents of each donated dollar directly to transfer recipients, which remains the minimum impact of the organization's activities. An indirect effect of increased funding for GiveDirectly's cash transfer programming, as well as increased positive media coverage, has been an increase in resources for GiveDirectly to invest in policy work.\n\n#### Funding structure\n\nFor any large institutional partnership, GiveDirectly pursues a 50/50 split of the costs--GiveDirectly or GiveDirectly's funders contributing money to the project increases the probability that a large institutional funder would contribute as well.\n\n#### Allocation of time by GiveDirectly management\n\nMs. Toth estimates that Dr. Niehaus spends no more than 50% of his time on institutional partnerships and believes that this is the area of GiveDirectly's work where the marginal value of his time is currently highest. Progress on partnerships with large organizations tends to be slow, as they require approvals from several people.\n\n#### Criteria for participation in partnerships\n\nTo decide whether to participate in a collaborative project, GiveDirectly must weigh benefits against costs. Many partnerships would incur fixed costs of moving to a new location or finding logistical solutions in a new area, as well as other risks and uncertainties. Potential benefits could be changing policy or changing mindset among a group of people. In particular, GiveDirectly considers the counterfactual question of what might happen if it decided not to pursue the project. For example, in one potential partnership that GiveDirectly ultimately decided not to pursue, the planned study already included a cash transfer arm as a benchmark, and GiveDirectly felt that it would add little value by acting as the implementing partner. GiveDirectly decided to limit its role to providing advice on how to design the transfers. Another partnership GiveDirectly explored was working with two large multilateral organizations to set up a comparison between cash transfers and cows in one country. GiveDirectly believed that while the potential for impact on government policy and recipient outcomes was high, the risks of moving into an unfamiliar area and using unfamiliar payment systems were too great. It was also unclear whether a large enough sample could be assembled for the cash transfer arm to constitute a scientifically credible study.\n\n#### Work with DFID\n\nDFID invited members of GiveDirectly's board to participate in a panel discussion about the role of cash transfers in humanitarian aid. However, it is hard to predict what kind of impact on policy might result from the panel's findings.\n\n### Benchmarking initiative\n\nGiveDirectly has had conversations with a non-profit that runs evaluations of aid programs about how to promote more head-to-head comparisons between cash transfers and other interventions. An informal poll among lead researchers of the non-profit's ongoing studies indicated a high level of interest in incorporating cash transfer arms. GiveDirectly likely would not undertake the work of setting up cash arms for studies due to the high costs involved, but in many places there are in-country implementing partners that could execute a cash transfer arm if they had the necessary funding. GiveDirectly would like to learn whether grantmaking organizations would be interested in funding the addition of cash transfer arms to studies. However, it would not itself fund other organizations to do this. GiveDirectly intentionally does not regrant to other organizations because the process of evaluating sub-grantees would require a huge investment of resources that GiveDirectly is not currently willing to dedicate and that would reduce efficiency.\n\n### Financial updates\n\n#### Room for more funding\n\n##### Field directors' cash transfer capacity\n\nGiveDirectly believes that its field directors in Kenya and Uganda will each have a cash transfer capacity of $17.25 million in budget year 2016 (this does not include January and February of 2016, which belong to budget year 2015). GiveDirectly is hiring a flexible field director (i.e., one who works on a variety of projects in multiple countries), Eric Friedman, who will start at the end of September.\n\n##### Future hiring opportunities\n\nHiring new field directors would not be a challenge for GiveDirectly. If it had more funds to distribute via cash transfers, it would hire more field directors and thus raise its capacity significantly. GiveDirectly's COO, Piali Mukhopadhyay, has the capacity to manage five field directors. Hiring more junior staff also presents no obstacles, as unemployment in the countries where GiveDirectly works is high. Hiring for these positions might take a month or two of the field directors' time.\n\n##### Projected use of Good Ventures funding\n\nGiveDirectly now has $25 million from Good Ventures, as well as some funds raised in the last couple of months, in unbudgeted funds. GiveDirectly would like to fully explore the possibility of finding matching funds for the Good Ventures grant before committing the Good Ventures funds to cash transfers. Once GiveDirectly has a better sense of the likelihood of securing matching funds and the pros and cons of such an arrangement, it will start to consider using the Good Ventures funding unmatched. It is possible, but somewhat unlikely, that GiveDirectly will find a large scale matching partnership very quickly. A more realistic outcome is that the search for a matching donor will extend through 2016 and beyond, which means that GiveDirectly would not use any of the Good Ventures funding in 2016.\n\n### Effect of inflation on transfer sizes\n\n#### Background\n\nA few years ago, Kenya experienced a very sharp rise in inflation (25-30% in 2011), which reduced the value of the transfers GiveDirectly distributed. Until recently, the transfer size had been pegged to an amount in Kenyan shillings (KES) or Ugandan shillings, equal to about $1,000 based on 2011 exchange rates, and was held constant at that amount. As a result, the transfers in Kenya have decreased in value along with the KES, which has masked GiveDirectly's efficiency gains since 2011, as its costs (such as wages and transportation costs) were increasing due to inflation while the size of the transfers was not.\n\n#### Adjusting transfer sizes for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly's board has thus decided to raise the amount of the transfers in Kenya by about 30%. Transfer amounts will be indexed for inflation going forward based on regular reevaluations of the inflation rate, which will likely take place every six months when the budget is refreshed. Transfers that have already been committed to recipients will not change; Kenyan recipients who were told in January 2015 that they would receive KES80,000 will still receive that amount. Recipients currently being enrolled, however, will receive about KES110,000. The historical record of GiveDirectly's transfers will not change, as the funds represented by those transfers have already been committed. In Uganda, the opposite effect has been observed, so that the value of the Uganda transfers is equivalent to about $850 or $900.\n\n#### Reasons for delay on adjusting for inflation\n\nGiveDirectly was aware of the inflation problem in 2011, but did not address the issue at the time. GiveDirectly also mistakenly thought the rate of inflation would be about 2-5%, which was much less than the actual rate. In addition, in 2011, all of GiveDirectly's programs were operating on the stop-start model, so there was more uncertainty around the future of its programs and less focus on long-term trends. The current rolling model in Kenya has brought a shift in mentality, which helped lead to the decision to adjust for inflation.\n\n#### Policy on foreign bank holdings\n\nTo protect against foreign exchange risk, GiveDirectly's policy is to only hold funds within a country if they have been committed to transfers; other budgeted liabilities are currently retained in U.S. bank accounts. However, GiveDirectly is now debating whether to increase the amount it holds in foreign currency to an amount equal to a six-month budget. This would provide a hedge against foreign exchange risk and some protection against deflation or inflation, but it would also result in greater bank risk. A six-month budget for GiveDirectly is currently $10-15 million, which is a large sum to entrust to a foreign bank, and GiveDirectly does not yet have an adequate understanding of Kenyan bank risk to make this decision.\n\n#### Setting efficiency targets for each campaign\n\nIn the past, GiveDirectly did not explicitly set efficiency targets for each campaign. Its target was consistently 91%, which represented approximately the efficiency level it had already achieved. GiveDirectly's goal at the time was to maintain that level of efficiency as it built up its program infrastructure. In Uganda, efficiency targets have typically been lower because GiveDirectly's costs in Uganda were higher at the beginning of its operations there. The most recent efficiency targets were determined during the budgeting process. The person who creates the budget for a country (usually the country's field director) looks at the costs, determines how many field officers are needed and by how much their salaries should be increased, and calculates the target efficiency based on these numbers.\n\n### Program updates\n\n#### Uganda\n\n#### Funding for October 2015-February 2016 campaign\n\nGiveDirectly plans to begin enrolling recipients for a discrete campaign in Uganda in October and November 2015. The $4.5 million GiveDirectly currently has is enough to fund enrollment through February 2016; for any enrollments beyond that, more funding would be required. If GiveDirectly has enough funding to transition Uganda to a rolling model, it will incorporate the discrete campaign into a rolling campaign. If it does not get enough funding, it will end its program in Uganda, though GiveDirectly considers this an unlikely outcome.\n\n#### Enrollment\n\nGiveDirectly is currently trying to secure government approval for all 7.3 million households in Uganda to participate in its cash transfer programs.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n## A conversation with Paul Niehaus and Carolina Toth, September 7, 2015\n\n### Participants\n\n* Paul Niehaus - Co-Founder and President, GiveDirectly\n* Carolina Toth - Interim Vice President of Fundraising and Operations, GiveDirectly\n* Rebecca Raible - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Natalie Crispin - Senior Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of the major points made by Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth. ### Summary\n\nGiveWell spoke with Dr. Niehaus and Ms. Toth of GiveDirectly for an update on its activities.

The following notes include an overview of the Dispensers for Safe Water program and the chronology of its development, as well as DSW's explanation of its process, from how it chooses areas in which to work to the continuing operational support it provides. GiveWell and Good Ventures also visited two of DSW's chlorine dispensers and talked with members of the community who were collecting water. Our notes from those visits are included in this document as well. **Note:** This is a set of summary notes compiled by GiveWell in order to give an overview of the major points made by DSW in our conversations. **Overview of Dispensers for Safe Water**\n\nInnovation for Poverty Action's (IPA's) project, Dispensers for Safe Water, installs chlorine dispensers near water collection points. Chlorine is dispensed at the source, stays in the water and continues to neutralize bacteria for a period of up to three days after the time of treatment, which addresses the issue of contamination between source and consumption. Each chlorine dispenser issues a pre-set amount of chlorine (3 mL) that is sufficient to treat about 20 liters of water, the amount held by a standard size jerry can that is commonly used for water in the villages in which DSW works. IPA has already installed 2,000 chlorine dispensers, providing access to 400,000 people. In the area that encompasses all of these dispensers, there may be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 dispensers per square kilometer. DSW has plans to add 1,000-1,100 more dispensers in Western Kenya by February 2013. Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality. **Chronology of DSW**\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\nWith water source improvement interventions, the main problems are that while water quality is improved at the source, a) in some cases, not all contamination is significantly reduced and b) many of those gains are lost at the household level because of recontamination during transport and storage, which limits the reduction in diarrhea rates. So then the question becomes, how can you improve water quality at the household level? IPA began water research in Kenya about 10 years ago to address this question. Chlorine stays in water for 1-3 days, depending on how the water is stored. This is one of big reasons to focus on chlorine - the residual effect. The way this works is that chlorine continues to bind to and neutralize organic matter and bacteria in water for as long as it has excess capacity. There is variation in the measured effects of chlorine, but on average it has been found to reduce diarrhea rates by 40%, and it is inexpensive. This number is approximate, because most data on diarrhea relies on care-givers' reports of children's illness. But chlorine decreases the contamination of water, and there is a strong case that contaminants like E. Coli and Rotavirus cause illnesses. As for why chlorine should be provided for free, studies have shown a low willingness to pay for water treatment products. One study conducted in western Kenya examined price sensitivity to bottled chlorine products sold through retail outlets. It found that charging above $0 dramatically decreased uptake. After an RCT of chlorine dispensers from 2006-2007 showed initial promising results, 20 dispensers were installed, serving a total of 3000-4000 people. From March 2009-July 2012 IPA launched multiple pilots of chlorine dispenser programs. In these pilots, IPA has partnered with a variety of government institutions, as well as explored different models of dispensers and approaches to supply chain management, promotion efforts, forms of delivery, and getting the buy in of the people involved. During this time, there were also multiple RCTs run. These studies assessed various aspects of chlorination programs, including community financing, promoter monitoring and incentives, and how public officials make decisions about the provision of public goods. DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%,and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches. For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water. === Page 3 ===\n\nAt baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%. After the dispensers were installed in the first RCT study of dispensers, 50-60% of people were treating their water, and this was verified up to 4 years after installation. **Evolution of dispensers**\n\nOver time, DSW has tried out a number of different dispenser models. Chlorine dispensers are now made of plastic. In 2010 and before, dispensers were made of metal. One issue with earlier models was that metal (especially the metal paddocks used) tended to corrode; now the containers and paddocks have been replaced with more corrosion-resistant materials. Note that when GiveWell/Good Ventures visited the IPA office in Kisumu, we saw a number of examples of dispensers that were tried out and replaced with newer versions. **Costs to implement dispensers for safe water**\n\nDSW breaks down the direct implementation costs into 2 buckets:\n\n1. Initial implementation (from the decision to install dispensers through the installation, including materials, community education, transportation, staff time, etc.) costs $200/chlorine dispenser; this will go down over time. 2. Ongoing operations (ensuring that the dispensers continue to function and increasing the rate at which they are used) are projected to cost $65/dispenser/year at scale. This includes chlorine supply, maintenance, hardware replacement after its projected lifespan, M&E, management costs and all overheads. **DSW implementation process**\n\n1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density. 2. **Meet local stakeholders from the district to location-level governments. **\n3. **Meet with local leaders** (e.g., church leaders, village elders) to discuss the possibility of installing dispensers. These officials provide lists of all water points in the areas they represent. 4. **Select the water points at which DSW will work. **\n5. **Host community meetings in areas that DSW has selected**. The meeting is advertised by calling village elders, posting notices, announcements by megaphone, and by meeting with a couple villagers initially and asking them to tell others about the meeting. Community meetings serve to sensitize the community members to the program and inform them of the benefits of chlorine, as well as to ask if they are ready to have the program (to formally secure their\n\n=== Page 4 ===\n\nbuy in). At community meetings, DSW staff explain how to use the chlorine dispensers to treat water, address any problems people raise, and collect phone numbers of community members for use when DSW sends text messages to promote the use of the dispensers. DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it. 6. **Choose water points for dispensers. ** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria. 7. **Install the dispensers. **\n8. **Host a smaller meeting at each water point** where a dispenser was installed so that people can see it and be reminded of how to treat their water. 9. **Attendees of this meeting elect a person from the village to be the official chlorine dispenser promoter** by show of hands or secret ballot. The promoters are charged with refilling dispensers with the chlorine supplies that DSW delivers, ensuring the dispenser is in working order, communicating any issues to DSW staff, and reaching out to people to encourage them to use the dispenser. Promoters are given chlorine dispenser promoter T-shirts, and are sometimes given a small gift such as $1 of phone credit per month, but in the past have otherwise been unpaid. DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water. 10. **Provide services for ongoing operation** of each water point: chlorine supply, fixing malfunctioning dispensers, marketing to increase uptake, monitoring and evaluation (DSW conducts 2-month, 4-month and 12-month evaluations for the 2100 dispensers it has installed) DSW's field work is done by field associates who collect data, hold community meetings, etc, and by community field assistants who deliver the chlorine. DSW also has an area coordinator and associate area coordinator, to whom the field staff report. They in turn report to the Operations Manager. Field visits for chlorine delivery currently occur about every 3 months, but DSW is exploring reducing visits to 2-3 times per year. === Page 5 ===\n\nThe field associates visit a sample of households using the chlorine dispenser, and test for levels of chlorine present in stored household drinking water. [We did not discuss the results in depth during this meeting]. DSW also collects survey data in addition to monitoring chlorine levels. **Observations from visit to chlorine dispenser sites**\n\nWe visited two chlorine dispensers installed at water points located close together (no more than a half mile apart), in a rural area of Busia. We had the opportunity to speak with the DSW promoter at the first spring. The spring was protected in 2009 (spring protection involves building a cement structure to encase the spring area and inserting pipes to channel spring water. This prevents water from the spring becoming mixed with contaminants from the pooling water around it before it is collected). The promoter at the first dispenser site told us that about 300 people collect water from this spring, and DSW told us that the usage rate at this location was 33% (meaning that during the last random visit to this spring, 33% of the households sampled had detectable chlorine in their stored drinking water). The promoter said that he comes to the spring weekly to encourage people to use the chlorine.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **Visit by Good Ventures and GiveWell to Innovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water, November 8-9, 2012**\n\n**Participants:**\n\nInnovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW): Eric Kouskalis, _Program Director, Dispensers for Safe Water_; Evan Green-Lowe, _Research and Evaluations Manager, Dispensers for Safe Water_; Peter Mwaura, _Program Operations Manager, Dispensers for Safe Water_; as well as 12 field and community associates of the DSW team (present on November 9)\n\nGood Ventures: Cari Tuna, _President_\n\nGiveWell: Elie Hassenfeld, _Co-Executive Director_; Eliza Scheffler, _Research Analyst_; Stephanie Wykstra, _Research Analyst_\n\n**Summary:** In Kenya, GiveWell and Good Ventures met with Innovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) team to discuss their projects and to visit 2 on-site.

Field visits for chlorine delivery currently occur about every 3 months, but DSW is exploring reducing visits to 2-3 times per year.\n\nThe field associates visit a sample of households using the chlorine dispenser, and test for levels of chlorine present in stored household drinking water. [We did not discuss the results in depth during this meeting]. DSW also collects survey data in addition to monitoring chlorine levels. **Observations from visit to chlorine dispenser sites**\n\nWe visited two chlorine dispensers installed at water points located close together (no more than a half mile apart), in a rural area of Busia. We had the opportunity to speak with the DSW promoter at the first spring. The spring was protected in 2009 (spring protection involves building a cement structure to encase the spring area and inserting pipes to channel spring water. This prevents water from the spring becoming mixed with contaminants from the pooling water around it before it is collected). The promoter at the first dispenser site told us that about 300 people collect water from this spring, and DSW told us that the usage rate at this location was 33% (meaning that during the last random visit to this spring, 33% of the households sampled had detectable chlorine in their stored drinking water). The promoter said that he comes to the spring weekly to encourage people to use the chlorine.\n        ", 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your task is to compare the Original Text against the Restructured Output produced. Based on the comparison, you must itemize any deviations or errors in the Restructured Output and provide precise and actionable feedback.\n\n## 1. Comparison Criteria\nCarefully compare the Original Text and the Restructured (Markdown) Output according to the following points:\n\n### No Summarization or Paraphrasing\n- Verify that the Restructured Output includes all original sentences exactly as they appear in the Original Text (except for line merges or boilerplate removals).  \n- No sentences should be condensed, reworded, rephrased, or have its grammar corrected.\n\n### No Commentary\n- Confirm that the Restructured Output contains only the cleaned text and no added notes, explanations, disclaimers, or references to the cleaning process.\n\n### Boilerplate Removal\n- Check that any repeated boilerplate text (e.g., cookie notices, repeated disclaimers, footers, headers) has been removed in the Restructured Output. Use the boilerplate examples below as a guide; remove any similar repeated text blocks that do not contribute to the main content. \n- If boilerplate or repeated text was supposed to be removed but still appears, flag it as an error.\n\n### Sentence Reconstruction\n- Confirm that sentences fragmented across lines or pages in the Original Text have been correctly merged into coherent sentences in the Restructured Output. \n- Verify that ellipses (…) are used only when text is truly missing or incomplete.\n\n### Markdown Formatting\n- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) are used correctly based on the text’s structure.  \n- Paragraph Spacing: Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.  \n- Lists (`-` or `*`) should only be used if the Original Text indicates a list.  \n- Ensure no extra heading duplicates or unintended heading level changes.\n\n### Content Preservation\n- Confirm that no meaningful text (beyond boilerplate or known footers/headers) has been removed or added incorrectly.\n- Use the boilerplate examples below to help you identify boilerplate.\n- If you find text missing or erroneously added, flag it.\n\n## 2. Identifying Errors\nList each error you find as a separate bullet or item, following the error-reporting format below. For each error:\n<error-reporting format>\n# Error Type: [Specific error category]\n- Description: [Concise description of the issue]\n- Location: [Where it appears in the Original Text and/or Restructured Output]\n- Suggestion: [Clear recommendation for fixing the issue]\n</error-reporting format>\n\n## 3. Output Requirements\n- Strictly follow the error-reporting format. Do not add any additional commentary or headings outside the bullet items and final recommendation.\n- If no errors are found, you may simply provide a single recommendation stating that no further changes are needed.\n\n<example-feedback-output>\n# Example 1.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The paragraph about "Grant structure" is entirely missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 3 ("Grant structure"); Restructured Output, Section 2.\n- Suggestion: Insert the "Grant structure" section at the correct location in the Restructured Output.\n\n# Example 2.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: The heading "Evaluation and experimentation" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of level 3 (###).\n- Location: Original Text, Page 12; Restructured Output, Section titled "### Evaluation and experimentation"\n- Suggestion: Change "###" to "##" to match the text’s structure.\n\n# Example 3. \n# Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed\n- Description: The repeated cookie notice "We\'ve placed functionality cookies..." still appears in the Restructured Output on multiple pages.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Restructured Output, near the beginning and end.\n- Suggestion: Remove the repeated cookie banners in line with boilerplate removal instructions.\n\n# Example 4.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction\n- Description: The sentence "GiveDirectly staff are the main point of contact..." is broken mid-line with a period inserted, creating two partial sentences.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 32; Restructured Output, paragraph 2.\n- Suggestion: Merge the fragmented line into one coherent sentence without altering the wording.\n\n# Example 5. \n# Error Type: Extra Commentary\n- Description: The Restructured Output includes the line "We eliminated boilerplate from these pages," which is not in the Original Text.\n- Location: Restructured Output, Page 4, last paragraph.\n- Suggestion: Remove all commentary about the cleaning process; only the cleaned text should remain.\n\n# Example 6.\n# Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The footnotes referencing “Haushofer and Shapiro 2013” are missing in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 69 & 70; Restructured Output, final pages.\n- Suggestion: Insert the references (or footnotes) exactly as in the Original Text. If footnotes are not converted to Markdown, ensure the references appear as plain text.\n\n# Example 7.\n# Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting\n- Description: Headings for "Spending breakdown" and "Differences in cost-effectiveness" are merged into a single heading.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 18; Restructured Output, Section 2 heading.\n- Suggestion: Separate them into two distinct headings: "## Spending breakdown" and "## Differences in cost-effectiveness."\n\n# Example 8.\n# Error Type: Missing Boilerplate Removal\n- Description: The repeated header "FiveWell | Giving Effectively | HOW we work" remains at the start of each page in the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 1 (and repeated on multiple pages); Restructured Output, top lines in each section.\n- Suggestion: Remove navigation headers from all pages.\n\n# Example 9.\n# Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Error\n- Description: The sentence "In 2014, three members of GiveDirectly\'s board started the for-profit company Segovia..." is interrupted halfway through, creating two incomplete clauses.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 9; Restructured Output, Paragraph 4.\n- Suggestion: Merge it into one coherent line exactly as in the Original Text.\n\n# Example 10.\n# Error Type: Missing Contact Info\n- Description: The line with "Contact us: SCI Foundation is recommended by: ..." is absent from the final output, though it only appears once and is relevant.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 5; Restructured Output, after paragraph 6.\n- Suggestion: Restore this single-occurrence line, as it is not flagged as boilerplate.\n\n</example-feedback-output>\n\n<Boilerplate examples>\n# Example 1.

In addition to conversations with GiveDirectly staff, GiveWell went to 2 villages to meet with recipients and observed a cash out day. ## Meeting with recipients\n\nOn October 20, 2014, we (GiveWell staff) travelled with GiveDirectly to Kavo and Apungure, adjacent villages located about one hour\'s drive outside of Mbale, a small city in southeastern Uganda. Both villages had been part of GiveDirectly\'s first campaign in Uganda (the "Uganda pilot"). At the time of our visit, all transfers had been made to households in that campaign, and final follow up surveys were ongoing. GiveDirectly had randomly selected a short list of households that we could visit, and then called each of them ahead of time to make an appointment. We ended up visiting 2 households in Kavo and 2 households in Apungure. We were accompanied on these visits by GiveDirectly staff, one of which translated our conversations with recipients. The below notes summarize what recipients told us in those conversations. **Household #1 (Paul)**\n\n* There are 11 people in Paul\'s family who all live on the same compound. * Paul is not married, he lives alone, and he is the only beneficiary in his family. * Paul farms, as does the rest of his family; Paul does not have any other jobs. * Paul received 2.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$960) from GiveDirectly. (50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) had been deducted because Paul opted to buy a cell phone through GiveDirectly, and the other 50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) was taken in the case of GD staff fraud.) * Paul used 1 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$450) to cover 2 years of school fees (Senior 1 and Senior 2 levels.) Paul thinks he could pass the exams necessary to finish school, but has not sat for them (there are fees associated with secondary school exams).Paul said that if he were able to complete Senior 4, he could then go to school to become a mechanic, but he does not currently have enough funds to\n\n=== Page 2 ===\n\ncomplete Senior 4. Paul said that in the long run, he will be better off because of his spending on education. * Paul used 450,000 UGX (~$180) to purchase 18 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX per sheet. He stores these iron sheets inside his father\'s house, which is larger and has an iron roof. Paul said that he does not have enough sheets for a full roof yet. * Paul said that he is trying to make bricks out of mud so that he can build a new house and put a roof on it by February 2015. * Paul said that he wants to replace his thatch roof because finding the special kind of grass needed for the roofs is difficult, and because sometimes termites attack him. * Paul used some of the funds for domestic expenses. * Paul has 300,000 UGX (~$120) left from the transfer; he is keeping this money (in cash) in case of an emergency. * Paul said that he chose to spend the money in these ways because his father has some land, which Paul expects to inherit some day. * When we asked about the money that had been deducted from his transfer, Paul said that he had been told 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the phone and 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the SIM card, and that no one called the hotline to report this extremely high price for a SIM card because the person running the hotline was one of the staff who told recipients about the SIM card deduction. * When we asked if Paul thinks it would be better to give a smaller sized transfer to more people (rather than keeping transfer size at $1000), he said that since he\'s in need of more money, he wouldn\'t want to reduce the size of the transfer. * When we asked if there is anything that GD could do differently, Paul said increase the transfer size. * We also asked if Paul had seen any good or bad spending, and he said that some people spent money on alcohol. * Paul asked GiveDirectly staff if the deduction from his transfer was "genuine" and whether it would be replaced. GiveDirectly staff explained that the deduction for the phone was genuine, and the second one for the SIM card was not. ### Household #2 (Gilbert)\n\n* There are 5 people in Gilbert\'s household: Gilbert, his wife, and 3 children. * Gilbert said that he received 2.39 million UGX (~$960) from GiveDirectly. * The first thing that Gilbert spent transfer funds on was domestic items that he lacked, including a mattress, plates, saucepans, and cups. * Gilbert used some of the transfer funds to build a brick and cement house with iron roof: * Iron sheets were purchased from Katongole; 14 sheets at a price of 26,000 UGX per sheet * Other building materials were purchased within his village * Labor costs: 400,000 UGX (~$160) for masons, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for mixers, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for water for laborers * House took 3 months to build\n\n=== Page 3 ===\n\n* Gilbert said that the problems with having a match roof are that heavy rains can blow the roof off, and moderate rains will cause the roof to leak. * Gilbert spent some of the transfer funds on medical treatments for malaria and other illnesses. * Gilbert spent some of the transfer funds on supplies for agriculture (he specifically mentioned seeds and leasing land for one year.) Gilbert said that he farms mainly for consumption, but could sell some of the produce in case of financial hardship. Gilbert farms maize, cassava, sweet potato and soya beans. * Gilbert said that he does not have enough land, so cannot raise animals. * Gilbert does not have any funds remaining from the transfer. * Gilbert said that he withdrew cash at the cash out days GiveDirectly coordinated at a nearby church, and that he stored materials because he could not store cash. * When we asked whether Gilbert thought it was better for households in one village to receive $1000 each or households in 2 villages to receive $500, he said that the amount of the transfer ($1000) should stay the same. * Gilbert said that no other charities work in his village. **Household #3 (Scovia)**\n\n* 5 people in Scovia\'s household: Scovia, her husband, their child, her husband\'s other wife (Scovia\'s "co-wife"), child of husband and co-wife. * Scovia was the official recipient. When we met with her near her household, her husband joined. Scovia\'s husband answered nearly all of the questions that we asked. * Scovia\'s husband told us that his father had incurred a debt of 20 cows, which he asked his sons for help in paying off. The debt was: 10 cows for the dowry from the father\'s marriage 10 cows for traditional healing the father had sought as treatment for a problem with spirits\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he spent 1.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$560) to purchase 2 bulls and 2 cows to help his father pay off this debt. * Paying off the debt from the traditional healing enabled Scovia\'s husband to reclaim some land. * Scovia\'s husband also spent 425,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$170) on 17 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10) per sheet. Scovia\'s husband said that he wanted to use the money to construct a new house but could not do so with the debt outstanding. He said that match roofs leak and the wind can blow them away. * Separate from the transfer, Scovia\'s husband had saved 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260) over about 1 year to buy a motorcycle, and he said he used the rest of the transfer (about 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260)) to top up these funds and make the purchase. Scovia\'s husband said he has been working as a motorcycle taxi driver. On a bad day, his revenue is 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4), on a good day, his revenue is 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10), and he spends about 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) per day on food and gas when he is working. === Page 4 ===\n\n* Scovia\'s husband also said that he/his household [we didn\'t clarify] earn money by planting rice. In a good season, they will harvest 10 bags of 100kg each of rice, which brings in 2.5 million UGX ($1000). * Scovia\'s husband said that before receiving the transfer from GiveDirectly, getting a meal was a problem, and he didn\'t have seeds or land. Since receiving the transfer, he bought animals and got married. * Scovia said that she and her husband had agreed as to how to spend the money. * Scovia\'s husband said that he thinks his elder wife should be eligible for a transfer, though she did not receive one. He also asked about the transfer deductions from the staff fraud. #### Household #4 (Betty)\n\n* Betty lives in a match-roof house with her very young child, on a compound owned by her relatives. * Betty said that she has lived on her own for 3 years. * Betty farms, mostly for consumption, but will sell crops if she needs money for an emergency or to buy basics like soap, sugar, and medical treatments. * Betty used 2 million UGX (~$800) to buy a piece of land from her great uncle, which she paid for in installments as she received the transfer. Betty said that the time will come when she needs to be independent of her family and will build a house on the land. Currently she has used the land to plant cassava. * Other purchases: 60,000 UGX (~$24) on a mattress, 80,000 UGX (~$32) on bedding, 180,000 UGX (~$72) on pigs. Betty said that she bought the pigs young and plans to sell them once they reach adulthood. * There were multiple people sitting nearby as we spoke to Betty, she said that they are happy for her even though they didn\'t benefit, and that they think GiveDirectly might come back and give them transfers. * When we asked Betty if she thinks GiveDirectly should continue to give $1000 to people in one village or a smaller amount to people in more villages, she said that GiveDirectly should increase the amount of the transfer. ### Observing a cash out day\n\n#### Why GiveDirectly conducts cash out days\n\nIn Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent. #### Our observations of a cash out day\n\nWe observed a cash out day in Uganda that took place in October 2014 as part of the Uganda 2M campaign. The below information is based on our observations of that cash out day and conversations about it with GiveDirectly staff. === Page 5 ===\n\nPrior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals. Upon arriving at the designated site for the cash out day (near a secondary school), many village members were already gathered.\n\n            Against the Restructured Output:\n            **Site visit with GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014**\n\n**Participants**\n\n* Piali Mukhopadhyay - COO, International, GiveDirectly\n* Stuart Skeates - Uganda Field Director, GiveDirectly\n* Steven Olinga - Field Officer, GiveDirectly\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Josh Rosenberg - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of GiveWell\'s visit to GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda.\n\n## Summary\n\nOn October 20-21, 2014, GiveWell staff visited GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda.

Paul said that he does not have enough sheets for a full roof yet.\n* Paul said that he is trying to make bricks out of mud so that he can build a new house and put a roof on it by February 2015.\n* Paul said that he wants to replace his thatch roof because finding the special kind of grass needed for the roofs is difficult, and because sometimes termites attack him.\n* Paul used some of the funds for domestic expenses.\n* Paul has 300,000 UGX (~$120) left from the transfer; he is keeping this money (in cash) in case of an emergency.\n* Paul said that he chose to spend the money in these ways because his father has some land, which Paul expects to inherit some day.\n* When we asked about the money that had been deducted from his transfer, Paul said that he had been told 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the phone and 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the SIM card, and that no one called the hotline to report this extremely high price for a SIM card because the person running the hotline was one of the staff who told recipients about the SIM card deduction.\n* When we asked if Paul thinks it would be better to give a smaller sized transfer to more people (rather than keeping transfer size at $1000), he said that since he\'s in need of more money, he wouldn\'t want to reduce the size of the transfer.\n* When we asked if there is anything that GD could do differently, Paul said increase the transfer size.\n* We also asked if Paul had seen any good or bad spending, and he said that some people spent money on alcohol.\n* Paul asked GiveDirectly staff if the deduction from his transfer was "genuine" and whether it would be replaced. GiveDirectly staff explained that the deduction for the phone was genuine, and the second one for the SIM card was not.\n\n### Household #2 (Gilbert)\n\n* There are 5 people in Gilbert\'s household: Gilbert, his wife, and 3 children.\n* Gilbert said that he received 2.39 million UGX (~$960) from GiveDirectly.\n* The first thing that Gilbert spent transfer funds on was domestic items that he lacked, including a mattress, plates, saucepans, and cups.\n* Gilbert used some of the transfer funds to build a brick and cement house with iron roof:\n  * Iron sheets were purchased from Katongole; 14 sheets at a price of 26,000 UGX per sheet\n  * Other building materials were purchased within his village\n  * Labor costs: 400,000 UGX (~$160) for masons, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for mixers, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for water for laborers\n  * House took 3 months to build\n\n### Household #3 (Scovia)\n\n* 5 people in Scovia\'s household: Scovia, her husband, their child, her husband\'s other wife (Scovia\'s "co-wife"), child of husband and co-wife.\n* Scovia was the official recipient. When we met with her near her household, her husband joined. Scovia\'s husband answered nearly all of the questions that we asked.\n* Scovia\'s husband told us that his father had incurred a debt of 20 cows, which he asked his sons for help in paying off. The debt was: 10 cows for the dowry from the father\'s marriage; 10 cows for traditional healing the father had sought as treatment for a problem with spirits.\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he spent 1.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$560) to purchase 2 bulls and 2 cows to help his father pay off this debt.\n* Paying off the debt from the traditional healing enabled Scovia\'s husband to reclaim some land.\n* Scovia\'s husband also spent 425,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$170) on 17 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10) per sheet. Scovia\'s husband said that he wanted to use the money to construct a new house but could not do so with the debt outstanding. He said that match roofs leak and the wind can blow them away.\n* Separate from the transfer, Scovia\'s husband had saved 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260) over about 1 year to buy a motorcycle, and he said he used the rest of the transfer (about 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260)) to top up these funds and make the purchase. Scovia\'s husband said he has been working as a motorcycle taxi driver. On a bad day, his revenue is 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4), on a good day, his revenue is 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10), and he spends about 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) per day on food and gas when he is working.\n\n* Scovia\'s husband also said that he/his household [we didn\'t clarify] earn money by planting rice. In a good season, they will harvest 10 bags of 100kg each of rice, which brings in 2.5 million UGX ($1000).\n* Scovia\'s husband said that before receiving the transfer from GiveDirectly, getting a meal was a problem, and he didn\'t have seeds or land. Since receiving the transfer, he bought animals and got married.\n* Scovia said that she and her husband had agreed as to how to spend the money.\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he thinks his elder wife should be eligible for a transfer, though she did not receive one. He also asked about the transfer deductions from the staff fraud.\n\n#### Household #4 (Betty)\n\n* Betty lives in a match-roof house with her very young child, on a compound owned by her relatives.\n* Betty said that she has lived on her own for 3 years.\n* Betty farms, mostly for consumption, but will sell crops if she needs money for an emergency or to buy basics like soap, sugar, and medical treatments.\n* Betty used 2 million UGX (~$800) to buy a piece of land from her great uncle, which she paid for in installments as she received the transfer. Betty said that the time will come when she needs to be independent of her family and will build a house on the land. Currently she has used the land to plant cassava.\n* Other purchases: 60,000 UGX (~$24) on a mattress, 80,000 UGX (~$32) on bedding, 180,000 UGX (~$72) on pigs. Betty said that she bought the pigs young and plans to sell them once they reach adulthood.\n* There were multiple people sitting nearby as we spoke to Betty, she said that they are happy for her even though they didn\'t benefit, and that they think GiveDirectly might come back and give them transfers.\n* When we asked Betty if she thinks GiveDirectly should continue to give $1000 to people in one village or a smaller amount to people in more villages, she said that GiveDirectly should increase the amount of the transfer.\n\n### Observing a cash out day\n\n#### Why GiveDirectly conducts cash out days\n\nIn Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.\n\n#### Our observations of a cash out day\n\nWe observed a cash out day in Uganda that took place in October 2014 as part of the Uganda 2M campaign. The below information is based on our observations of that cash out day and conversations about it with GiveDirectly staff.\n\nPrior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals. Upon arriving at the designated site for the cash out day (near a secondary school), many village members were already gathered.\n        ', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'o3-mini', 'reasoning_effort': 'low', 'stream': False}}

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Recommendation\nNo further changes are needed.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            We roughly estimated that 100 people were there when we arrived, and some people arrived or departed over the course of the event. It appeared that many people had come just to observe the event rather than to withdraw transfers. Mr. Skeates, the Uganda Field Director, made announcements at the start of the event, translated by the 2 community monitors. The announcements included reminders about how to keep account information secure (e.g., after entering your PIN number, make sure to press "send" before handing your phone back to the agent; make sure you have received a confirmation message after withdrawing and that it states the correct amount; count the cash immediately after receiving it.)\n\nAfter announcements, the three mobile money agents set up their stations - two were sitting on chairs under a large tree and the third was sitting in the MTN van with another person who we assumed was affiliated with MTN. One community monitor sat near the two agents under the tree and one stood near the van window. The community monitor by the tree appeared to mostly be observing transactions, while the one by the van was playing more of an intermediary role. We saw many people with small purses or wallets to hold their money, and some who carried it by hand. Mr. Skeates noted that far fewer people were withdrawing cash at this cash out day than he had expected. In total, we estimated that about 40 people withdrew cash at the event, while 380 people across two villages had received transfers.\n\nMr. Skeates asked an English-speaking village member about this, who said that many people traveled to an adjacent district to withdraw cash from an MTN agent there, because the big market day in their area is on Monday, and the cash out day was happening on a Tuesday. After withdrawals had started, it was announced that anyone who was unable to withdraw cash should gather at a certain location. Names and GD identification numbers of these people were collected. Mr. Skeates then had an English-speaking village member read him a name and GD identification number while he looked the person up in a database on his lap top. At first, Mr. Skeates called each person over individually, asked her or him a few questions, and explained what he knew about the reason they were unable to withdraw cash. Mr. Skeates was being translated by the English-speaking village member. After a few individual meetings, Mr. Skeates decided instead to look up all of the people at once and group them by type of issue, so that he could speak to each group of people at once.\n\nThere were four types of issues that were responsible for most of the people who were unable to withdraw funds at the cash out day:\n\n1. MTN (the payment provider) had not yet activated the funds in the person\'s account. Mr. Skeates said that this was not a common problem in the previous campaign in Uganda, but it affected many people at this cash out day. He estimated that people affected by this issue would receive their first installment of funds in another 2-3 weeks.\n2. The person was registered under a different name with MTN than she or he had registered with GiveDirectly. This was a fairly common issue. Mr. Skeates said that it affected 93 out of the 1824 people currently enrolled in this campaign.\n3. The person was not yet officially enrolled to receive transfers because GiveDirectly still needed to make a final visit to her or his household as part of the enrollment process.\n4. The person was not enrolled to receive transfers because she or he had been found to be ineligible.\n\nAs we were leaving, Mr. Skeates told us that a representative of the mobile money company (MTN) was coming to the village to help recipients with registration issues.\n\n_All GiveWell conversations are available at http://www.givewell.org/conversations_\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            We roughly estimated that 100 people were there when we arrived, and some people arrived or departed over the course of the event.

The following notes include an overview of the Dispensers for Safe Water program and the chronology of its development, as well as DSW's explanation of its process, from how it chooses areas in which to work to the continuing operational support it provides. GiveWell and Good Ventures also visited two of DSW's chlorine dispensers and talked with members of the community who were collecting water. Our notes from those visits are included in this document as well. **Note:** This is a set of summary notes compiled by GiveWell in order to give an overview of the major points made by DSW in our conversations. **Overview of Dispensers for Safe Water**\n\nInnovation for Poverty Action's (IPA's) project, Dispensers for Safe Water, installs chlorine dispensers near water collection points. Chlorine is dispensed at the source, stays in the water and continues to neutralize bacteria for a period of up to three days after the time of treatment, which addresses the issue of contamination between source and consumption. Each chlorine dispenser issues a pre-set amount of chlorine (3 mL) that is sufficient to treat about 20 liters of water, the amount held by a standard size jerry can that is commonly used for water in the villages in which DSW works. IPA has already installed 2,000 chlorine dispensers, providing access to 400,000 people. In the area that encompasses all of these dispensers, there may be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 dispensers per square kilometer. DSW has plans to add 1,000-1,100 more dispensers in Western Kenya by February 2013. Western Kenya is a good place to scale up chlorine dispensers because the people living there have relatively good access to water, high diarrhea rates, and there is high population density. This means that creating water sources is a lower priority in many areas, but there is a significant need to improve water quality. **Chronology of DSW**\n\nWith water source improvement interventions, the main problems are that while water quality is improved at the source, a) in some cases, not all contamination is significantly reduced and b) many of those gains are lost at the household level because of recontamination during transport and storage, which limits the reduction in diarrhea rates. So then the question becomes, how can you improve water quality at the household level? IPA began water research in Kenya about 10 years ago to address this question. Chlorine stays in water for 1-3 days, depending on how the water is stored. This is one of big reasons to focus on chlorine - the residual effect. The way this works is that chlorine continues to bind to and neutralize organic matter and bacteria in water for as long as it has excess capacity. There is variation in the measured effects of chlorine, but on average it has been found to reduce diarrhea rates by 40%, and it is inexpensive. This number is approximate, because most data on diarrhea relies on care-givers' reports of children's illness. But chlorine decreases the contamination of water, and there is a strong case that contaminants like E. Coli and Rotavirus cause illnesses. As for why chlorine should be provided for free, studies have shown a low willingness to pay for water treatment products. One study conducted in western Kenya examined price sensitivity to bottled chlorine products sold through retail outlets. It found that charging above $0 dramatically decreased uptake. After an RCT of chlorine dispensers from 2006-2007 showed initial promising results, 20 dispensers were installed, serving a total of 3000-4000 people. From March 2009-July 2012 IPA launched multiple pilots of chlorine dispenser programs. In these pilots, IPA has partnered with a variety of government institutions, as well as explored different models of dispensers and approaches to supply chain management, promotion efforts, forms of delivery, and getting the buy in of the people involved. During this time, there were also multiple RCTs run. These studies assessed various aspects of chlorination programs, including community financing, promoter monitoring and incentives, and how public officials make decisions about the provision of public goods. DSW found a variety of outcomes with different pilots, studies and models, with adoption rates ranging from anywhere from 15-60%,and has begun scaling up the most promising while continuing to test new approaches. For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water.\n\nAt baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%. After the dispensers were installed in the first RCT study of dispensers, 50-60% of people were treating their water, and this was verified up to 4 years after installation. **Evolution of dispensers**\n\nOver time, DSW has tried out a number of different dispenser models. Chlorine dispensers are now made of plastic. In 2010 and before, dispensers were made of metal. One issue with earlier models was that metal (especially the metal paddocks used) tended to corrode; now the containers and paddocks have been replaced with more corrosion-resistant materials. Note that when GiveWell/Good Ventures visited the IPA office in Kisumu, we saw a number of examples of dispensers that were tried out and replaced with newer versions. **Costs to implement dispensers for safe water**\n\nDSW breaks down the direct implementation costs into 2 buckets:\n\n1. Initial implementation (from the decision to install dispensers through the installation, including materials, community education, transportation, staff time, etc.) costs $200/chlorine dispenser; this will go down over time. \n2. Ongoing operations (ensuring that the dispensers continue to function and increasing the rate at which they are used) are projected to cost $65/dispenser/year at scale. This includes chlorine supply, maintenance, hardware replacement after its projected lifespan, M&E, management costs and all overheads. **DSW implementation process**\n\n1. **Choose areas in which DSW will work** using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.\n2. **Meet local stakeholders from the district to location-level governments.**\n3. **Meet with local leaders** (e.g., church leaders, village elders) to discuss the possibility of installing dispensers. These officials provide lists of all water points in the areas they represent.\n4. **Select the water points at which DSW will work.**\n5. **Host community meetings in areas that DSW has selected.** The meeting is advertised by calling village elders, posting notices, announcements by megaphone, and by meeting with a couple villagers initially and asking them to tell others about the meeting. Community meetings serve to sensitize the community members to the program and inform them of the benefits of chlorine, as well as to ask if they are ready to have the program (to formally secure their buy in). At community meetings, DSW staff explain how to use the chlorine dispensers to treat water, address any problems people raise, and collect phone numbers of community members for use when DSW sends text messages to promote the use of the dispensers. DSW also asks for a small contribution of sand and other materials needed to install the dispenser, as well as a mason from the community who can help install it.\n6. **Choose water points for dispensers.** DSW's criteria for placing a dispenser near a water source: the water source must have low to moderate turbidity (because chlorine is less effective in treating highly turbid water); the source must have at least 10 households using it; the source must be working for at least 9 months out of the year; and, in situations where the water point is located on privately-owned land, the land-owner must be amenable to the dispenser. About 65-75% of water points in an area meet these criteria.\n7. **Install the dispensers.**\n8. **Host a smaller meeting at each water point** where a dispenser was installed so that people can see it and be reminded of how to treat their water.\n9. **Attendees of this meeting elect a person from the village to be the official chlorine dispenser promoter** by show of hands or secret ballot. The promoters are charged with refilling dispensers with the chlorine supplies that DSW delivers, ensuring the dispenser is in working order, communicating any issues to DSW staff, and reaching out to people to encourage them to use the dispenser. Promoters are given chlorine dispenser promoter T-shirts, and are sometimes given a small gift such as $1 of phone credit per month, but in the past have otherwise been unpaid. DSW is studying variations on the incentives it offers promoters: it is experimenting with offering cash incentives, such that the promoter earns a reward for each household with chlorine present in their collected drinking water. It is also trying out a non-linear model in which the promoter is rewarded when the community reaches a certain percentage of households with chlorinated water.\n10. **Provide services for ongoing operation** of each water point: chlorine supply, fixing malfunctioning dispensers, marketing to increase uptake, monitoring and evaluation (DSW conducts 2-month, 4-month and 12-month evaluations for the 2100 dispensers it has installed). DSW's field work is done by field associates who collect data, hold community meetings, etc, and by community field assistants who deliver the chlorine. DSW also has an area coordinator and associate area coordinator, to whom the field staff report. They in turn report to the Operations Manager. Field visits for chlorine delivery currently occur about every 3 months, but DSW is exploring reducing visits to 2-3 times per year.\n\nThe field associates visit a sample of households using the chlorine dispenser, and test for levels of chlorine present in stored household drinking water. [We did not discuss the results in depth during this meeting]. DSW also collects survey data in addition to monitoring chlorine levels. **Observations from visit to chlorine dispenser sites**\n\nWe visited two chlorine dispensers installed at water points located close together (no more than a half mile apart), in a rural area of Busia. We had the opportunity to speak with the DSW promoter at the first spring. The spring was protected in 2009 (spring protection involves building a cement structure to encase the spring area and inserting pipes to channel spring water. This prevents water from the spring becoming mixed with contaminants from the pooling water around it before it is collected). The promoter at the first dispenser site told us that about 300 people collect water from this spring, and DSW told us that the usage rate at this location was 33% (meaning that during the last random visit to this spring, 33% of the households sampled had detectable chlorine in their stored drinking water). The promoter said that he comes to the spring weekly to encourage people to use the chlorine.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n**Visit by Good Ventures and GiveWell to Innovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water, November 8-9, 2012**\n\n**Participants:**\n\nInnovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW): Eric Kouskalis,\n\n_Program Director, Dispensers for Safe Water_; Evan Green-Lowe, _Research and Evaluations Manager, Dispensers for Safe Water_; Peter Mwaura, _Program Operations Manager, Dispensers for Safe Water_; as well as 12 field and community associates of the DSW team (present on November 9)\n\nGood Ventures: Cari Tuna, _President_\n\nGiveWell: Elie Hassenfeld, _Co-Executive Director_; Eliza Scheffler, _Research Analyst_; Stephanie Wykstra, _Research Analyst_\n\n**Summary:** In Kenya, GiveWell and Good Ventures met with Innovations for Poverty Action's Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) team to discuss their projects and to visit 2 on-site.

Your primary objective is to ensure the "Cleaned Text" accurately reflects the content and intent of the "Original Text," with a particular focus on addressing major content omissions before attending to minor formatting issues.\n\n**Process:**\n1.  **Prioritization:** Address errors based on the following priority:\n    1.  **Critical:** Missing Content, Incorrect Information\n    2.  **Important:** Structural Issues, Incorrect Table Values, Logical Flow Problems\n    3.  **Minor:** Formatting Issues, Stylistic Inconsistencies\n2.  **Missing Content Reconstruction:**\n    *   For each "Missing Content" error, locate the corresponding section in the "Original Text."\n    *   Iteratively add back missing sections, using the "Original Text" as a guide. Do not simply add section headings without content.\n    *   Summarize or paraphrase the content from the "Original Text" to fill the gaps, ensuring the reconstructed text flows logically and maintains a consistent style with the existing "Cleaned Text." If sections are too large, consider the feasibility of breaking them down further, adding each subsection individually if necessary.\n    *   Pay close attention to the context of the missing content to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding text.\n3. **Table Value Correction:**\n    * For each table identified in the feedback, carefully compare the values in the "Cleaned Text" table with those in the corresponding section of the "Original Text."\n    * Correct any discrepancies in the table values to accurately reflect the "Original Text."\n    * Adjust column widths and alignments as needed, ensuring the table is readable and well-structured in markdown format, while adhering to a simple and clear structure.\n4.  **Intelligent Interpretation:**\n    *   Use your understanding of the text and the feedback to make reasonable inferences when filling gaps.\n    *   Paraphrase or summarize as needed to maintain style consistency, unless verbatim insertion is specifically requested.\n5.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If feedback instructions conflict, prioritize "Missing Content" and "Incorrect Information" corrections over others.\n    *   If conflicts are too complex, flag them in your output. For instance, you can insert a comment like `` within the text where the conflict occurs.\n6.  **Reference:** Always refer to the "Original Text" to understand the context and intended meaning.\n7.  **Error Correction:** Apply corrections to the "Cleaned Text" as indicated in the "QA Feedback," but use your judgment to ensure the final text is coherent and complete.\n8.  **Proactive Error Detection:** If you identify potential errors not explicitly mentioned in the feedback but evident from comparing the "Cleaned Text" to the "Original Text," flag them in your output using a comment like ``.\n\n**QA Feedback Format:**\n\nThe QA feedback will follow this structured format:\n\n*   **Error Type:** (e.g., Missing Content, Incorrect Wording, Formatting Issue)\n*   **Description:** A detailed explanation of the error.\n*   **Location:** Precise location of the error, referencing both the "Original Text" (including page numbers if available) and the "Cleaned Text" (e.g., section, paragraph, line).\n*   **Suggestion:** A specific instruction on how to correct the error.\n\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The sentence "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known." is missing from the Restructured Output.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 4; Restructured Output, under "Recording treatments using an SMC card."\n- Suggestion: Insert the missing sentence to complete the paragraph.\n\n**Expected Action:** Locate the specified paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" under the section "Recording treatments using an SMC card". Consult the "Original Text," Page 4, to find the missing sentence. Insert the sentence, "In cases where the CHW does not know how to write, this is usually not a problem because the date of the first dose in each cycle is typically well known.", into the appropriate position within the paragraph in the "Cleaned Text" to ensure it is complete and aligns with the "Original Text."\n**Example QA Feedback and Expected Action:**\n- Error Type: Missing Content\n- Description: The Restructured Output is missing the detailed content from the Original Text starting from "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" onwards, including sections on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues.\n- Location: Original Text, Page 27 onwards; Restructured Output, after "Does it work?" section.\n- Suggestion: Add the missing sections to the Restructured Output to ensure all content is preserved.\n**Expected Action:**\nGo to the "Does it work?" section of the "Restructured Output". Then go to page 27 of the "Original Text", and locate the section "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?". Using the content in this section and subsequent sections (on mobile money providers, staff fraud, and other issues), add a new section titled "Does GiveDirectly have an effective process for getting cash to recipients?" to the "Restructured Output". Paraphrase and summarize the content from the Original Text to accurately reflect the information in the missing sections, ensuring logical flow and consistency with the existing text in the "Restructured Output". If this section is large, consider breaking it down into smaller subsections based on the content in the Original Text (e.g., "Mobile Money Providers," "Staff Fraud," "Other Issues").\n\n**Crucial Reminders:**\n\n*   Your primary goal is to produce a "Cleaned Text" that is faithful to the "Original Text," especially regarding content completeness.\n*   Address major content omissions before minor formatting issues.\n*   Use your judgment to interpret the feedback and reconstruct the text intelligently.\n*   Only output the corrected text without any additional commentary or headings, unless you need to flag a conflict or potential error as described above.\n', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': '\n            <QA Feedback>\n            # Error Type: Sentence Reconstruction Modification\n- Description: In the Original Text, the sentence regarding Paul\'s funds ends abruptly ("...but he does not currently have enough funds to") indicating an incomplete sentence, whereas in the Restructured Output this sentence has been modified to "complete Senior 4. Paul said that in the long run, he will be better off because of his spending on education." This alters the original wording by completing and changing the sentence structure.\n- Location: Original Text, Household #1 (Paul) on Page 2; Restructured Output, corresponding section under Household #1.\n- Suggestion: Retain the original sentence exactly as it appears, preserving the abrupt ending if that is how the original text was documented, to avoid altering the language and meaning.\n\n# Error Type: Sentence Merging Alteration\n- Description: The Restructured Output merges line breaks into well-formed sentences that differ slightly from the fragmented style of the Original Text. For example, the merging of "Paul said that if he were able to complete Senior 4, he could then go to school to become a mechanic, but he does not currently have enough funds to" with the subsequent sentence changes the original structure.\n- Location: Original Text, Household #1 (Paul) on Page 2; Restructured Output, corresponding paragraphs under Household #1.\n- Suggestion: Merge fragmented lines only for clarity when text is clearly divided by page breaks, but avoid adding words or completing sentences if the Original Text intentionally leaves them as is.\n\nFinal Recommendation: Revise the Restructured Output to match the Original Text exactly in terms of sentence structure and wording, ensuring that no sentences are altered beyond merely consolidating page breaks.\n            </QA Feedback>\n            <Cleaned Text>\n            **Site visit with GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014**\n\n**Participants**\n\n* Piali Mukhopadhyay - COO, International, GiveDirectly\n* Stuart Skeates - Uganda Field Director, GiveDirectly\n* Steven Olinga - Field Officer, GiveDirectly\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Josh Rosenberg - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of GiveWell\'s visit to GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda.\n\n## Summary\n\nOn October 20-21, 2014, GiveWell staff visited GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda. In addition to conversations with GiveDirectly staff, GiveWell went to 2 villages to meet with recipients and observed a cash out day.\n\n## Meeting with recipients\n\nOn October 20, 2014, we (GiveWell staff) travelled with GiveDirectly to Kavo and Apungure, adjacent villages located about one hour\'s drive outside of Mbale, a small city in southeastern Uganda. Both villages had been part of GiveDirectly\'s first campaign in Uganda (the "Uganda pilot"). At the time of our visit, all transfers had been made to households in that campaign, and final follow up surveys were ongoing. GiveDirectly had randomly selected a short list of households that we could visit, and then called each of them ahead of time to make an appointment. We ended up visiting 2 households in Kavo and 2 households in Apungure. We were accompanied on these visits by GiveDirectly staff, one of which translated our conversations with recipients. The below notes summarize what recipients told us in those conversations.\n\n**Household #1 (Paul)**\n\n* There are 11 people in Paul\'s family who all live on the same compound.\n* Paul is not married, he lives alone, and he is the only beneficiary in his family.\n* Paul farms, as does the rest of his family; Paul does not have any other jobs.\n* Paul received 2.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$960) from GiveDirectly. (50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) had been deducted because Paul opted to buy a cell phone through GiveDirectly, and the other 50,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$20) was taken in the case of GD staff fraud.)\n* Paul used 1 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$450) to cover 2 years of school fees (Senior 1 and Senior 2 levels.) Paul thinks he could pass the exams necessary to finish school, but has not sat for them (there are fees associated with secondary school exams). Paul said that if he were able to complete Senior 4, he could then go to school to become a mechanic, but he does not currently have enough funds to complete Senior 4. Paul said that in the long run, he will be better off because of his spending on education.\n* Paul used 450,000 UGX (~$180) to purchase 18 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX per sheet. He stores these iron sheets inside his father\'s house, which is larger and has an iron roof. Paul said that he does not have enough sheets for a full roof yet.\n* Paul said that he is trying to make bricks out of mud so that he can build a new house and put a roof on it by February 2015.\n* Paul said that he wants to replace his thatch roof because finding the special kind of grass needed for the roofs is difficult, and because sometimes termites attack him.\n* Paul used some of the funds for domestic expenses.\n* Paul has 300,000 UGX (~$120) left from the transfer; he is keeping this money (in cash) in case of an emergency.\n* Paul said that he chose to spend the money in these ways because his father has some land, which Paul expects to inherit some day.\n* When we asked about the money that had been deducted from his transfer, Paul said that he had been told 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the phone and 50,000 UGX (~$20) was for the SIM card, and that no one called the hotline to report this extremely high price for a SIM card because the person running the hotline was one of the staff who told recipients about the SIM card deduction.\n* When we asked if Paul thinks it would be better to give a smaller sized transfer to more people (rather than keeping transfer size at $1000), he said that since he\'s in need of more money, he wouldn\'t want to reduce the size of the transfer.\n* When we asked if there is anything that GD could do differently, Paul said increase the transfer size.\n* We also asked if Paul had seen any good or bad spending, and he said that some people spent money on alcohol.\n* Paul asked GiveDirectly staff if the deduction from his transfer was "genuine" and whether it would be replaced. GiveDirectly staff explained that the deduction for the phone was genuine, and the second one for the SIM card was not.\n\n### Household #2 (Gilbert)\n\n* There are 5 people in Gilbert\'s household: Gilbert, his wife, and 3 children.\n* Gilbert said that he received 2.39 million UGX (~$960) from GiveDirectly.\n* The first thing that Gilbert spent transfer funds on was domestic items that he lacked, including a mattress, plates, saucepans, and cups.\n* Gilbert used some of the transfer funds to build a brick and cement house with iron roof:\n  * Iron sheets were purchased from Katongole; 14 sheets at a price of 26,000 UGX per sheet\n  * Other building materials were purchased within his village\n  * Labor costs: 400,000 UGX (~$160) for masons, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for mixers, 200,000 UGX (~$80) for water for laborers\n  * House took 3 months to build\n\n### Household #3 (Scovia)\n\n* 5 people in Scovia\'s household: Scovia, her husband, their child, her husband\'s other wife (Scovia\'s "co-wife"), child of husband and co-wife.\n* Scovia was the official recipient. When we met with her near her household, her husband joined. Scovia\'s husband answered nearly all of the questions that we asked.\n* Scovia\'s husband told us that his father had incurred a debt of 20 cows, which he asked his sons for help in paying off. The debt was: 10 cows for the dowry from the father\'s marriage; 10 cows for traditional healing the father had sought as treatment for a problem with spirits.\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he spent 1.4 million UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$560) to purchase 2 bulls and 2 cows to help his father pay off this debt.\n* Paying off the debt from the traditional healing enabled Scovia\'s husband to reclaim some land.\n* Scovia\'s husband also spent 425,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$170) on 17 iron sheets at a price of 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10) per sheet. Scovia\'s husband said that he wanted to use the money to construct a new house but could not do so with the debt outstanding. He said that match roofs leak and the wind can blow them away.\n* Separate from the transfer, Scovia\'s husband had saved 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260) over about 1 year to buy a motorcycle, and he said he used the rest of the transfer (about 650,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$260)) to top up these funds and make the purchase. Scovia\'s husband said he has been working as a motorcycle taxi driver. On a bad day, his revenue is 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4), on a good day, his revenue is 25,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$10), and he spends about 10,000 UGX (\\(\\sim\\)$4) per day on food and gas when he is working.\n\n* Scovia\'s husband also said that he/his household [we didn\'t clarify] earn money by planting rice. In a good season, they will harvest 10 bags of 100kg each of rice, which brings in 2.5 million UGX ($1000).\n* Scovia\'s husband said that before receiving the transfer from GiveDirectly, getting a meal was a problem, and he didn\'t have seeds or land. Since receiving the transfer, he bought animals and got married.\n* Scovia said that she and her husband had agreed as to how to spend the money.\n* Scovia\'s husband said that he thinks his elder wife should be eligible for a transfer, though she did not receive one. He also asked about the transfer deductions from the staff fraud.\n\n#### Household #4 (Betty)\n\n* Betty lives in a match-roof house with her very young child, on a compound owned by her relatives.\n* Betty said that she has lived on her own for 3 years.\n* Betty farms, mostly for consumption, but will sell crops if she needs money for an emergency or to buy basics like soap, sugar, and medical treatments.\n* Betty used 2 million UGX (~$800) to buy a piece of land from her great uncle, which she paid for in installments as she received the transfer. Betty said that the time will come when she needs to be independent of her family and will build a house on the land. Currently she has used the land to plant cassava.\n* Other purchases: 60,000 UGX (~$24) on a mattress, 80,000 UGX (~$32) on bedding, 180,000 UGX (~$72) on pigs. Betty said that she bought the pigs young and plans to sell them once they reach adulthood.\n* There were multiple people sitting nearby as we spoke to Betty, she said that they are happy for her even though they didn\'t benefit, and that they think GiveDirectly might come back and give them transfers.\n* When we asked Betty if she thinks GiveDirectly should continue to give $1000 to people in one village or a smaller amount to people in more villages, she said that GiveDirectly should increase the amount of the transfer.\n\n### Observing a cash out day\n\n#### Why GiveDirectly conducts cash out days\n\nIn Uganda, GiveDirectly has coordinated cash out days to enable recipients to withdraw funds at a location in or very near to their villages. GiveDirectly coordinated cash out days because the agent network around their villages was not robust and lacked sufficient liquidity. Cash out days also reduce costs for recipients who would otherwise pay for transportation to a nearby agent.\n\n#### Our observations of a cash out day\n\nWe observed a cash out day in Uganda that took place in October 2014 as part of the Uganda 2M campaign. The below information is based on our observations of that cash out day and conversations about it with GiveDirectly staff.\n\nPrior to the cash out day, GiveDirectly had told recipients the location and time that they should arrive to withdraw funds. Stuart Skeates, the Uganda Field Director had also made arrangements with the mobile money agents who would attend to facilitate withdrawals. Upon arriving at the designated site for the cash out day (near a secondary school), many village members were already gathered.\n            </Cleaned Text>\n            <Original Text>\n            === Page 1 ===\n\n**Site visit with GiveDirectly, October 20-21, 2014**\n\n**Participants**\n\n* Piali Mukhopadhyay - COO, International, GiveDirectly\n* Stuart Skeates - Uganda Field Director, GiveDirectly\n* Steven Olinga - Field Officer, GiveDirectly\n* Eliza Scheffler - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n* Josh Rosenberg - Research Analyst, GiveWell\n\n**Note**: These notes were compiled by GiveWell and give an overview of GiveWell\'s visit to GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda. ## Summary\n\nOn October 20-21, 2014, GiveWell staff visited GiveDirectly\'s field operations in Uganda.

Gilbert said that he farms mainly for consumption, but could sell some of the produce in case of financial hardship. Gilbert farms maize, cassava, sweet potato and soya beans. * Gilbert said that he does not have enough land, so cannot raise animals. * Gilbert does not have any funds remaining from the transfer. * Gilbert said that he withdrew cash at the cash out days GiveDirectly coordinated at a nearby church, and that he stored materials because he could not store cash. * When we asked whether Gilbert thought it was better for households in one village to receive $1000 each or households in 2 villages to receive $500, he said that the amount of the transfer ($1000) should stay the same. * Gilbert said that no other charities work in his village. **Household #3 (Scovia)**\n\n* 5 people in Scovia\'s household: Scovia, her husband, their child, her husband\'s other wife (Scovia\'s "co-wife"), child of husband and co-wife. * Scovia was the official recipient.
