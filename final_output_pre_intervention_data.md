- **Quote:** Status: Baseline surveying and cash payments launched in 2019

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly systematically collects pre-intervention data (via baseline surveying) before launching cash transfers. Such early data collection is a key operational step that enables the organization to benchmark outcomes and later assess cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Status: Research ethics clearance secured, baseline survey due to launch Q4 2019

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that a baseline survey—an example of systematic pre-intervention data collection—is planned before implementing cash transfer interventions. Collecting this detailed information upfront is integral to evaluating the intervention’s impact and refining operational processes for cost efficiency.

- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly deliberately modified its enrollment process to collect baseline data before the intervention began. This systematic collection of pre-intervention data—through baseline surveys—serves as an operational decision that may ultimately inform cost-effective practices by providing detailed information about the beneficiaries and context before interventions are implemented.

- **Quote:** The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use. GiveDirectly may occasionally delay some transfers to help preserve a study's integrity, but generally it prefers not to suspend its activities due to delays by researchers.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the importance of starting pre-intervention data collection (the baseline study) early, which directly influences the quality and extent of the data gathered. Ensuring robust baseline data allows GiveDirectly to plan and execute operations more effectively, ultimately supporting cost-effectiveness by safeguarding the integrity of the intervention’s evaluation.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides a clear illustration of a pre-intervention data collection process—the baseline survey—that is critical enough to warrant operational adjustments (delaying transfers) to maintain research integrity. By securing proper pre-intervention data, GiveDirectly ensures that its randomized processes are not compromised, which in turn supports the cost-effectiveness of its operations by avoiding inefficiencies linked to flawed evaluations.

- **Quote:** All enrollment in Kenya is taking place in Homa Bay County, using new targeting criteria. These are not the same criteria used in Uganda, which still uses the old targeting criteria. The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected qualitative data through focus groups prior to finalizing new targeting criteria. By gathering this pre-intervention feedback, the organization was able to refine its operational processes—ensuring that its methods for selecting beneficiaries (e.g., identifying particularly vulnerable groups like widows) are based on locally relevant data. This process can contribute to cost-effectiveness by improving targeting and resource allocation.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collects pre-intervention data—specifically, observable household characteristics (i.e., thatch roofs) that signal poverty—in order to efficiently target the needy. Such targeted selection is a key operational process that maximizes the impact of cash transfers, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** At baseline, food security was low among participants.

  **Reasoning:** This statement reflects the systematic collection of baseline (pre-intervention) data. By establishing pre-intervention benchmarks like food security levels, the program can later measure its impact accurately, informing adjustments and contributing to robust cost‐effectiveness analyses.

- **Quote:** 1. Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that before implementing the intervention, DSW systematically uses pre-intervention data—such as health and water source metrics—to select operational areas. This data-driven decision process is essential for ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently, thereby contributing to the overall cost effectiveness of the charity's operations.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that IPA collected baseline data before the intervention, establishing a clear picture of initial conditions. Such pre-intervention data allows the organization to measure impact post-intervention and informs strategic decisions that enhance both operational efficiency and cost effectiveness.
