- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly deliberately modified its operational process (slowing enrollment) to accommodate the collection of pre-intervention baseline data. Such baseline surveys, collected before the intervention, are intended to inform evaluations of the intervention’s impact and efficiency, thereby potentially contributing to the cost effectiveness of the charity's operations.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how pre-intervention data collection—in this case, a baseline survey—is integral to operational decision-making. By delaying token transfers to ensure the baseline was properly completed, GiveDirectly maintained the validity of its randomization process. This operational adjustment helps safeguard the integrity of the intervention measurement, an essential factor in achieving cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data through focus groups to gather contextual feedback prior to finalizing their targeting criteria. By using this pre-intervention information to inform their operational process (i.e., designing targeting criteria), the organization aims to optimize its cost effectiveness, ensuring resources reach the most vulnerable groups efficiently.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates an operational process where pre-intervention observable data (i.e. the use of thatch roofs as an indicator of poverty) is used to target beneficiaries. By collecting and using this pre-intervention information, the charity ensures that resources are directed to the most needful households, which is a key component in maintaining cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote, taken from the operational process description, demonstrates that pre-intervention data (such as health indicators and water source characteristics) is actively used to select target areas. By leveraging this information before implementing the intervention, the charity can focus on locations with the greatest potential impact, a key step in ensuring cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides evidence of pre-intervention data collection through baseline measurements, which establishes the existing level of water treatment within communities. Such data informs operational decisions by clarifying the intervention’s necessity and helps in tailoring efforts to improve outcomes cost-effectively.
