### Paul Niehaus, GiveDirectly, 9-5-2014 (public).md - worth reading
- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly deliberately prioritized collecting detailed pre-intervention data (through baseline surveys) by adjusting its operational timeline. While the quote does not explicitly mention cost-effectiveness, it implies that obtaining detailed contextual information before fully implementing its intervention could inform and refine subsequent operational processes, potentially contributing to more cost-effective program delivery.

- **Quote:** In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention data collection process—the baseline survey—that is essential for preserving the study’s design (randomization). Collecting detailed pre-transfer information helps ensure that operational decisions, such as delaying transfers when necessary, protect the integrity of the intervention, indirectly supporting cost-effective use of resources.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has tested the performance of potential eligibility metrics by examining the internal consistency of their results, as well as comparing metrics to each other and to the GE study baseline data.

  **Reasoning:** Here, GiveDirectly is using detailed pre-intervention data (eligibility metrics and baseline data) to refine its targeting strategy. By analyzing the data before implementing cash transfers, the charity can improve its targeting efficiency, thereby contributing to operational processes that uphold its cost-effectiveness objectives.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-intervention data collection process where detailed local feedback was gathered to inform the development of targeting criteria. By collecting such detailed information before finalizing the criteria, GiveDirectly is better able to tailor its operational processes to effectively target vulnerable groups, which can contribute to more cost-effective program delivery.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly’s standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that before implementing the cash transfer intervention, GiveDirectly collects detailed local information (e.g., the type of roof a household has) as an objective indicator of poverty. Such targeted, pre-intervention data helps the organization efficiently identify beneficiaries and thus contributes to a cost‐effective operational process.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs. This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that detailed information (in this case, local roof cost data) is gathered to inform critical economic assumptions—like the returns on investment associated with replacing or upgrading roofs. Collecting such detailed cost data before or during planning assists in refining cost‐effectiveness analyses and optimizing operational decisions.

- **Quote:** 1. Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that before implementing the intervention, DSW collects detailed data on health and water source indicators to select target areas. Using such pre-intervention information helps ensure that resources are directed where they can yield the greatest impact, thereby contributing to cost-effective operational processes.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights the role of baseline data collection in understanding the pre-existing conditions of water treatment practices. Such detailed pre-intervention information is crucial for planning and evaluating the intervention's effectiveness, which in turn supports more efficient and cost-effective operations.



## MalariaConsortium
### 2020 Charity Report_2.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** Through our role in the PMI VectorLink project, we have been supporting a number of countries directly to shape their vector control policies and strategies. We have supported Malawi and Kenya to develop their national integrated vector control strategies and insecticide resistance management plans, to guide evidence-based selection of appropriate interventions that are tailored to local epidemiological settings.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that Malaria Consortium collects and uses local epidemiological information to inform and tailor intervention strategies before implementation. By basing the selection of interventions on evidence gathered beforehand, the organisation enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its operations.


### 2020 Charity Report.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Macro-planning typically begins around five months before the start of the annual SMC round. This involves agreeing campaign dates and modalities at the national and state levels, as well as discussing adaptations to the SMC intervention tools and guidelines. Micro-planning is conducted several months before the start of the SMC round, including budgeting based on detailed enumeration of the target population at the subnational level, required personnel, and commodities.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates the pre-intervention data collection process—specifically, the detailed enumeration of the target population and resource requirements—that informs budgeting and planning. By gathering this information before implementation, the organization is able to allocate resources effectively and tailor the operational processes to the local context, thereby contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Under the HBHI initiative’s 'strategic information' response element, the PNLP conducted a stratification exercise with support from WHO, the Institute for Disease Modeling, and Northwestern University to determine the optimal mix of malaria interventions at the health district level. The exercise involved stratifying health districts based on epidemiological characteristics including prevalence, incidence, and all-cause mortality among children under five, and combining the epidemiological information with measures of seasonality, urbanization, and access to care.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates how collecting and analyzing epidemiological data prior to intervention—such as prevalence, incidence, and other key indicators—allows for the tailoring of intervention strategies to the specific needs of different areas. This targeted approach supports cost-effective operations by ensuring that resources are directed to areas with the greatest need and potential impact.

- **Quote:** In February and March, Akros facilitated an in-depth data discovery and mapping exercise to understand and document information related to key SMC stakeholders, the workflow of the SMC campaign, and how data tools are used throughout SMC workflows.

  **Reasoning:** This statement provides evidence of a pre-intervention information-gathering effort using digital tools to map stakeholder roles and operational workflows. Such data collection enables the optimization of planning and monitoring processes, leading to more efficient resource use and overall cost effectiveness in executing the intervention.


### 2016-11-09 Interview Notes.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Before beginning to use SMC cards to measure coverage, Malaria Consortium pretested the use of the cards in different countries and modified the design of the cards based on feedback from these tests. Once a final version was created, Malaria Consortium used monitoring tools to test the card's efficacy as a means of measuring coverage during its project in Katsina State, Nigeria, which was a smaller-scale intervention in a more controlled environment than its current programs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that Malaria Consortium undertook pre-intervention testing and data collection to refine their tools (SMC cards). By gathering information and feedback before a full-scale intervention, they improved measurement accuracy and operational efficiency, indirectly contributing to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** In its discussions with the ministries of health and in the process of rolling out its programs in-country, Malaria Consortium looked for existing household registration tools already in use in the same geographical areas as its programs. In some areas, it took advantage of existing household registers used in other programs (such as nutrition, integrated community case management, and neglected tropical disease programs) in order to adapt and simplify the tool it developed. Malaria Consortium also pre-tested the household registration tool to help simplify its design.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that prior to implementation, the organization collected information on existing data collection tools and pre-tested their adapted household registration tool. This pre-intervention data collection contributes to designing streamlined operational processes, which can enhance cost effectiveness by reducing redundant efforts and optimizing resource use.


### 2021 GiveWell Funding Gap.md - important to read
- **Quote:** The grant was intended to pay for staff time spent collecting information on the funding situation for LLIN campaigns in several countries and suggesting priorities for additional funding for LLIN campaigns.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that, before any LLIN intervention was implemented, resources were specifically allocated to collect data regarding the funding situation. This pre-intervention data collection serves as a foundational process to identify gaps and potential cost-effective opportunities in the intervention strategy.

- **Quote:** Scoping efforts paid for by the grant had the potential to identify highly cost-effective funding opportunities.

  **Reasoning:** Here, the text directly links the act of pre-intervention information gathering (scoping) with the identification of funding opportunities that are cost effective. This supports the notion that collecting such information informs and optimizes operational processes by targeting the most efficient interventions.

- **Quote:** While Malaria Consortium may have been able and willing to conduct this scoping work without a grant, we believed providing this relatively small amount of funding and agreeing upon the scope and timeline for the project in advance would increase the likelihood that Malaria Consortium would prioritize it more highly than it would have otherwise.

  **Reasoning:** This quote emphasizes that formalizing the data collection process through dedicated funding and scheduling increases prioritization within the organization. This enhancement in operational priority through structured pre-intervention efforts is a critical factor in ensuring cost-effectiveness.


### 2021 GiveWell Summary.md - important to read
- **Quote:** Malaria Consortium told us that before starting work in countries under the ACCESS-SMC program, it conducted an assessment of the overall burden of malaria, transmission and rainfall patterns, regional malaria incidence over time, and seasonal variations in malaria.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides direct evidence that pre-intervention data collection was undertaken by Malaria Consortium to evaluate malaria burden and seasonal patterns before rolling out the SMC intervention. Such assessments inform which areas are most suitable for intervention, thereby supporting subsequent cost-effective planning and operations.


### 2021 Info on Intervention.md - worth reading
- **Quote:** In 2016 we completed an interim intervention report on SMC. We reviewed the Cochrane Collaboration review (discussed above), the ACCESS‐SMC website, the section of the WHO website devoted to SMC, and some documents provided to us by Malaria Consortium.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that before committing to an intervention, GiveWell systematically gathers diverse sources of information. This pre-intervention research process informs their cost‐effectiveness analysis and operational decisions, supporting the idea that collecting detailed information about a charitable cause can enhance operational efficiency.

- **Quote:** We investigated a small number of high‐priority research questions based on our impression of the likelihood that they could substantively change our view of SMC: We reviewed the individual studies in the Cochrane Collaboration review and removed one (Dicko et al. 2008) because it delivered treatments bi‐monthly rather than monthly. We searched for additional RCTs published after the Cochrane Collaboration review and added one (Tagbor et al. 2016) to the meta‐analysis. We investigated possible negative / offsetting impacts including (i) possible emergence of drug resistance, (ii) possible interaction with ITNs, (iii) rebound effects. We updated our coverage adjustment to account for imperfect coverage in the trials in the Cochrane Collaborate review. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity in the effects of SMC, which we will use to inform our questions for potential top charities.

  **Reasoning:** This passage illustrates how GiveWell refines its operational models by collecting and analyzing pre‐intervention data. By reviewing and adjusting for variables such as treatment frequency, coverage, and heterogeneity in trial results, they ensure that their cost‐effectiveness estimates are based on up‐to‐date, accurate information. This process supports the research question’s focus on the role of information gathering in optimizing the operational processes that contribute to charity cost effectiveness.
