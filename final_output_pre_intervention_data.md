- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a deliberate operational decision made by GiveDirectly to pause the rollout of an intervention in order to collect baseline data prior to the intervention. While it does not explicitly mention cost effectiveness, gathering pre-intervention data (in this case via baseline surveys) provides foundational information that can inform and optimize later operational decisions, potentially contributing to more cost-effective approaches.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates the operational importance of collecting pre-intervention data—a baseline survey conducted before token transfers—to preserve the integrity of randomization. By ensuring that no intervention occurs before data collection, GiveDirectly avoids the need for costly re-randomization or wasted transfers, thus indirectly supporting cost-effective operations.

- **Quote:** The sooner an academic team can begin its baseline study, the larger the sample it can use.

  **Reasoning:** This statement underscores the benefit of initiating data collection prior to delivering interventions. A larger baseline sample enhances the reliability and robustness of the data, which informs operational decisions and resource allocation, ultimately contributing to improved cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data—feedback from focus groups—to inform and shape their new targeting criteria. By integrating such pre-intervention insights, the charity can design operational processes that better identify vulnerable populations, potentially leading to more precise resource allocation and increased cost-effectiveness.


### Cash Transfers _ GiveWell.md - important to read
- **Quote:** GiveDirectly is an organization that delivers unconditional cash transfers to poor households in Kenya through a mobile money system called M-Pesa.102 While it has altered its model for various experiments, GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.103 Please see our review of GiveDirectly for much more detail on GiveDirectly's program.

  **Reasoning:** This quote directly illustrates an operational process where pre-intervention data (household characteristics such as roof type) is used to identify the target population. By collecting such data before implementing the intervention, GiveDirectly can efficiently target the poorest households thereby enhancing the cost‐effectiveness of its charitable efforts.

- **Quote:** Food security. At baseline, food security was low among participants. Program participants reported a 0.37 standard deviation (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.57) increase in a food security index over controls.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that baseline (pre-intervention) data collection provides a benchmark on key outcomes (in this case, food security) which is crucial for later assessing the impact of the intervention. Such measurement is fundamental to conducting accurate cost‐effectiveness analyses and informs operational decisions by revealing the degree of improvement relative to the initial conditions.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that IPA collects pre-intervention (baseline) data to understand the existing level of water treatment in the community. Such data helps in evaluating the impact of the intervention by establishing a reference point, which is crucial for tracking improvements and justifying cost-effective allocation of resources.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote outlines an operational process where pre-intervention data is used to select intervention sites. By targeting areas based on existing health and infrastructure data, DSW can ensure that resources are directed to locations with the greatest need, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.
