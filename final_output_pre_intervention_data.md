- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly deliberately collected pre-intervention baseline data before the full rollout of its program. Although it doesn’t explicitly mention cost effectiveness, slowing enrollment to gather detailed information indicates that the charity leverages early data collection to refine and inform its operational processes.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly has identified five or six districts in Siaya County in Kenya that are poor enough to be eligible for its program. GiveDirectly has worked in one and received approval to work in a second (Ugunja Division).

  **Reasoning:** This passage implies that GiveDirectly uses pre-intervention information—identifying eligible, impoverished districts—to strategically select locations for its programs. Such data-informed site selection is a key component of operational planning that can help optimize resource allocation and support cost-effective interventions.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study. This is why the amount of time elapsed between the census and the token transfer in Kenya has recently been greater than usual.

  **Reasoning:** This quote clearly shows that GiveDirectly collects pre-intervention information (through a baseline survey) and uses that data to inform its operational processes—in this case, delaying token transfers to ensure valid randomization. By prioritizing the collection of baseline data before implementing the intervention, the organization is able to adjust its timeline and operational decisions, which is essential for maintaining its cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly gathered information through focus groups prior to fully implementing new targeting criteria—demonstrating a pre-intervention data collection process. By incorporating community feedback before finalizing its operational procedures, GiveDirectly aims to enhance the effectiveness and potentially the cost-efficiency of its interventions, thereby addressing the research question.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly uses pre-intervention information—specifically, the observable criterion of having thatch roofs—to target its beneficiaries. By collecting such data before implementing the cash transfer, the charity refines its operational process, ensuring that resources are directed to the neediest households, an essential element for achieving cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly also conducted a survey on roof costs.75 This survey found costs that imply an annual investment return of 48%.76

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that gathering context-specific data (in this case, local roof costs) is used to inform estimates of investment returns. Such pre-intervention data collection is integral to developing accurate cost-effectiveness models, therefore guiding the charity’s operational decisions to optimize resource allocation and overall efficiency.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates that DSW collects and uses pre-intervention data to identify locations most in need of their services. By gathering information on local health indicators and water source characteristics before launching the intervention, they can target areas where the impact will be maximized, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that even before full-scale implementation, DSW gathers information on community response and behavior. Collecting such data in a pre-intervention phase helps DSW adjust operational processes based on evidence gathered from early demonstrations, which can optimize resource allocation and contribute to overall cost-effectiveness.
