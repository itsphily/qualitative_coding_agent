- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote highlights a deliberate decision to collect pre-intervention (baseline) data, demonstrating that GiveDirectly values such information. Although the text does not explicitly link this action to operational cost‐effectiveness, the decision to slow enrollment for baseline surveys implies that accurate pre-intervention data is considered essential for effective planning and may contribute indirectly to making operations more cost‐effective.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them. After debating the pros and cons, GiveDirectly decided to delay the token transfers to preserve the viability of the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates that GiveDirectly prioritizes the collection of pre-intervention data—in this case, a baseline survey—by delaying token transfers to ensure the validity of its experimental design. Maintaining rigorous baseline data collection preserves the integrity of the randomization, which is essential for accurately evaluating program outcomes and cost-effectiveness, thereby indirectly supporting operational efficiency.

- **Quote:** the new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote indicates that GiveDirectly collected pre-intervention data (through focus groups conducted before the new targeting criteria were finalized) to inform its operational decisions. This pre-intervention feedback potentially contributes to cost-effectiveness by ensuring the intervention targets the most vulnerable groups, thereby optimizing resource allocation and streamlining operations.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote, taken from the pre-intervention planning phase, illustrates how DSW collects and uses data before implementing their intervention. By targeting areas based on indicators like disease rates and water source types, the organization can allocate resources more efficiently, a practice that likely contributes to operational cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote provides an example of pre-intervention data collection. Establishing a baseline measurement prior to implementation allows the charity to evaluate the incremental impact of the intervention, thereby supporting decisions that can enhance the cost-effectiveness of operational strategies.
