- **Quote:** At one point, GiveDirectly intentionally slowed enrollment in Kenya in order for researchers to conduct baseline surveys for the GE study.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly altered its operational process—specifically, slowing down enrollment—to ensure that pre-intervention baseline data could be collected. The adjustment highlights how the requirement for pre-intervention data collection can influence operational decisions, a factor that may ultimately contribute to cost-effective program implementation.

- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how collecting pre-intervention data—in this case, a baseline survey—is factored into GiveDirectly's operational decisions. The need to complete the survey before initiating transfers influenced the charity's timeline and caused delays, a clear example of how pre-intervention data collection can impact and necessitate adjustments in operational processes that underpin cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested. GiveDirectly is not soliciting any explicit feedback on the fairness of the new criteria, and so far has not heard of any issues with fairness in targeting.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that pre-intervention data – in this case, qualitative feedback from focus groups – was used to shape the targeting criteria before full implementation. The operational process of refining targeting criteria based on such pre-intervention insights can contribute to ensuring that resources are allocated more effectively, which in turn can enhance cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that before any dispensers are installed, DSW uses pre-intervention data (e.g., local health metrics and water source characteristics) to decide where to operate. This data-driven site selection is an operational process that aids in targeting resources to areas of greatest need, potentially enhancing cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** At baseline in one of IPA's studies of chlorine dispensers, 4% of people were treating their water with other chlorination products. In other cases, the baseline fluctuated, but was always below 10%.

  **Reasoning:** This quote presents baseline data collected before the intervention, providing a snapshot of existing water treatment practices. By documenting low pre-intervention usage, it underlines the need for the intervention and informs planning, allowing the charity to allocate resources more efficiently.
