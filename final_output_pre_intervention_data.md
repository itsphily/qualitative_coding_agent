- **Quote:** The GE study in Siaya is an example of how research studies can affect GiveDirectly's timeline. In that case, GiveDirectly moved more quickly than anticipated, and so had to delay the token transfers for some of its recipients to give the GE team enough time to conduct its baseline survey, which had to be completed before the token transfers were sent. This was a difficult decision, because GiveDirectly does not want to make recipients wait for their transfers; however, not doing so would have invalidated the randomization for the study, as some community members would have been treated prior to the baseline. The households in Siaya could have been re-randomized, but GiveDirectly had already treated most of them.

  **Reasoning:** This quote shows that GiveDirectly collected baseline data before implementing transfers, and the resulting information directly affected operational decisions (such as delaying token transfers) to preserve the integrity of the intervention. In doing so, the organization adjusted its timeline to maintain the study’s validity—a process that reflects how pre-intervention information collection can inform processes that help sustain cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Modified criteria for eligibility
  The presence of a thatched roof on a household's dwelling will continue to serve as a proxy test for extreme poverty whenever GiveDirectly enters a new area. However, GiveDirectly is exploring other tests to see whether they perform better at targeting households for cash transfers. In Homa Bay County, thatch is not commonly used, so a different proxy means test is needed.

  **Reasoning:** This excerpt indicates that GiveDirectly gathers contextual data (such as housing features that serve as proxies for extreme poverty) before launching interventions in new areas. By using pre-intervention assessments to choose the appropriate targeting criteria, the organization refines its operational processes, which is integral to achieving cost-effectiveness in its charitable activities.

- **Quote:** The new criteria took into account feedback from focus groups (e.g., feedback about the importance of widows as a particularly vulnerable group), which were conducted before the criteria were fully tested.

  **Reasoning:** This quote demonstrates a pre-intervention data collection process where GiveDirectly gathered qualitative information through focus groups. The feedback obtained was then used to shape the operational targeting criteria, illustrating how collecting pre-intervention information about the charitable cause can inform operational processes that potentially contribute to cost effectiveness.

- **Quote:** GiveDirectly's standard model involves transferring $1,000 to poor households, which are identified by their use of thatch roofs.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates how GiveDirectly collects pre-intervention information—using a simple observable marker (thatched roofs) as an indicator of poverty—to efficiently target beneficiaries. By leveraging such clear, cost-effective data prior to implementation, the organization streamlines its operational processes, contributing to its overall cost-effectiveness.

- **Quote:** Choose areas in which DSW will work using data on diarrhea rates/waterborne disease, prevalence and type of water sources, and population density.

  **Reasoning:** This pre-intervention step explicitly shows that DSW collects contextual information about local health challenges and water source characteristics before implementing the intervention. By selecting areas based on these data, they can target communities where the intervention would have the most impact, thereby supporting cost‐effective operations.

- **Quote:** For example, at the village meeting prior to installation, DSW plans to demonstrate improved water quality using chlorine-treated and untreated water and a chemical which changes color in the presence of bacterial contamination. DSW will also collect data on what percentage of people who attend that meeting then chlorinate their water.

  **Reasoning:** This quote illustrates a pre-installation activity where DSW gathers information on community behavior and response. By collecting data on water chlorination uptake at these meetings, the organization can refine its operational processes and strategies, ultimately contributing to more cost-effective intervention deployment.
