# Specification Template
> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy the High and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High-Level Objective

- [High level goal goes here - what do you want to build?]

## Mid-Level Objective

- [List of mid-level objectives - what are the steps to achieve the high-level objective?]
- [Each objective should be concrete and measurable]
- [But not too detailed - save details for implementation notes]

## Implementation Notes
- All the functions that are added to the file must be added before the if main == "__main__": block.
- When adding nodes and edges to the graph make sure they are in the appropriate section (there is one section for the nodes and one for the edges). Also make sure to place them in order.
- Here are mandatory urls you need to consult before starting to code this project:
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/map-reduce/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/branching/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/state-reducers/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/state-model/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/input_output_schema/
    - https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/subgraph/
- Always make the necessary imports, add them to the requirements.txt file and keep all the imports at the top of the file.
- Every function should be properly commented, see proper commenting example below.
- Keep all the LLM initializations at the top of the file.

<node function example>
In this example, the node function is generate_joke. It takes the JokeState and returns an attribute(jokes) of the JokeState.
def generate_joke(state: JokeState):
    """
    Joke prompt that we format with the subject
    """
    prompt = joke_prompt.format(subject=state["subject"])
    response = model.with_structured_output(Joke).invoke(prompt)
    """
    return jokes, we are writing this to the jokes state in the overall state.
    We are passing it as a list so that it is appended to the jokes list.
    """
    return {"jokes": [response.joke]}
</node function example>

<send API example>
def continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):
    """
    We have this list in state. 
    We iterate through that list and for every subject in that list, we can use send to send it to a particular node.
    this will spawn a new generate_joke node for each subject, based on the size of the subjects list.
 
    The subject key is in the generate_joke state. 
    But the generate_joke state can contain whatever you want (it can have any state you want)
    """
    return [Send("generate_joke", {"subject": s}) for s in state["subjects"]]
</send API example>

<proper commenting example>
def test_function(p1, p2, p3):
    """
    test_function does blah blah blah.

    :param p1: describe about parameter p1
    :param p2: describe about parameter p2
    :param p3: describe about parameter p3
    :return: describe what it returns
    """ 
    pass
</proper commenting example>

## Context

### Beginning context
- [List of files that exist at start - what files exist at start?]

### Ending context  
- [List of files that will exist at end - what files will exist at end?]

```
2. [Second task - what is the second task?]
```aider

What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```
3. [Third task - what is the third task?]
```aider
