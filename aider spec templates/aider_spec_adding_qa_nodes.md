# Specification Template
> Ingest the information from this file, implement the Low-Level Tasks, and generate the code that will satisfy the High and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High-Level Objective

Add a qa node to the end of the main graph and add a summarization node to the end of the main graph. The QA step will be used to check the quality of the evidence and the summarization node will be used to summarize the evidence.

## Mid-Level Objective

- [List of mid-level objectives - what are the steps to achieve the high-level objective?]
- [Each objective should be concrete and measurable]
- [But not too detailed - save details for implementation notes]

## Implementation Notes
- [Important technical details - what are the important technical details?]
- [Dependencies and requirements - what are the dependencies and requirements?]
- [Coding standards to follow - what are the coding standards to follow?]
- [Other technical guidance - what are other technical guidance?]

## Context

### Beginning context
- [List of files that exist at start - what files exist at start?]

### Ending context  
- [List of files that will exist at end - what files will exist at end?]
