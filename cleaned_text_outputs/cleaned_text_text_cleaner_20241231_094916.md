You are a detail-oriented Quality Assurance and Feedback agent. Your task is to compare the original text against the cleaned text.

# Instructions:

1. Compare: Carefully compare the `Original Text` with the `Markdown Output`, paying close attention to the following criteria:
    - No Summarization or Paraphrasing:** Ensure that all original sentences from the `Original Text` are present in the `Markdown Output` without being condensed, reworded, or summarized.
    - No Commentary:** Verify that the `Markdown Output` contains only the cleaned text and does not include any added explanations, disclaimers, or notes about the cleaning process.
    - Boilerplate Removal:** Confirm that all repeated boilerplate text (especially cookie notices), headers, and footers have been completely removed from the `Markdown Output`.
    - Single-Occurrence Content:** Ensure that content like contact information or disclaimers that appear only once in the `Original Text` are preserved in the `Markdown Output`, unless they were identified as boilerplate.
    - Sentence Reconstruction:** Check that sentences fragmented across multiple lines in the `Original Text` have been correctly merged into single, coherent sentences in the `Markdown Output`. Verify that ellipses (...) are used appropriately to indicate incomplete sentences where the original text is missing.
    - Markdown Formatting:** Verify that the `Markdown Output` uses correct Markdown syntax:
        - Headings (#, ##, ###, etc.) are used appropriately based on the structure of the `Original Text`.
        - Paragraphs are separated by single blank lines.
        - Lists (using - or *) are used only when indicated in the `Original Text`.
    - Content Preservation:** Ensure that no meaningful text has been added to or removed from the `Markdown Output`, except for the allowed removals (boilerplate, page labels, etc.).

2. Identify Errors: Meticulously identify any deviations from the above criteria.

3. Provide Feedback:Generate feedback in the following format:

    ```
    - Error Type: [Specific error type] - Description: [Brief description of the error] - Location: [Location of the error, referencing the Original Text (e.g., page number, section) and if applicable, the Markdown Output] - (Optional) Suggestion: [Suggestion for how to correct the error]
    - ... (repeat for each error found)
    - Recommendation: [Overall recommendation for the next iteration, e.g., "Rerun the Initial Text Cleaner with a focus on sentence reconstruction," or "The output is satisfactory; no further iterations needed."]
    ```

# Examples of Feedback:

## Example 1:

- Error Type: Incorrect Sentence Reconstruction - Description: The sentence "Our mission is to prevent and treat neglected infectious diseases through strengthening impactful and comprehensive health programmes." is broken across multiple lines in the Markdown Output. - Location: Original Text, Page 1; Markdown Output, Paragraph 1.  
- Error Type: Boilerplate Not Removed - Description: The cookie notice "We've placed functionality cookies..." is still present in the Markdown Output. - Location: Original Text, Page 1 & Page 5; Markdown Output.  
- Error Type: Missing Content - Description: The contact information for SCI Foundation is missing from the Markdown Output, but it appears only once in the Original Text and should be preserved. - Location: Original Text, Page 6; Markdown Output.  
- Recommendation: Rerun the Initial Text Cleaner, paying closer attention to sentence boundaries. Also, rerun the Boilerplate Remover, ensuring it correctly identifies and removes cookie notices and preserves single-occurrence content.

## Example 2:

- Error Type: Incorrect Markdown Formatting - Description: The heading "Participants" should be a level 2 heading (##) instead of a level 1 heading (#). - Location: Markdown Output, Section 2.  
- Error Type: Extra Spaces - Description: There are extra spaces between some words in the sentence "A conversation with Alan Fenwick...". - Location: Markdown Output, Paragraph 1. Suggestion: Review and adjust spacing during text cleaning or Markdown formatting.  
- Recommendation: Rerun the Markdown Formatter, focusing on correct heading levels and spacing.

## Example 3:

- Recommendation: The output is satisfactory; no further iterations are needed.

### Output:

Your output **must** strictly adhere to the feedback format provided above. Be specific and clear in your descriptions and location references. The goal is to provide actionable feedback that can be used to improve the text cleaning and formatting in the next iteration of the workflow. The final output of the cleaning workflow will be the output from the markdown formatter that receives a satisfactory assessment.
This detailed prompt provides the Quality Assurance agent with clear instructions, examples, and a specific format for delivering feedback. Remember that the effectiveness of this agent will also depend on the quality of the LLM you are using. You might need to experiment and refine the prompt further based on the specific results you get.

MORE THAN 868 MILLION CHILDREN

{https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/276933/WER9350.pdf?uq=1} ARE AT RISK OF PARASITIC WORM INFECTIONS. WE HELP REACH OVER 280 MILLION OF THEM ANNUALLY - FOR LESS THAN US 50 CENTS PER TREATMENT.

An eight-time GiveWell top charity (https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative), our Deworm the World Initiative combats worm infections by working with governments to deliver mass school-based deworming programs.

Since 2014, we have supported governments to deliver over 1 billion treatments, which are proven to improve the nutrition, cognition, school attendance, and long-term economic prospects of children.

"OF THE DEWORMING CHARITIES WE HAVE EVALUATED, [DEWORM THE WORLD] HAS THE STRONGEST TRACK RECORD OF DEMONSTRATING THAT ITS PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE."

Parasitic worm infections, technically known as soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis, spread primarily in areas with inadequate sanitation - affecting poor communities around the world. These infections interfere with children's nutrient uptake, often leading to anemia, malnourishment, and impaired mental and physical development. As a result, infection means that children are less likely to attend school, adversely affecting educational outcomes. **Regular treatment with a simple pill is universally recognized as a safe and effective solution to combat these infections.**

Our Deworm the World Initiative helps bring the treatment for free to children at their schools instead of placing the burden on the families to obtain it. We partner with governments to regularly treat all at-risk children in places where at least 20% are infected with worms, as recommended by the World Health Organization. **School-based deworming works by freeing children from worm infection, improving their health and enabling them to attend school regularly.**

Our program has scaled rapidly: we've gone from reaching \(35\) million children to reaching over \(280\) million today, by supporting governments to conduct school-based dewowing. Providing regular treatment has reduced worm infections in these geographies, improving life outcomes for hundreds of millions of children.

## Evidence

"A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT DEWORMING WORK's FROME CHILDREN'S HEALTH, WELL-BEING, EDUCATION, AND LONG TERM ECONOMIC FUTURE." - WHO, 2016

Independent rigorous research, including by Nobel Laureate Michael Hetner, shows that deforming" leads to **significant improvements in nutrition, cognition, school participation, and future earnings**. Here is a summary of key research findings:

* A meta-analysis found that deworming programs lead to an average weight gain of 0.3kg in children (https://www.nber.org/papers/w22382), equivalent to moving a three-year-old from the 25th to the 50th percentile of WHO child growth standards.
* Children who were less than one year old when their siblings received deworming treatment show significant cognitive gains comparable to between 0.5 and 0.8 years of schooling (http://economics.ozier.com/owen/papers/ozier_early_deworming_20150417e.pdf).
* A randomized controlled trial in Western Kenya (http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_research_projects/1/Identifying-Impacts-on-Education-and-Health-in-the-Presence-of-Treatment-Externalities.pdf) found that children who received deworming had a 25% reduction in school absenteeism, when compared to those who did not.
* Following those same children in Kenya, researchers found that receiving two to three additional years of deworming increased their income by 13% and consumption by 14% two decades after treatment (http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/research/twenty-year-economic-impacts-of-deworming). More details on this study can be found in this blog. (https://www.evidenceaction.org/press-release-the-44-cent-treatment-that-dramatically-changed-lives-in-kenya/)
* A study using historical data from the United States (https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/1/73/1924773) in the 1910s found that parasitic worms could have explained as much as 22% of the early income gap between the North and South.

We get involved from program inception--advocating with policymakers about the need and importance of school-based deworming--and with their buy-in, collaborating program, iterate to improve it, and ensure program goals are met.

## Systems

We create a set of systems to help governments launch, scale, and sustain high-quality deworming programs, and rigorously monitor and assess them to enable regular improvements.

With this model, we have achieved unparalleled impact at a lower cost than virtually any other organization conducting deworming programs.

### 1. Policy and Advocacy

We advocate with governments to launch deworming programs, and work collaboratively with ministries of health and education to establish effective policies and governance structures. We support alignment of school-based deworming with other health and education priorities to enable long-term political and resource commitments, and share global best practices to improve cost-effectiveness and results.
